Chromecast still does not handle subtitles, so the English subtitles have been overlayed directly on the video image with this download.\n\nIf you are looking for a sci-fi &quot;action&quot; film, look elsewhere. Solyaris is a &quot;thinking man's&quot; movie. For English speaking viewers, after watching 1972 Solyaris, I recommend watching the 2002 Solaris remake. The 1972 original will help in better understanding the 2002 film and vice versa.\n\nVideo: H264 ( 1280 x 544 ) --- Audio: AAC (m4a) mono 48000\n\nMovie file with embedded subtitles was created using VLC from 5GB BluRay RIP\n\n---\n\nIMDB: The Solaris mission has established a base on a planet that appears to host some kind of intelligence, but the details are hazy and very secret. After the mysterious demise of one of the three scientists on the base, the main character is sent out to replace him. He finds the station run-down and the two remaining scientists cold and secretive. When he also encounters his wife who has been dead for ten years, he begins to appreciate the baffling nature of the alien intelligence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60915031c2bfd9897101b581fdd0fa4ca527a734","amp;dn":"Solaris+1972+Solyaris+720p+with+English+Hardsubs+for+Chromecast","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60915031c2bfd9897101b581fdd0fa4ca527a734","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,145,80,49,194,191,217,137,113,1,181,129,253,208,250,76,165,39,167,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
