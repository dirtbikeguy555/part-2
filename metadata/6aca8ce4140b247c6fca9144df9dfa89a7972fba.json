Over the last few years boxing and kickboxing have become popular forms of fitness training in North America for those looking to progress beyond the Tae-Bo, aerobic-kickboxing and boxercise type format. This book details how to get a calorie burning cardiovascular &amp; resistance workout combined with learning valuable self-defense skills. The routine is also a dynamite way to build self-confidence, agility, coordination, stamina and relieve stress.\n\nComplete with a wide variety of topical information on both general and specific components of fitness, it is professionally detailed with over 300 photographs depicting every punch and kick technique combination. From the warm-up, strength exercises, abs routine and cool down stretches it is designed to ensure safety and efficiency in planning your fitness regiment.\n\nThe exercises are fully explained, and sample workouts are provided allowing you to determine the intensity of your workout based on your fitness and skill level. Tailored to your goals, it makes an ideal, fresh, innovative and personalized workout. The training can be structured into 2 or 3 minute rounds with 30-60 second rests to replicate actual boxing &amp; kickboxing rounds. Concentrating on the various challenging and stress relieving kick &amp; punch combinations enhances mental focus and discipline. It can also be implemented as the warm-up or cardio portion of your regular routine or as an additional alternate session format tailored to your goals and needs. All the equipment required, like boxing gloves, heavy bags and focus pads are portable and the initial expenditure is fairly modest compared to some elaborate home gyms. The additional strength and resistance exercises incorporating the stability ball, medicine ball, resistance tubing and free body exercises keeps the program unique, easy to modify and can be taken with you when traveling or at work.\n\nSo grab your wraps and gloves and &quot;get ready to rumble&quot; your way to fitness.\n\n\n\nBy Ross O'Donnell\nPublished by Trafford Publishing in 2006\nEPUB, Retail, 112 pages, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6aca8ce4140b247c6fca9144df9dfa89a7972fba","amp;dn":"The+Ultimate+Fitness+Boxing%2CKickboxing+Workout%28ePUB%2CRetail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6aca8ce4140b247c6fca9144df9dfa89a7972fba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,202,140,228,20,11,36,124,111,202,145,68,223,157,250,137,167,151,47,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
