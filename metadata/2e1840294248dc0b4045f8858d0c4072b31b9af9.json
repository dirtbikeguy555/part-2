If you already have a backup image on another drive, you can restore from it now.\n\nINSTALLING FRESH COPY OF WINDOWS 8.1 Instructions:\n\nNow that you have your lenovo partitions all set up, its time to install Win8.1.\n\nI tried using an older Windows 8.1 copy I had but it kept erroring out during install  with error 0000005. If you get that error, it most likely means your source disk is bad or your hardware is bad.\n\nI downloaded a more recent copy by MURPHY78 (http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10567314/Windows_8.1_AIO_24in1_with_Update_x64_en-US_Jul2014) and it installed perfectly.\n\nWhen installing windows, chose the partition Windows8_OS.\n\nWhen done, google your lenovo model drivers. Make sure you install One-key-recovery software/drivers. When you are done installing all your drivers and software, run the One-key-recovery program and make a system backup. \n\nOPTIONAL: When done backing up, its important for you to make an offline backup copy of your newly created backup.\nD:LenovoOneKeyAppOneKey Recovery\n- Just back up the whole folder (compress and copy to backup hard-drive)\n- You will need to enable 'show hidden files' in order to access folder.\nWith that backed up, you can do what you want with your laptop and then just boot up the ORK Iso and point it at your external HD backed up recovery folder.\n\nHelpful links:\n\nLenovo Drivers -  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://support.lenovo.com/en_US/downloads/default.page?#&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://support.lenovo.com/en_US/downloads/default.page?#&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLenovo One Key Recovery (OKR) 8.0 ISO and Download and Setup Guide &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://plus.evozi.com/143/lenovo-one-key-recovery-okr-8-0-iso-and-download-and-setup-guide/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://plus.evozi.com/143/lenovo-one-key-recovery-okr-8-0-iso-and-download-and-setup-guide/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nClean Install on Preinstalled UEFI Lenovo Laptop &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.eightforums.com/installation-setup/42780-clean-install-preinstalled-uefi-lenovo-laptop.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.eightforums.com/installation-setup/42780-clean-install-preinstalled-uefi-lenovo-laptop.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forums.lenovo.com/t5/IdeaPad-Y-U-V-Z-and-P-series/Replace-HDD-with-SSD-Y500/td-p/1035281/page/3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forums.lenovo.com/t5/IdeaPad-Y-U-V-Z-and-P-series/Replace-HDD-with-SSD-Y500/td-p/1035281/page/3&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nNote: To change OKR language from English:\n\nAfter burning to USB, open with notepad:\n\nokr8LRS_ESPOneKeyMAINLRS-Config-Org.xml\nand\nokr8LRS_ESPOneKeyMAINLRS-Config.xml\n\nChange en-us to your language code and save.\n\n I created this torrent after a week of troubleshooting my Yoga 2 11 - I hope you find it helpful. I will try to respond to questions. Good luck.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e1840294248dc0b4045f8858d0c4072b31b9af9","amp;dn":"Lenovo+OKR8+One+Key+Recovery+8+Engineer+ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e1840294248dc0b4045f8858d0c4072b31b9af9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,24,64,41,66,72,220,11,64,69,248,133,141,12,64,114,179,27,154,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
