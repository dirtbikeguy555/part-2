The production by Dr. Dre and DJ Yella was deemed dense and funky by critic Jason Birchmeier.[1] The pieces were written primarily by MC Ren, Ice Cube, and The D.O.C.. The album's title track features Eazy rapping about himself and things that he does. &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot; and &quot;No More ?'s&quot; are about life in Compton, California and the gangsta lifestyle.\n\nTracklist:\n1.
