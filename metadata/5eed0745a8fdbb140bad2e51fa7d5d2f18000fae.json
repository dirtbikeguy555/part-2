It was also due to their rural isolation, drug abuse, police harassment and a general escalation in violent lifestyle and environment that this style developed and also spilled over into their live performances and personalities.\nYet despite these self-destructive tendencies (including poorly explained injuries, arrests, court appearances, the infamous debauched and demented US tours, alcoholism and the inevitable acrimonious and public line-up shuffles) and a perceived paranoiac media/industry unfriendly attitude, the band and their sound has risen to dominate and define the doom metal, stoner and sludge metal music scenes. They are now commonly referred to as 'the heaviest band in the world' with at least, three of their seven LPs widely recognised as genre benchmarks and heavy metal classics(1996's 'come my fanaticsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦', 2000's 'dopethrone' and 2007's 'witchcult today'.

The time would be easy to know, for then mankind would have become as the Great Old Ones; free and wild and beyond good and evil, with laws and morals thrown aside and all men shouting and killing and revelling in joy. Then the liberated Old Ones would teach them new ways to shout and kill and revel and enjoy themselves, and all the earth would flame with a holocaust of ecstasy and freedom. Meanwhile the cult, by appropriate rites, must keep alive the memory of those ancient ways and shadow forth the prophecy of their return.&quot; HPL\n\n&quot;We demand total freedom for everybody! And we will not be stopped until we get it. We are bad. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only two kinds of people on the planet: those who make up the problem and those who make up the solution. WE ARE THE SOLUTION. We have no problems. Everything is free for everybody. Money sucks. Leaders suck. School sucksÃ¢â‚¬Â¦..We donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want it! Our program of rock and roll, dope and fucking in the streets is a program of total freedom for everyone. We are totally committed to carrying out our program. We breathe revolution.
