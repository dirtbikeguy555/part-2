The file is a large download and can be applied to any version of Windows XP Home, Professional, TabletPC or Media Center (32 bit only). In addition, it doesn't matter what XP patches you have previously applied to your system, SP3 will update any unpatched, partially patched or completely updated system to version SP3. It includes all features of Service Pack 1 and 2, plus all patches, updates and fixes released up to and including April 2008's monthly security bulletin. Keep in mind that new patches made available after Service Pack 3 was released (mid April 2008) will still need to be applied.\n\nThe advantage of this full download is that it can be used on any system - plus it doesn't require an Internet connection to install. You can download SP3, copy it to disc or a portable drive and use it on multiple PCs. Alternatively, since the file is so huge, you can download SP3 on a fast Internet connection and use it to update a PC with a slow or non-existent connection.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:decc27c186ba22a984c44b05bbc93f16820d98a9","amp;dn":"Windows+XP+Service+Pack+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"decc27c186ba22a984c44b05bbc93f16820d98a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,204,39,193,134,186,34,169,132,196,75,5,187,201,63,22,130,13,152,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
