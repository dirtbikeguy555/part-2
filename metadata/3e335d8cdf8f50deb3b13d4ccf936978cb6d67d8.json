Contrary to popular belief, math requires creative, as well as analytical, thinking. Most people think that thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only one way to do a problem, when in actuality, there are often a number of different solutionsÃ¢â‚¬â€you just need the creativity to see them. For example, there are more than three hundred different known proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem. In short, studying a problem in a laser-focused way until you reach a solution is not an effective way to learn math. Rather, it involves taking the time to step away from a problem and allow the more relaxed and creative part of the brain to take over. A Mind for Numbers shows us that we all have what it takes to excel in math, and learning it is not as painful as some might think!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e335d8cdf8f50deb3b13d4ccf936978cb6d67d8","amp;dn":"A+Mind+For+Numbers%3A+How+to+Excel+at+Math+and+Science+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e335d8cdf8f50deb3b13d4ccf936978cb6d67d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,51,93,140,223,143,80,222,179,177,61,76,207,147,105,120,203,109,103,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
