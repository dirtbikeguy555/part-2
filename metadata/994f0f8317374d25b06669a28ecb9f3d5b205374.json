Published 2010.\nNon-fiction.

But in fact, life is getting betterÃ¢â‚¬â€and at an accelerating rate. Food availability, income, and life span are up; disease, child mortality, and violence are down all across the globe. Africa is following Asia out of poverty; the Internet, the mobile phone, and container shipping are enriching people's lives as never before.\n\nIn his bold and bracing exploration into how human culture evolves positively through exchange and specialization, bestselling author Matt Ridley does more than describe how things are getting better. He explains why. An astute, refreshing, and revelatory work that covers the entire sweep of human historyÃ¢â‚¬â€from the Stone Age to the InternetÃ¢â‚¬â€The Rational Optimist will change your way of thinking about the world for the better.\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\n======================\nIdeas have sex, in Ridley's schema; they follow a process of natural selection of their own, and as long as they continue to do so, there is reason to retire apocalyptic pessimism about the future of our species. Erstwhile zoologist, conservationist, and journalist, Ridley (The Red Queen) posits that as long as civilization engages in exchange and specialization, we will be able to reinvent ourselves and responsibly use earthly resources ad infinitum. Humanity's collective intelligence will save the day, just as it has over the centuries. Ridley puts current perceptions about violence, wealth, and the environment into historical perspective, reaching back thousands of years to advocate global free trade, smaller government, and the use of fossil fuels. He confidently takes on the experts, from modern sociologists who fret over the current level of violence in the world to environmentalists who disdain genetically modified crops. An ambitious and sunny paean to human ingenuity, this is an argument for why ambitious optimism is morally mandatory. \n\nFrom Booklist\n=============\nScience journalist Ridley believes there is a reason to be optimistic about the human race, and he defies the unprecedented economic pessimism he observes. His book is about the rapid and continuous change that human society experiences, unlike any other animal group. Ideas needed to meet and mate for culture to turn cumulative, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“there was a point in human pre-history when big-brained, cultural, learning people for the first time began to exchange things with each other and that once they started doing so, culture suddenly became cumulative, and the great headlong experiment of human economic Ã¢â‚¬ËœprogressÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ began.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Participants in the exchanges improved their lives by trading food and tools. Ridley believes it is probable that humanity will be better off in the next century than it is today, and so will the ecology of our planet. He dares the human race to embrace change, be rationally optimistic, and strive for an improved life for all people. Ã¢â‚¬â€Mary Whaley\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Ridley writes with panache, wit, and humor and displays remarkable ingenuity in finding ways to present complicated materials for the lay reader.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Los Angeles Times","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:994f0f8317374d25b06669a28ecb9f3d5b205374","amp;dn":"The+Rational+Optimist+-+Matt+Ridley+AZW3+EPUB+MOBI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"994f0f8317374d25b06669a28ecb9f3d5b205374","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,79,15,131,23,55,77,37,176,102,105,162,142,203,159,61,91,32,83,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
