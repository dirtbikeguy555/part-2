It was\nintended as an hour-long program to air on BBC 1, but it was deemed\ntoo intense and violent to broadcast. It went to theatrical\ndistribution as a feature film instead. Low-budget and shot on \nlocation, it strives for and achieves convincing and unflinching\nrealism.\n\nPart interviews and quotations, part acting, this film simulates\nthe aftermath of a large-scale nuclear attack near a rural area of\nEngland. It argues that citizens and Civil Defense authorities are\npoorly prepared for this eventuality, and describes possible\nphysical, psychological and social damage in graphic detail.\n\nDespite having been produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation\n(BBC), the film was banned from television broadcast. The official\nreason was for violence and depiction of human suffering, but others\nhinted that it may have been because it went against the official\ngovernment line concerning survivability of nuclear attack. While the\nban forbade television broadcast, it did not forbid cinematic\ndistribution. Because of this loophole, the film was given wide\nrelease in theatres, and won four major film awards.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-=-\n\n\nNote: Seeding using Azureus and RC4 encryption (Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Connection -&gt; Transport Encryption).
