Burakov is aided, covertly at first, by his commanding officer, Col. Mikhail Fetisov and later by Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, a psychiatrist.\n\nAs well as being in the form of a crime thriller, the movie depicts Soviet propaganda and bureaucracy contributing to the failure to capture the killer; his crimes were not widely reported for fear of revealing that such things ever occurred in the USSR.\n\nThe movie was entirely shot in Hungary. The station where Chikatilo picks his victims is the Hatvan railway station, northeast of Hungary. The smaller, arched train shelter scene was shot in Nagymaros. Several other scenes were shot in the GÃƒÂ¶dÃƒÂ¶llo Railway Station. The film was directed by Chris Gerolmo, who also wrote the screenplay adapted from the book The Killer Department by Robert Cullen.\n\nStephen Rea as Viktor Burakov\nDonald Sutherland as Mikhail Fetisov\nJeffrey DeMunn as Andrei Chikatilo\nMax von Sydow as Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky\nJoss Ackland as Bondarchuk\nJohn Wood as Gorbunov\nImelda Staunton as Mrs. Burakov?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d539f59c1301eb22310534d346ffdc39cfeb4b6","amp;dn":"Citizen+X+%5B1995%5D+HBO+Film+About+Soviet+Serial+Killer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d539f59c1301eb22310534d346ffdc39cfeb4b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,83,159,89,193,48,30,178,35,16,83,77,52,111,253,195,156,254,180,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
