She looks like Gwen StefaniÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s long-lost little sister. She shaves the side of her head. Her drumming technique sounds like Meg White after chugging a liter of Fanta. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s romantically linked to Skrillex, which is certainly a life choice that someone could make. Her song Ã¢â‚¬Å“Lights,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ despite being first released during the Paleolithic Era, climbed the Billboard charts this summer and went triple platinum. She performed at William and KateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wedding. She records some great covers.\n\nAll of this is to say that Ellie Goulding is a person it wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hurt to know about. And what better time for Ã¢â‚¬Å“LightsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to hit it big than right before the release of her second album, Halcyon? In a record that the singer herself called Ã¢â‚¬Å“tribalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“anthemic,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Goulding puts on her best Florence Welch face and makes a stab at her very own Ceremonials, and the result is a some gosh darn pretty electropop.\n\nThe heir apparent to the Ã¢â‚¬Å“LightsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ throne is Ã¢â‚¬Å“Anything Can Happen,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a study in vocal layering and self-harmonization. GouldingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dusty soprano gets a good workout throughout as a post-produced instrument, her every chirp cut up and reassembled as a hook. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got some killer lines, too: Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll give you everything you need/But I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think I need you.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The synth-heavy Ã¢â‚¬Å“Only YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ recalls Passion Pit and features more vocal trickery, while the excellent Ã¢â‚¬Å“JOYÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ gives GouldingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s canary-like presence an excellent showcase in a heavenly hymn.\n\nHowever, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a dark edge cutting through Halcyon, first apparent in Ã¢â‚¬Å“My Blood,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with a shamanistic, Eurythmics feel. The title track is heart-tugger (Ã¢â‚¬Å“I knew you were a fighter, but you never fought for meÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) with some welcome guitar, and on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hanging On,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ we get to hear Goulding the Ghost, as her haunted heartache stings like frostbite, arrayed in tinkling strings and spooky backing vocals. At the end, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Know You CareÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ introduces GoudlingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s balladeering prowess. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s affecting.\n\nThe big winner on Halcyon, for my money, is Ã¢â‚¬Å“Figure 8.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The song is high stakes from top to bottom, with a nerve-wracking sense of danger, some light dubstep and a big buildup. You can tell it would be amazing live. In fact, the entirety of Halcyon flows together so well, even in itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s less flashy moments, that it would make a great set list as-is. Make it happen, Ellie. Maybe for the 2032 farewell tour?\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8d38a53b368eb0b1d5b4f6982e5eb08192a0ecb","amp;dn":"Ellie+Goulding+-+Halcyon+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8d38a53b368eb0b1d5b4f6982e5eb08192a0ecb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,211,138,83,179,104,235,11,29,91,79,105,130,229,235,8,25,42,14,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
