In this comprehensive guide, Phil Metzger demystifies perspective, presenting it simply as a matter of mimicking the way we see--like the way a distant mountain appears blue, or a road seems to narrow in the distance.\n\nThe Art of Perspective offers simple but powerful techniques for achieving a convincing illusion of depth and distance, whether it's a few inches in a still life or miles in a landscape.\n\n*Start simple, with atmospheric perspective and intuitive techniques, and gradually progress to linear perspective and more complex challenges such as stairways, curves and reflections.\n\n*Use the engaging, step-by-step demonstrations and exercises to try out each essential concept for yourself, making lessons clearer and more memorable.\n\n*Learn theories that apply to all mediums, with specific advice for achieving effects using acrylic, oil, watercolor and pencil.\n\n*Get the inside scoop on professional tricks and shortcuts that make perspective easier than ever!\n\nForget everything you think you know (or don't know) about perspective. This book builds an easy-to-follow, ground-up understanding of how to turn a flat painting or drawing surface into a living, breathing, dimensional scene that lures viewers in. No matter how you look at it, it's the ultimate guide to perspective for artists of every medium and skill level.\n\nThe Art of Perspective - (June 12, 2007)\nBook Language: English \nPages: 211\nFile Type: Pdf\nFile Size: 103.87 MB\n\nISBN-10: 1581808550\nISBN-13: 978-1581808551\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/rqc4ZHW.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/rqc4ZHW.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ad02f2e881dca5a61f3ba7189cc399265c0bd3c","amp;dn":"The+Art+of+Perspective+-+The+Ultimate+Guide+for+Artists+in+Every","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ad02f2e881dca5a61f3ba7189cc399265c0bd3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,208,47,46,136,29,202,90,97,243,186,113,137,204,57,146,101,192,189,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
