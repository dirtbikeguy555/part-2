With its larger-than-normal image sensor, superior image quality, and impressive array of features for creative photography, this camera has attracted a large and dedicated following in the photography community. However, the camera does not come with a printed manual, or even a PDF manual that can readily be printed for reference. So, until now, it has been difficult for users of the camera to find answers to their questions about the use of the camera's many controls, menus, and features. With the release of this new book, White Knight Press has provided users of the RX100 with a comprehensive guide to all operations, features, menus, and controls of this amazing camera.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a995f99a57c2e40e679a114e5472855d9910578","amp;dn":"Photographer%27s+Guide+to+the+Sony+DSC-RX100","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a995f99a57c2e40e679a114e5472855d9910578","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,153,95,153,165,124,46,64,230,121,161,20,229,71,40,85,217,145,5,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
