Recorded entirely in Vai's Mothership home studio, Passion and Warfare represents Steve Vai as a melodic, heavy guitarist with a gift for remarkable composition and a deep desire to convey the mystical and the metaphysical through his every last note. The result was nothing short of stellar. The album was championed by critics: Guitar Player and Guitar World named it the best album of 1990, and both magazines showered him with individual awards; Guitar Player awarded Vai the titles of Best Rock Guitarist for the fi fth year in a row and Best Overall Guitarist for the third year in a row, while Guitar World named him Best Rock Guitarist and deemed &quot;For the Love of God&quot; the year's best guitar solo. For this anniversary release, the album was newly remastered from the original analog tapes, and includes four newly discovered recordings from the album sessions!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n01 - Liberty\r\n02 - Erotic Nightmares\r\n03 - The Animal\r\n04 - Answers\r\n05 - The Riddle\r\n06 - Ballerina 12/24\r\n07 - For the Love of God\r\n08 - The Audience Is Listening\r\n09 - I Would Love To\r\n10 - Blue Powder\r\n11 - Greasy Kid's Stuff (Mixed Twelve)\r\n12 - Alien Water Kiss\r\n13 - Sisters\r\n14 - Love Secrets\r\n15 - Lovely Elixir [Bonus Track]\r\n16 - And We Are One [Bonus Track]\r\n17 - As Above [Bonus Track]\r\n18 - So Below [Bonus Track]\r\n\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/wiCW","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdebeaa27a065c3156f2dd8d18d90c667a8651da","amp;dn":"Steve+Vai+-+Passion+And+Warfare+%281990%29+%5B25th%5D+%282016%29+%5B24-192%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdebeaa27a065c3156f2dd8d18d90c667a8651da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,235,234,162,122,6,92,49,86,242,221,141,24,217,12,102,122,134,81,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
