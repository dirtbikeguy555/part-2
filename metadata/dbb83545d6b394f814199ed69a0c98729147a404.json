But modern technology along with the recent artisanal renaissance has opened up the diverse, time-honored, and dynamic world of cheese to enthusiasts willing to take its humble fundamentalsÃ¢â‚¬â€milk, starters, coagulants, and saltÃ¢â‚¬â€and transform them into complex edibles.\n\nArtisan Cheese Making at Home is the most ambitious and comprehensive guide to home cheese making, filled with easy-to-follow instructions for making mouthwatering cheese and dairy items. Renowned cooking instructor Mary Karlin has spent years working alongside the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most passionate artisan cheese producersÃ¢â‚¬â€cooking, creating, and learning the nuances of their trade. She presents her findings in this lavishly illustrated guide, which features more than eighty recipes for a diverse range of cheeses: from quick and satisfying Mascarpone and Queso Blanco to cultured products like CrÃƒÂ¨me FraÃƒÂ®che and Yogurt to flavorful selections like Saffron-Infused Manchego, Irish-Style Cheddar, and Bloomy Blue Log ChÃƒÂ¨vre.\n\nArtisan Cheese Making at Home begins with a primer covering milks, starters, cultures, natural coagulants, and bacteriaÃ¢â‚¬â€everything the beginner needs to get started. The heart of the book is a master class in home cheese making: building basic skills with fresh cheeses like ricotta and working up to developing and aging complex mold-ripened cheeses. Also covered are techniques and equipment, including drying, pressing, and brining, as well as molds and ripening boxes. Last but not least, there is a full chapter on cooking with cheese that includes more than twenty globally-influenced recipes featuring the finished cheeses, such as Goat Cheese and Chive Fallen SoufflÃƒÂ©s with Herb-Citrus Vinaigrette and Blue Cheese, Bacon, and Pear Galette.\n\nOffering an approachable exploration of the alchemy of this extraordinary food, Artisan Cheese Making at Home proves that hand-crafting cheese is not only achievable, but also a fascinating and rewarding process.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbb83545d6b394f814199ed69a0c98729147a404","amp;dn":"Artisan+Cheese+Making+at+Home%3A+Techniques+and+Recipes+for+Master","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbb83545d6b394f814199ed69a0c98729147a404","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,184,53,69,214,179,148,248,20,25,158,214,154,12,152,114,145,71,164,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
