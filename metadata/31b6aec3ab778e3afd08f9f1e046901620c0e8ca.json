Starting with simple client-server socket programs and progressing to complex design and implementation of TCP/IP protocol in linux, this book provides different aspects of socket programming and major TCP/IP related algorithms. In addition, the text features netfilter hook framework, a complete explanation of routing sub-system, IP QOS implementation, and Network Soft IRQ. This book further contains elements on TCP state machine implementation,TCP timer implementation on Linux, TCP memory management on Linux, and debugging TCP/IP stack using lcrash.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31b6aec3ab778e3afd08f9f1e046901620c0e8ca","amp;dn":"TCP%2FIP+Architecture%2C+Design+and+Implementation+in+Linux+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31b6aec3ab778e3afd08f9f1e046901620c0e8ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,182,174,195,171,119,142,58,253,8,249,241,224,70,144,22,32,192,232,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
