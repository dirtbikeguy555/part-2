Koda and Kenai team up, but are\nhunted by Kenai's other brother, Denahi, who fears that the bear has killed\nKenai as well. Along the way, the two bears meet other friends, including\ntwo moose, some rams, and some mammoths, with whom they hitch a ride.\nHowever, Kenai discovers that he likes being a bear, and realizes that\nhumans aren't only afraid of bears; through Koda's eyes, the humans are\nthe monsters, with their long spears.

Kenai dreams of Nita, a girl he had met and saved when he\nwas very young. After giving her an amulet, and promising they'd be friends\nforever, Nita leaves for her home and Kenai never sees her again. We then\nsee Nita, now grown up, beautiful and preparing her her wedding. However,\nthe ancestors are not pleased, as Nita is already tied to Kenai. The only\nway for Nita to break their bond and be happily married is to journey to\nthe very place where Kenai gave her the amulet and burn it together. As\nKenai, Nita and Koda journey to the place together, Koda cannot help but\nfeel worried that Kenai might abandon him altogether for Nita.
