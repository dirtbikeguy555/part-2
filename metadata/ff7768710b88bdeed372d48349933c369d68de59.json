Using songs, sermons, narratives, and letters of the period, he reveals how the success of the First Crusade inspired generations of kings to campaign for their own vainglory and set down a marker for the knights of Europe, men who increasingly blurred the boundaries between chivalry and crusading. In the Muslim world, early attempts to call a jihad fell upon deaf ears until the charisma of the Sultan Saladin brought the struggle to a climax. Yet the story that emerges has other dimensionsâ€”as never before, Phillips incorporates the holy wars within the story of medieval Christendom and Islam and shines new light on many truces, alliances, and diplomatic efforts that have been forgotten over the centuries.\r\n\r\nHoly Warriors also discusses how the term â€œcrusadeâ€ survived into the modern era and how its redefinition through romantic literature and the drive for colonial empires during the nineteenth century gave it an energy and a resonance that persisted down to the alliance between Franco and the Church during the Spanish Civil War and right up to George W. Bushâ€™s pious â€œwar on terror.â€\r\n\r\nElegantly written, compulsively readable, and full of stunning new portraits of unforgettable real-life figuresâ€”from Richard the Lionhearted to Melisende, the formidable crusader queen of Jerusalemâ€”Holy Warriors is a must-read for anyone interested in medieval Europe, as well as for those seeking to understand the history of religious conflict","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff7768710b88bdeed372d48349933c369d68de59","amp;dn":"Holy+Warriors%3A+A+Modern+History+of+the+Crusades","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff7768710b88bdeed372d48349933c369d68de59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,119,104,113,11,136,189,238,211,114,212,131,73,147,60,54,157,104,222,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
