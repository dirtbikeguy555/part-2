INSIDE THE KREMLIN, recorded in a Moscow in the throes of glasnost in 1988, features pieces that are simultaneously awe-inspiring and hypnotic. The more lighthearted tracks culled from TANA MANA include Shankar's good friend the late George Harrison among several other rock luminaries, while modern classical composer Philip Glass is a collaborator on the selections taken from PASSAGES\n\nReviews:\nI think this is one of the best of the project of the ravi shankar. this sounds more jazz -rock fusion and it gives more sense of indianism. I think one should really pick this album who wanted to hear the sense of being oneself\nSubmitted by sainath (india)\n\nThis album is the best among many created by Pt Ravi Shankar. I know it may sound Greek to Western ears, however a basic understanding of Indian music will help in understanding this music.\nSubmitted by Alok (Greenfield, IN, USA)\n\n-------- Tracks -------\n1.
