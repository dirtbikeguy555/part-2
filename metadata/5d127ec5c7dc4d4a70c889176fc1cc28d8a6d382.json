Natasha Turner, ND, returns with a revolutionary follow-up to her phenomenal first book, The Hormone Diet, in which she teaches readers the ins and outs of how and why their hormones play the biggest part in their weight-loss woes. Now, in The Supercharged Hormone Diet, she gives readers the information they need to get their hormones back on trackÃ¢â‚¬â€in 30 days flat.\n\nIn this busy, fast-paced world, we don't always have time to research the science behind our diets. We want to lose weight sooner and faster. Dr. Turner has created an accelerated hormone diet with the same basic principles as the original (eating the right foods to correct hormonal imbalances), and she's plucked out the most important information from The Hormone Diet. This supercharged plan includes questionnaires and assessments to get readers started, a higher-protein detox than the original, key tips for sleep and exercise, a handy food list, a new 2-week meal plan, a chart to help readers stay on top of their goals, and many new hormone-diet-friendly recipes.\n\nThe Supercharged Hormone Diet gives readers exactly what they needÃ¢â‚¬â€a quick-start plan with a 30-day time frame.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d127ec5c7dc4d4a70c889176fc1cc28d8a6d382","amp;dn":"The+Supercharged+Hormone+Diet+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d127ec5c7dc4d4a70c889176fc1cc28d8a6d382","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,18,126,197,199,220,77,74,112,200,137,23,111,193,204,40,216,166,211,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
