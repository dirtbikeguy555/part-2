I bought the CD and thought I would share it.  If you like it, try to buy some of this guys stuff.\n\n&quot;PAST IS PROLOGUE&quot; - CD \n\n    * ELECTRONICA\n    * label: MERCK\n    * 02/11/2006\n\n\nMerck do it again with a simply luscious and very pure sounding CD of electronic purism. Yes, you could say that it&amp;#039;s a bit Boards-esque, but, quite frankly, who gives a damn when it&amp;#039;s this good? Not me, that&amp;#039;s for sure. Deep, melodic tracks with acres of atmosphere and divine sound design that kept me listening and feeling the love all the way through. And on an absolutely blinking freezing cold day like today it&amp;#039;s good to have something to warm my cockles - apart from the lovely Simon of course... A recommended album, oh yes. And while you&amp;#039;re at it, you might want to check the other new Merck bits... marvellous!\n\n\nTycho - Past is Prologue - 01 - From Home.mp3\n\nTycho - Past is Prologue - 02 - Sunrise Projector.mp3\n\nTycho - Past is Prologue - 03 - Dictaphone&amp;#039;s Lament.mp3\n\nTycho - Past is Prologue - 04 - PBS.mp3\n\nTycho - Past is Prologue - 05 - Send And Receive.mp3\n\nTycho - Past is Prologue - 06 - Brother.mp3\n\nTycho - Past is Prologue - 07 - A Circular Reeducation.mp3\n\nTycho - Past is Prologue - 08 - Past Is Prologue.mp3\n\nTycho - Past is Prologue - 09 - Cloud Generator.mp3\n\nTycho - Past is Prologue - 10 - The Disconnect.mp3\n\nTycho - Past is Prologue - 11 - A Circular Reeducation - Dusty Brown Remix.mp3\n\nTycho - Past is Prologue - 12 - Send And Receive - Chachi Jones Remix.mp3\n\nTycho - Past is Prologue - 13 - Sunrise Projector - Nautilis Remix.mp3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a73faf80d34b4f2f9153dc18feb6c9105a3acca","amp;dn":"Tycho+-+Past+is+Prologue+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a73faf80d34b4f2f9153dc18feb6c9105a3acca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,115,250,248,13,52,180,242,249,21,61,193,143,235,108,145,5,163,172,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
