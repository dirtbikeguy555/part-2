Its speciality is a limitless spectrum of unusual, evolving sounds created using the powerful, hybrid synthesis architecture and sophisticated modulation and effect system - resulting in sounds far removed from the everyday. What's more ABSYNTH 5 is not just a synthesizer, but a powerful effect plug-in for treating audio tracks using the unique ABSYNTH 5 effects bank.\n\nONE-CLICK SOUND DESIGN\n\nVersion 5 sees ABSYNTH make creative sound design simpler than ever before. With the innovative Sound Mutator it's now possible to create completely new sounds by combining the characteristics of other sounds, generated without delving into the depths of the synthesis architecture. ABSYNTH 5 also contains new and unusual effects and filters such as the Aetherizer, Cloud Filter and Supercomb, as well as 250 new presets that explore previously uncharted regions of sound.\n\n2,100 FIRST CLASS SOUNDS\n\nFull of endlessly expressive sounds, ABSYNTH 5 hosts a collection of 2,100 sounds ranging from classic keyboard sounds to complex grooves, abstract soundscapes and endlessly transforming sonic landscapes.\n\nTHE ARCHITECTURE OF SOUND\n\nABSYNTH 5 is unrivalled as a tool for creating unique sounds. The hybrid architecture features three oscillator channels and a semimodular signal flow combined with diverse sound generating methods such as subtractive synthesis, FM, wave-table, granular sampling, and sampling with wave-morphing, filters, modulators and effects. In addition, a uniquely flexible envelope control with 68-stage envelopes allows for sounds to be subtly or radically animated. From softly undulating pads to aggressive rhythmic synth attacks - everything is possible with ABSYNTH 5.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNothing Special.\n\n1.Install the update.\n2.Copy our cracks.\n3.Give a specific permission to the *.app.\n4.Enjoy!\n\nTEAM R2R 2014\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur greets go to all hard working groups.\nAnd middle finger to the people who make money with our effort.\n\nSupport the good developer if you like it.\nWe would like to support you for free as long as you understand\nwhat you are doing and what it means.\n\nREVERSE 2 REVOLUTiONiZE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ndemonoid.ph - 1337x.to - flashtorrents.org - fenopy.se\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXIV (10).\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77e0487fcba3d6ddc66331519d4c202c88234aa3","amp;dn":"Native+Instruments+-+Absynth+5+v5.2.1+UPDATE+OS+X+%5BR2R%5D%5Bdada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77e0487fcba3d6ddc66331519d4c202c88234aa3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,224,72,127,203,163,214,221,198,99,49,81,157,76,32,44,136,35,74,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
