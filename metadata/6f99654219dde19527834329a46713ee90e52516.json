And to prove his conviction that it's a passion for food and not formal academic qualifications that makes a good cook, he's training fifteen unemployed youngsters to work as chefs in the kitchen. All within seven months... And he's picked a busy year. He's writing a new book, has business trips to juggle, a host of other commitments and most importantly of all, he's about to become a dad. He's taking a huge risk, and regardless of whether the trainees can handle it, can Jamie? Or has he bitten off more than he can chew? This DVD features the original five part series first broadcast on Channel 4 plus the two follow-up episodes that catch up with Jamie and his trainees six months later.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f99654219dde19527834329a46713ee90e52516","amp;dn":"Jamie.Oliver.Jamies.Kitchen.S01.DVDRip.XviD-NOsegmenT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f99654219dde19527834329a46713ee90e52516","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,153,101,66,25,221,225,149,39,131,67,41,164,103,19,238,144,229,37,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
