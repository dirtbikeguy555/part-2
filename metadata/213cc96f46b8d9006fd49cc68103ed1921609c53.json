Projects\nare designed to interact with the real world using\nScratch which helps one easily receive inputs from\nmany sensors. This course is primarily targeted at\nlearners who wish to explore Arduino and learn about\nmicrocontrollers. This course requires one to have basic\nknowledge in electronics of concepts like voltage, current and\nresistance\n\nThe course taker also needs to download and install the\nsoftware on their computer and they are good to go. No prior\nknowledge of programming or coding is required however basic\nknowledge about the same is a bonus!\n\nThe course is structured as a series of interesting\nreal time projects, through which you can learn\nhow to use the software interface to make Projects\nof your own. Arduino can be used to change\nsurroundings by controlling lights, motors, and a\nnumber of other accessories. It's intended for\nanyone looking to make interactive hardware\nprojects","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:213cc96f46b8d9006fd49cc68103ed1921609c53","amp;dn":"UDEMY+MASTER+ARDUINO+WITHOUT+CODING+TUTORIAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"213cc96f46b8d9006fd49cc68103ed1921609c53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,60,201,111,70,184,217,0,111,212,156,198,129,3,237,25,33,96,156,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
