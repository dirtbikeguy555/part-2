Well over 30 TB of raw material from these sessions alone.\n\nThe London Ensembles sessions feature the cream of Hans Zimmer's hand picked percussion corps playing a distillation of a decade's worth of musical experimentation and innovation. This is not an imitation of techniques explored in films including Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, The Dark Knight and Inception. It is a truthful recreation.\n\nKONTAKT 5.3\n\n\nInstall guide:\n\n- Open your latest Kontakt\n- Go to Libraries tab\n- Click add library\n- Select the directory/folder that you downloaded Albion at.\n- On Win user, just Yes or Accept when prompted to add libary.\n- Mac user, read www.native-instruments.com/en/support/knowledge-base/show/794/\n(Except WITHOUT the key or serial part!)\n- The added library will show up on the left panel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cae6de2a1b3345c614e368c6227528435a03159","amp;dn":"Spitfire+Audio+-+Hans+Zimmer+Percussion+London+Ensembles+HZ01","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cae6de2a1b3345c614e368c6227528435a03159","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,174,109,226,161,179,52,92,97,78,54,140,98,39,82,132,53,160,49,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
