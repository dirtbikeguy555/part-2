At thirteen, he led a band of bloodthirsty thugs. By fifteen, he intends to be king...\n\nIt's time for Prince Honorous Jorg Ancrath to return to the castle he turned his back on, to take what's rightfully his. Since the day he hung pinned on the thorns of a briar patch and watched Count Renar's men slaughter his mother and young brother, Jorg has been driven to vent his rage. Life and death are no more than a game to him--and he has nothing left to lose. But treachery awaits him in his father's castle. Treachery and dark magic. No matter how fierce his will, can one young man conquer enemies with power beyond his imagining ?\n\n\nKing of Thorns (The Broken Empire #2)\n\nThe second book in the Broken Empire series, Lawrence takes his young anti-hero one step closer to his grand ambition.\n\nTo reach greatness you must step on bodies, and many brothers lie trodden in my wake. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve walked from pawn to player and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll win this game of ours, though the cost of it may drown the world in bloodÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nThe land burns with the fires of a hundred battles as lords and petty kings fight for the Broken Empire. The long road to avenge the slaughter of his mother and brother has shown Prince Honorous Jorg Ancrath the hidden hands behind this endless war. He saw the game and vowed to sweep the board. First though he must gather his own pieces, learn the rules of play, and discover how to break them.\n\nA six nation army, twenty thousand strong, marches toward Jorg's gates, led by a champion beloved of the people. Every decent man prays this shining hero will unite the empire and heal its wounds. Every omen says he will. Every good king knows to bend the knee in the face of overwhelming odds, if only to save their people and their lands. But King Jorg is not a good king.\n\nFaced by an enemy many times his strength Jorg knows that he cannot win a fair fight. But playing fair was never part of JorgÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s game plan.\n\n\nEmperor of Thorns (The Broken Empire #3)\n\nTo reach the throne requires that a man journey. Even a path paved with good intentions can lead to hell, and my intentions were never good.\n\nThe Hundred converge for Congression to politic upon the corpse of Empire, and while they talk the Dead King makes his move, and I make mine. The world is cracked, time has run through, leaving us clutching at the end days, the future so bright that those who see it are the first to burn. These are the days that have waited for us all our lives. These are my days. I will stand before the Hundred and they will listen. I will take the throne whoever seeks to thwart me, living or dead, and if I must be the last emperor then I will make of it such an ending.\n\nThis is where the wise man turns away. This is where the holy kneel and call on God. These are the last miles, my brothers. Don't look to me to save you. Don't think I will not spend you. Run if you have the wit. Pray if you have the soul. Stand your ground if courage is yours. But don't follow me.\n\nFollow me, and I will break your heart.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9f3431a9b8adaf8626d9191d266c84d40d49ebd","amp;dn":"The+Broken+Empire+Omnibus+Edition+-+Mark+Lawrence","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9f3431a9b8adaf8626d9191d266c84d40d49ebd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,243,67,26,155,138,218,248,98,109,145,145,210,102,200,77,64,212,158,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
