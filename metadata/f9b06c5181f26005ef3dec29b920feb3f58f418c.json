protruding from surfaces where actual responses were collected.\n\n    Row(s) in the design layout are highlighted when point(s) are selected on the diagnostics: The highlighting feature makes identification of problematic data much easier.\n\n    Numerical optimization solutions are now carried over to graphical optimization and point prediction: Explore the results of the numerical optimization on other screens. \n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSharing is Caring\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nQuestions and Feedback are WELCOME\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you like the upload, take a second to say 'Thanks'\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9b06c5181f26005ef3dec29b920feb3f58f418c","amp;dn":"Stat-Ease+Design+Expert+v7.0.0+%28SaMeep104%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9b06c5181f26005ef3dec29b920feb3f58f418c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,176,108,81,129,242,96,5,239,61,236,41,185,32,254,179,245,143,65,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
