Today, many people are surprised to hear that the Pentagon was ever a target--let alone learn about the loss of life that occurred there. And even fewer know about those who escaped, many terrifyingly close to the impact zone. \r\nWitness survivors telling their stories, many for the first time. Watch as first responders recount their battle with a jet-fueled inferno that came dangerously close to shutting down the National Military Command Center (NMCC), the country's nerve center for military operations. Hear from aviation professionals, who provide a bigger picture of the attacks across the eastern seaboard, and shed light on events at the Pentagon before, during and after the attack. \r\nThis is the most complete telling of what happened at the Pentagon on a day that forever changed our world.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9f/9.11-Inside-the-Pentagon-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/64/9.11-Inside-the-Pentagon-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6e/9.11-Inside-the-Pentagon-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3a/9.11-Inside-the-Pentagon-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/11/9.11-Inside-the-Pentagon-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/33/9.11-Inside-the-Pentagon-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5c/9.11-Inside-the-Pentagon-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/30/9.11-Inside-the-Pentagon-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4e/9.11-Inside-the-Pentagon-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/01/9.11-Inside-the-Pentagon-Screen9.jpg \r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video: Bitrate: CRF-22 (~2837 Kbps)\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 55 mins,\r\n * Framerate: 29.412 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.13 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.pbs.org/program/911-inside-pentagon/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78c8fde9db028210629cb15360058e6bbe48fd08","amp;dn":"9+11+Inside+the+Pentagon+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78c8fde9db028210629cb15360058e6bbe48fd08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,200,253,233,219,2,130,16,98,156,177,83,96,5,142,107,190,72,253,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
