Compelling, passionate, haunting, brilliant: these are the words that have been used to describe the work of award-winning #1 New York Times bestselling author Daniel Silva.\n\nSilva burst onto the scene in 1997 with his electrifying bestselling debut, The Unlikely Spy, a novel of love and deception set around the Allied invasion of France in World War II. His second and third novels, The Mark of the Assassin and The Marching Season, were also instant New York Times bestsellers and starred two of SilvaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most memorable characters: CIA officer Michael Osbourne and international hit man Jean-Paul Delaroche. But it was SilvaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fourth novel, The Kill Artist, which would alter the course of his career. The novel featured a character described as one of the most memorable and compelling in contemporary fiction, the art restorer and sometime Israeli secret agent Gabriel Allon, and though Silva did not realize it at the time, GabrielÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s adventures had only just begun. Gabriel Allon appears in SilvaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s next nine novels, each one more successful than the last: The English Assassin, The Confessor, A Death in Vienna, and Prince of Fire, The Messenger, The Secret Servant, Moscow Rules, The Defector, The Rembrandt Affair, Portrait of a Spy, and The Fallen Angel (July 17, 2012).\n\nChronological Order of his books :\n\nÃ¢â€”Â¾ The Unlikely Spy (World War II standalone spy thriller)\nÃ¢â€”Â¾ The Mark of the Assassin (Michael Osbourne #1)\nÃ¢â€”Â¾ The Marching Season (Michael Osbourne #2)\nÃ¢â€”Â¾ The Kill Artist (Gabriel Allon #1)\nÃ¢â€”Â¾ The English Assassin (Gabriel Allon #2)\nÃ¢â€”Â¾ The Confessor (Gabriel Allon #3)\nÃ¢â€”Â¾ A Death in Vienna (Gabriel Allon #4)\nÃ¢â€”Â¾ Prince of Fire (Gabriel Allon #5)\nÃ¢â€”Â¾ The Messenger (Gabriel Allon #6)\nÃ¢â€”Â¾ The Secret Servant (Gabriel Allon #7)\nÃ¢â€”Â¾ Moscow Rules (Gabriel Allon #8)\nÃ¢â€”Â¾ The Defector (Gabriel Allon #9)\nÃ¢â€”Â¾ The Rembrandt Affair (Gabriel Allon #10)\nÃ¢â€”Â¾ Portrait of a Spy (Gabriel Allon #11)\nÃ¢â€”Â¾ The Fallen Angel (Gabriel Allon #12)\nÃ¢â€”Â¾ The English Girl (Gabriel Allon #13)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d797969a52d51dfdb7cc6d1b037a6f69f756cfd1","amp;dn":"Daniel+Silva+E-Book+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d797969a52d51dfdb7cc6d1b037a6f69f756cfd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,151,150,154,82,213,29,253,183,204,109,27,3,122,111,105,247,86,207,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
