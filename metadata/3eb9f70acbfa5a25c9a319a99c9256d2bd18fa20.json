The engine has to compile all the shaders and materials.\n\nAs always, block the program in your firewall.\n\nEnjoy the new Unreal Engine 4!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3eb9f70acbfa5a25c9a319a99c9256d2bd18fa20","amp;dn":"Unreal+Engine+4+-+Compiled+Build","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3eb9f70acbfa5a25c9a319a99c9256d2bd18fa20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,185,247,10,203,250,90,37,201,163,25,169,156,146,86,210,189,24,250,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
