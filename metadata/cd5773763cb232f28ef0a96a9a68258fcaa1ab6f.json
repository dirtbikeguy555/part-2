I say, how the hell would they know? We made it, didn't we? She became my whole life, didn't she? And as for my folks not being real, being true? Tell that to me aged ten, eleven, twelve Ã¢â‚¬â€ damn, all my bastard life Ã¢â‚¬â€ when I was never enough, when I was beaten until I bled for being too good at football and not being everything they'd dreamed: the perfectly dutiful son. Tell that to thousands of kids around the world getting wailed on by asshole parents for whatever stupid reason; tell them that evil don't exist in their eyes. \n\nFuck Romeo and Juliet: this is the story of me and my girl, from my lips. No mushy sentiment, no cheese, just the plain, hard truth, and, because I'm feeling generous, I'm going to let you in on more of our story too.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd5773763cb232f28ef0a96a9a68258fcaa1ab6f","amp;dn":"Sweet+Rome+%28Sweet+Home+%232%29+by+Tillie+Cole+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd5773763cb232f28ef0a96a9a68258fcaa1ab6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,87,115,118,60,178,50,242,142,240,169,106,154,104,37,143,202,161,171,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
