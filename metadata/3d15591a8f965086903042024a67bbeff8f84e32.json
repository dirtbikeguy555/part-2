So naturally if you made a Mario movie, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d want to abandon everything that people liked and recognized about them, and then just in case people were still willing to give it the benefit of the doubt, throw in The Happening star John Leguizamo.\n\nLetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s say you went to the cinema hoping to see your favorite character from Mario 3, the red carnivorous fish Big Bertha. Ignoring the fact that you are a moron for your favorite character not being the King of Ice World when heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been transformed into a seal, you might be disappointed to to learn that in the movie, Big Bertha is instead a large, violent woman with prodigious cleavage who wears S &amp; M-esque garb. (Or maybe youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re into that. In that case, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re probably not welcome in many of the theaters that were showing Super Mario Bros.)\n\nSo Big Bertha isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a fish, the goombas arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t tiny, stompable, sentient mushrooms, and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nary a Tanooki suit to be found. No big deal, as long as the Mario Brothers are still brothers, right? WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that? For no apparent reason Luigi is the adopted ward of Mario? Well, maybe it could still work as long as the movie isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t an incoherent, hideous mess full of shouting and chaos and cheap sets andÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Why are you shaking your head sadly?\n\nStrap on your KuriboÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shoes and join Mike, Kevin, and Bill up on JugemÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cloud for riffing on the best live action Mario property that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t contain Captain Lou Albano.\n\nScreens &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/0c8YO9s.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/0c8YO9s.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d15591a8f965086903042024a67bbeff8f84e32","amp;dn":"RiffTrax+MKB+-+Super+Mario+Bros..mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d15591a8f965086903042024a67bbeff8f84e32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,21,89,26,143,150,80,134,144,48,66,2,74,103,187,239,248,248,78,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
