Fienberg and Robert E.K. Rourke\nDover Publications Reprint | September 2013 | ISBN-10: 0486492710 | ePUB | 364 pages | 27.8 mb\n\nThis introduction to the world of statistics draws examples from a broad range of applications, including business, government, medicine, social sciences, biology, and everyday life. The first four chapters present a brief course in exploratory data analysis. The authors place special emphasis on methods for collecting data and offer an elementary treatment of multiple regression. A concluding chapter on the design of comparative experiments links the basic ideas of design to previously discussed methods of analysis. Each chapter and section concludes with review problems. Suitable for undergraduate students, the text requires only one year of high school algebra.\nThis authoritative treatment was co-written by Frederick Mosteller, one of the twentieth century's preeminent statisticians and the founding chairman of Harvard's Department of Statistics, and Stephen Fienberg, a leader of statistics departments at the University of Minnesota and Carnegie Mellon University and who is internationally known for innovative statistical research and its application to social science and public policy.\n\nCONTENTS\n1 Frequency Distributions \n2 Summarizing and Comparing Distributions \n3 Finiding and Summarizing Relaitionships \n4 Analysis of One-Way and Two-Way Tables\n5 Gathering Data \n6 Sampling of Attributes \n7 Large Samples, the Normal Approximation, and Drawing Random Samples\n8 Probability\n9 Comparisons for Proportions and Counts \n10 Comparisons for Measurements \n11 Fitting Straight Lines Using Least Squares \n12 The Linear Regression Model and Its Use\n13 Regression with Two Predictors\n14 Multiple Regression\n15 Analysis of Variance\n16 N onparametric Methods\n17 Ideas of Experimentation\nAppendix I Summations and Subscripts\nAppendix II Formulas for Least -Squares Coefficients for Regression with Two Predictors\nAppendix III Tables\nShort Answers to Selected Problems\nIndex to Data Sets and Examples\nGeneral Index","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:945fb0c87c06d17cb5fab89b65536875dd1bd078","amp;dn":"Beginning+Statistics+with+Data+Analysis+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"945fb0c87c06d17cb5fab89b65536875dd1bd078","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,95,176,200,124,6,209,124,181,250,184,155,101,83,104,117,221,27,208,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
