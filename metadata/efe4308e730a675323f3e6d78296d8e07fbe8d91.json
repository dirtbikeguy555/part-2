DavidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s victory was improbable and miraculous. He shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have won.\n\nOr should he have?\n\nIn David and Goliath, Malcolm Gladwell challenges how we think about obstacles and disadvantages, offering a new interpretation of what it means to be discriminated against, or cope with a disability, or lose a parent, or attend a mediocre school, or suffer from any number of other apparent setbacks.\n\nGladwell begins with the real story of what happened between the giant and the shepherd boy those many years ago. From there, David and Goliath examines Northern IrelandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Troubles, the minds of cancer researchers and civil rights leaders, murder and the high costs of revenge, and the dynamics of successful and unsuccessful classroomsÃ¢â‚¬â€all to demonstrate how much of what is beautiful and important in the world arises from what looks like suffering and adversity.\n\nIn the tradition of GladwellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s previous bestsellersÃ¢â‚¬â€The Tipping Point, Blink, Outliers and What the Dog SawÃ¢â‚¬â€David and Goliath draws upon history, psychology, and powerful storytelling to reshape the way we think of the world around us.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:efe4308e730a675323f3e6d78296d8e07fbe8d91","amp;dn":"David+and+Goliath_+Underdogs%2C+Misfits%2C+and+-+Malcolm+Gladwell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"efe4308e730a675323f3e6d78296d8e07fbe8d91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,228,48,142,115,10,103,83,35,243,230,215,130,150,216,224,127,190,141,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
