This outstanding work should be widely read -- it is perhaps the best example of an integrative approach to gerontology.&quot; Score: 94, 4 stars --Doody's\n\nThis sixth edition of a classic multidisciplinary text for students of gerontology continues to offer practical, reader-friendly information about the physical changes and common pathologies associated with the aging process. It places special emphasis on the psychological and social implications of these changes in the lives of older adults. The book is distinguished by its thorough focus on anatomy and physiology and common health problems pertaining to each body system.\n\nThis latest edition has been thoroughly updated to present new research findings that differentiate &quot;normal&quot; aging from actual pathology. It provides new data and guidelines on risk factors, nutrition, preventive measures, interventions, and commonly prescribed medications, and includes expanded treatment of complementary and alternative therapies. The book emphasizes the positive aspects of aging and demonstrates how the elderly population can gain greater personal control, through lifestyle changes and preventative health strategies, toward the goal of optimal aging. The book also includes an updated discussion of grief, ethical issues, and funeral options. Written for students of gerontology, social work, human services, nursing. occupational and physical therapy, counseling, and elder law, it presents information that is clearly understandable for those without an extensive background in biology or medicine. The book reinforces information with practical applications of aging data.\n\nPhysical Change and Aging, Sixth Edition comes with instructor materials, including PowerPoint presentations and test banks for each chapter.
