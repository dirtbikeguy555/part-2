As he would later write in the first \nof a series of award-winning columns for Vanity Fair, he suddenly found \nhimself being deported &quot;from the country of the well across the stark frontier \nthat marks off the land of malady.&quot; Over the next eighteen months, until his \ndeath in Houston on December 15, 2011, he wrote constantly and brilliantly \non politics and culture, astonishing readers with his capacity for superior work \neven in extremis.\n\nThe New York Times Book Review\nThe first seven chapters are, like virtually everything [Hitchens] wrote over \nhis long, distinguished career, diamond-hard and brilliant. An eighth and final \nchapter consistsÃƒÂ of unfinished &quot;fragmentary jottings&quot; that he wrote in his \nterminal days in the critical-care unit of the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in \nHouston. They're vivid, heart-wrenching and hauntingÃƒÂ¹messages in a bottle \ntossed from the deck of a sinking ship as its captain, reeling in agony and \nfighting through the fog of morphine, struggles to keep his engines goingÃƒÂ \nBeing in Christopher's company was rarely sobering, but always exhilarating. \nIt is, however, sobering and grief-inducing to read this brave and harrowing \naccount of his &quot;year of living dyingly&quot; in the grip of the alien that succeeded \nwhere none of his debate opponents had in bringing him down.\nÃƒÂ¹Christopher Buckley\n\nPublishers Weekly\nDiagnosed with the esophageal cancer to which he eventually succumbed in \nDecember 2011, cultural critic Hitchens found himself a finalist in the race of \nlife, and in his typically unflinching and bold manner, he candidly shares his \nthoughts about his suffering, the etiquette of illness and wellness, and \nreligion in this stark and powerful memoir. Commenting on the persistent \nmetaphor of battle that doctors and friends use to describe his life with \ncancer (most of this book was published in Vanity Fair), Hitchens mightily \nchallenges this image, for ÃƒÂ´when you sit in a room... and kindly people bring a \nhuge transparent bag of poison and plug it into your arm, and you either \nread or donÃƒâ€ t read a book while the venom sack gradually empties itself into \nyour system, the image of the ardent soldier is the very last one that will \noccur to you.ÃƒÂ¶ As a result of his various treatments, Hitchens begins to lose \nhis voice, which, given his life as public gadfly through writing and speeches, \ndevastates him. ÃƒÂ´What do I hope for? If not a cure, then a remission. And \nwhat do I want back? In the most beautiful apposition of two of the simplest \nwords in our language: the freedom of speech.ÃƒÂ¶ HitchensÃƒâ€ s powerful voice \ncompels us to consider carefully the small measures by which we live every \nday and to cherish them.\n\nProduct Details\nISBN-13: 9781455502752\nPublisher: Grand Central Publishing\nPublication date: 9/4/2012\n---------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a9d5a40893ed8f991492752365c9d6c1190aada","amp;dn":"Christopher+Hitchens+-+Mortality+%5B96%5D+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a9d5a40893ed8f991492752365c9d6c1190aada","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,157,90,64,137,62,216,249,145,73,39,82,54,92,157,108,17,144,170,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
