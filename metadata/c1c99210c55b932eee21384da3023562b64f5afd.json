The band got its name from the UFOs and various aerial phenomena that were reported by Allied aircraft pilots in World War II, which were known collectively as foo fighters. Prior to the release of the Foo Fighters' 1995 debut album Foo Fighters, which featured Grohl as the only official member, Grohl drafted bassist Nate Mendel and drummer William Goldsmith, both formerly of Sunny Day Real Estate, as well as fellow Nirvana touring bandmate Pat Smear as guitarist to complete the lineup. The band began with performances in Portland, Oregon before gaining popularity. Goldsmith left during the recording of the group's second album, The Colour and the Shape (1997), and Smear's departure followed soon afterward. They were replaced by Taylor Hawkins and Franz Stahl, respectively, although Stahl left before the recording of the group's third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose (1999).\n\nChris Shiflett joined as the band's third guitarist after the completion of There Is Nothing Left to Lose. The band released its fourth album, One by One, in 2002. The group followed that release with the two-disc In Your Honor (2005), which was split between acoustic songs and heavier material. Foo Fighters released its sixth album, Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace, in 2007. In 2010, it was confirmed that Smear had officially rejoined the band after touring with the Foo Fighters as an unofficial member between 2006 and 2009. The band's seventh studio album, Wasting Light, is set for release in 2011.\n\n\nSonic Highways is the forthcoming eighth studio album by American rock band Foo Fighters, scheduled for release on November 10, 2014, through RCA Records.[1] As part of a companion HBO television series, Foo Fighters Sonic Highways, the band recorded eight songs for the album, each in a different US city: Austin, Chicago, Los Angeles, Nashville, New Orleans, New York, Seattle, and Washington, D.C.[4] It will be available on CD, vinyl and as a digital download. The album's lead single &quot;Something from Nothing&quot; was released on October 16, 2014.\n\nBANDMEMBERS:\n\nDave Grohl Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead vocals, rhythm guitar\nPat Smear Ã¢â‚¬â€œ rhythm guitar\nNate Mendel Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass\nTaylor Hawkins Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums, backing vocals\nChris Shiflett Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead guitar\nRami Jaffee Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keyboards\n\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01.
