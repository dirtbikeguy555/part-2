It won the Genie Award for Best Canadian Film.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;-\nVideo Specifications:_________________________________&quot;\normat                                    : AVI\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                                : 1.27 GiB\nDuration                                 : 2h 53mn\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 043 Kbps\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 2h 53mn\nBit rate                                 : 778 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 608 pixels\nHeight                                   : 336 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\nFrame rate                               : 25.000 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nAudio Specifications:__________________________________&quot;\nFormat                                   : AC-3\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                           : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness              : Big\nCodec ID                                 : 2000\nDuration                                 : 2h 53mn\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 256 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\n\n\n...
