For the first time in the SOCOM series, land and water vehicles play a central role in the gameplay experience. Vehicles are drivable by both players and AI and cover a range of military and civilian vehicles including tactical turret-equipped pickups and the SEAL-team configured military Humvee and SOC-R Assault Boat. \n\nThe innovative new weapon customization system in SOCOM 3 allows players to use more than 30 different weapons and attachments, resulting in nearly1,000 different weapon combinations. The new Team Command Actions (TCA) allows you to quickly give your teammates context sensitive commands such as move to, breach, and more, simply by pointing at the location and pressing a single button. Combined with more complex team and enemy AI behavior, SOCOM 3 presents a fully immersive and more intense tactical experience than ever before.\n\n\n\nGame Pics Included.\n\n\nBurn with DVD Decrypter, (Included in download).  \n\n\nBurn at 8x or 4x Speed.\n\n\nUse Verbatim or Taiyo Yuden DVD Media for best quality, or if other media isn't \nworking.\n\n\nIf Using DVD+R booktype to DVD-ROM.\n(If your Mod-Chip or Ps2 doesn't support DVD+R)\n\n\nAny Problems or questions please post a comment.\n\n\nIf this is working fine for you let us know write a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed this when your done.\n\n(I can't seed 24/7, do your part and seed to keep the torrent healthy).\n\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cef861ec268dd0d03708665db9e1a8f973c046eb","amp;dn":"Socom+3+U.S.+Navy+Seals+%28NTSC%29+PS2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cef861ec268dd0d03708665db9e1a8f973c046eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,248,97,236,38,141,208,208,55,8,102,93,185,225,168,249,115,192,70,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
