While the sound back then was SoCal skatepunk influenced by thrash elements and copious amounts of weed, Doughty and McDonald's playing and singing had matured considerably by 2001 and Live &amp; Direct: Acoustic Roots. The duo was later rounded by drummer Ryan Moran and percussionist/vocalist Oguer Ocon. By 2003 and Everything You Need, they were rocking a California-centric sound of loopy sampledelic pop, hip-hop influence, sunny marijuana affirmations, and the occasional return to raucous skatepunk.\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Ese Loco\n02.This Joint\n03.Collie Man\n04.Blood Of My Blood\n05.Till It Gets Wet\n06.Mellow Mood\n07.Ever Really Wanted\n08.Everything You Need\n09.Nico's (Acoustic) (Live)\n10.2 AM\n11.Castles Of Sand\n12.Babylon Is Falling\n13.Bandelero\n14.Wiseman\n15.The Otherside\n16.Closer To The Sun\n17.Killin' Me Deep Inside\n18.Souled (Acoustic) (Live)\n19.Digital\n20.I Would Do For You\n21.Prophet (Acoustic) (Live)\n22.Mr. Music\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ****You Don't Have To Thank Me.
