World-renowned herbalist Rosemary Gladstar guides you on the path to vibrant health and wellness in middle age and beyond. This exciting guide outlines the rejuvenating and healing properties of dozens of specific herbs, from astragalus -- which regenerates the body's immune system, helping to prevent and treat long-term infections -- to bilberry, which can prevent and cure eye problems as well as reduce excess sugar in the blood -- to milk thistle, which fights the damage cause by free radicals and can rebuild damaged liver cells. There are herbs to support heart function, aid your mind and memory, strengthen and soothe your nervous system, activate your metabolism, support your bones and joints, and improve your ability to handle stress. You'll learn how to choose the right herbs for your needs and how to prepare and use them safely and effectively, improving your vitality and well-being, whatever your age!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9ebb01546f8bcb1eb6b7d5a6aea1ac01f8ff764","amp;dn":"Herbs.for.LongLasting.Health.How.to.Make.and.Use.Herbal.Remedies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9ebb01546f8bcb1eb6b7d5a6aea1ac01f8ff764","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,235,176,21,70,248,188,177,235,107,125,90,106,234,26,192,31,143,247,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
