He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1929 and the Goethe Prize in 1949.\n\nHis first novel, BUDDENBROOKS (1901), won both popular and critical acclaim.  Deeply indebted to the German cultural tradition and specifically influenced by Schopenhauer, Wagner, and Nietzsche, Mann combines &quot;intellectual&quot; themes with vivid realism and comic flair.  Much of his work including the early novellas, &quot;Tonio KrÃƒÂ¶ger&quot; and &quot;Death in Venice&quot;, explores the psychology of the creative temperament and the often tragic position of the intellectual or artist in bourgeois society.  Politically he became an increasingly outspoken opponent of European fascism, a concern reflected in his second major novel, THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN (1924), and in later works.\n\nMann's exile from Hitler's Germany began in 1933, and he was deprived of his German citizenship in 1936.  In 1938, he settled in the United States, first as a visiting professor at Princeton and later in California, where he was celebrated as a leading spokesman for the threatened humanistic values of Western civilization.  He returned to Europe in 1952, spending the remaining three years of his life in Switzerland.  His most important late work was the monumental tragic novel, DOCTOR FAUSTUS (1947), an allegory both of creativity and of the fate of Germany in the twentieth century.  He also greatly extended the comic picaresque fragment, CONFESSIONS OF FELIX KRULL, which he had begun at the time of &quot;Death in Venice&quot;; it was never finished but appeared as his last novel in 1954.\n\n\nThis collection brings together many previously hard-to-find or out-of-print works, including novels, short stories, essays, letters, and wartime speeches.
