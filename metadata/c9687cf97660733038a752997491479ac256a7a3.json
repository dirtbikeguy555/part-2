Crichton (Elsevier, 2012).pdf\r\n\r\nBiological Inorganic Chemistry: A New Introduction to Molecular Structure and Function, Second Edition, provides a comprehensive discussion of the biochemical aspects of metals in living systems. \r\nBeginning with an overview of metals and selected nonmetals in biology, the book then discusses the following concepts: basic coordination chemistry for biologists; structural and molecular biology for chemists; biological ligands for metal ions; intermediary metabolism and bioenergetics; and methods to study metals in biological systems. \r\nThe book also covers metal assimilation pathways; transport, storage, and homeostasis of metal ions; sodium and potassium channels and pumps; magnesium phosphate metabolism and photoreceptors; calcium and cellular signaling; the catalytic role of several classes of mononuclear zinc enzymes; the biological chemistry of iron; and copper chemistry and biochemistry. In addition, the book discusses nickel and cobalt enzymes; manganese chemistry and biochemistry; molybdenum, tungsten, vanadium, and chromium; non-metals in biology; biomineralization; metals in the brain; metals and neurodegeneration; metals in medicine and metals as drugs; and metals in the environment.\r\n\r\nWinner of a 2013 Textbook Excellence Awards (Texty) from the Text and Academic Authors Association\r\nReadable style, complemented by anecdotes and footnotes\r\nEnables the reader to more readily grasp the biological and clinical relevance of the subject\r\nColor illustrations enable easy visualization of molecular mechanisms","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9687cf97660733038a752997491479ac256a7a3","amp;dn":"Biological+Inorganic+Chemistry+2nd+ed+-+Robert+R.+Crichton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9687cf97660733038a752997491479ac256a7a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,104,124,249,118,96,115,48,56,167,82,153,116,145,71,154,194,86,167,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
