Joe teaches how to use these new features to build pages that work across browsers with the functionality that today's users (and clients) are looking for, from complex animation effects to dynamic page formatting. Joe pulls all of this together, showing how the jQuery UI plug-in can expand and streamline the capability of jQuery, and then integrating jQuery design tools into a complete sample web site.
