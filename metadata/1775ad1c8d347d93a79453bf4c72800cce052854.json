Bob has promised his wife Jamie Munro, his teenage daughter Cassie Munro and his young son Carl Munro to spend vacations in Hawaii, but Todd demands him to prepare a presentation and attend a business meeting with the owners of a family company in a merging operation scheduled in the same period. Bob hides the truth to his family, rents a recreational vehicle and tries to convince his dysfunctional family that a road trip to the Colorado Rocky Mountains would be good to bring old values back to their family. After many incidents and while in the trailers parking area, the rookie Bob is helped by the bizarre but friendly Gornicke family. They escape from the Gornickes and initiate a journey of difficulties and leaning, retrieving their forgotten family bonds.\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cdn.piczend.com/images/LMJCRjQV/cfvmvg6yga2lqexvpvipjrrwv.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cdn.piczend.com/images/LMJCRjQV/cfvmvg6yga2lqexvpvipjrrwv.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cdn.piczend.com/images/LMJCRjQV/wxwoa1hfmt1jppppir5nfq20y.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cdn.piczend.com/images/LMJCRjQV/wxwoa1hfmt1jppppir5nfq20y.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1775ad1c8d347d93a79453bf4c72800cce052854","amp;dn":"RV+%282006%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1775ad1c8d347d93a79453bf4c72800cce052854","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,117,173,28,141,52,125,147,167,148,83,191,76,114,128,12,206,5,40,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
