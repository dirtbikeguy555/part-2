Gamers will play as Agent Thomas, an investigator in the FBIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Serial Crimes Unit (SCU), whose pursuit of relentless serial killers leads him through urban environments filled with sociopaths lurking on the periphery of humanity.\n\nPresented in a first-person view for maximum visceral effect, this atmospheric thriller is best played with the surround-sound up and the lights off. Given the power of nextgeneration hardware, Condemned: Criminal Origins features photo-realistic backdrops, life-like physics, and highly sophisticated artificial intelligence. Weapons and ammunition are scarce, leaving the player vulnerable to a gallery of mentally deranged criminals. Careful detective work and precision reflexes are a playerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s primary means of survival. Inspired in part by the films of the psychological thriller sub-genre, Condemned: Criminal Origins maintains an intense, focused pace. Players can never be sure what waits around each corner.\n\n\nHardware Requirements:\n\n2GHz CPU/ 512MB RAM ATI 9500 video, GF 6200 or better Win2K/XP Recommended System: 2.4GHz CPU 768MB RAM ATI 9800 video, GF 6800 or better Win2K/XP\n\n\n\nExtract Archive To Any Desired Directory With Winrar Or 7zip etc.........\n\n\nNO INSTALL JUST EXTRACT AND PLAY \n\nStart Game With &quot;Condemned.exe&quot;\n\nTHIS IS FULL GAME NOTHING MISSING\n\n\nENJOY AND PLEASE SEED\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77303d563f2b56829cdfa9c2c680b5604e2f4f1b","amp;dn":"Condemned.Criminal.Origins.PC.Game%28djDEVASTATE%C3%A2%E2%80%9E%C2%A2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77303d563f2b56829cdfa9c2c680b5604e2f4f1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,48,61,86,63,43,86,130,156,223,169,194,198,128,181,96,78,47,79,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
