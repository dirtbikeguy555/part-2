The Rifftrax audio track has been newly remastered to ensure the riff comments are just loud enough to be clear when the movie is loud and not too loud when the movie is quiet. Please leave any feedback regarding the Rifftrax audio remastering.\n\nNote for the Rifftrax audio track - audio1, 2.0 Riff - DisembAudio's singing during the credits pushed the Rifftrax intro comments longer than the video running time. The picture just displays the movie company logo during this final audio part.\n\nBig thanks to the posters of the subs and the chapters.
