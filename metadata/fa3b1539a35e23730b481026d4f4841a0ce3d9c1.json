The tale tells the stories of many characters whose lives sometimes intersect. However, all is seen through the eyes of a singular narrator: BuscapÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©, a poor black youth too frail and scared to become an outlaw but also to smart to be content with underpaid, menial jobs. He grows up in a very violent environment. The odds are all against him. But BuscapÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© soon discovers that he can see reality differently than others. His redemption is that he's been given an artist's point of view as a keen-eyed photographer. As BuscapÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© is not the real protagonist of the film--only the narrator--he is not the one who makes the decisions that will determine the sequence of events. Nevertheless, not only his life is attached to what happens in the story, but it is also through BuscapÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©'s perspective of life that one can understand the complicated layers and humanity of a world, apparently condemned to endless violence.\n\nGeneral #0\nComplete name        : Cidade De Deus.avi\nFormat               : AVI\nFormat/Info          : Audio Video Interleave\nFormat/Family        : RIFF\nFile size            : 704 MiB\nPlayTime             : 2h 4mn\nBit rate             : 783 Kbps\nWriting application  : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nWriting library      : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\nIAS1                 : Portugues\n\nVideo #0\nCodec                : XviD\nCodec/Family         : MPEG-4\nCodec/Info           : XviD project\nCodec settings/Packe : No\nCodec settings/BVOP  : Yes\nCodec settings/QPel  : No\nCodec settings/GMC   : 0\nCodec settings/Matri : Custom\nPlayTime             : 2h 4mn\nBit rate             : 656 Kbps\nWidth                : 480 pixels\nHeight               : 256 pixels\nAspect ratio         : 1.875\nFrame rate           : 25.000 fps\nResolution           : 8 bits\nChroma               : 4:2:0\nInterlacement        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)   : 0.214\nWriting library      : XviD0043\n\nAudio #0\nCodec                : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\nCodec profile        : Joint stereo\nPlayTime             : 2h 4mn\nBit rate             : 114 Kbps\nBit rate mode        : VBR\nChannel(s)           : 2 channels\nSampling rate        : 48 KHz\nResolution           : 16 bits\nWriting library      : LAME3.97b\nEncoding settings    : ABR\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa3b1539a35e23730b481026d4f4841a0ce3d9c1","amp;dn":"Cidade+de+Deus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa3b1539a35e23730b481026d4f4841a0ce3d9c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,59,21,57,163,94,35,115,11,72,16,38,212,244,132,26,12,227,217,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
