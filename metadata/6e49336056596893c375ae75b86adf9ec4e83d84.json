ANSYS 17.0 delivers solutions faster so engineers and designers can make more informed decisions sooner in the product development cycle. That enables organizations to rapidly innovate and bring products to market faster, while getting more productivity from their existing engineering assets.\r\n\r\nThrough tighter integration of semiconductor and electronics simulation solutions, ANSYS 17.0 delivers a comprehensive chip-package-system design workflow. New capabilities for automated thermal analysis and integrated structural analysis deliver an unequalled chip-aware and system-aware simulation solution, enabling customers to deliver smaller, higher-power density devices to market faster. With the advent of the Internet of Things, more products and engineers will rely on these capabilities.\r\n\r\nIn the fluids suite, ANSYS continues its technology leadership with breakthrough advancements in physics modeling and introduces new innovations across the entire workflow and user environment design to accelerate time to results by up to 85 percent without compromising accuracy. Improvements to workflow and meshing enable novice users to quickly become productive while new tools and options expand the application reach for experienced users.\r\n\r\n&quot;ANSYS has broken through by truly integrating multi-domain 3-D meshed solutions,&quot; said Brad Kramer, director of engineering at HUSCO International. &quot;By closely integrating the fluid and the mechanical interfaces, we are now able to simulate and gain insight into the real physics of the problem without having to set up artificial boundary conditions.&quot;\r\n\r\nPreprocessing â€“ or the act of setting up simulations â€“ with ANSYS 17.0 has also improved by an order of magnitude. Using the direct modeling tools in ANSYS 17.0, users can prepare their geometry for analysis faster than traditional computer-aided design (CAD). Save and load times for complex models, as well as the performance for common geometry editing functions has increased by up to 100 times. ANSYS 17.0 geometry tools also boast tighter integration to ANSYS Workbench and offer many productivity advancements for modeling fabricated and composite structures. Fluids pre-processing for complex systems has also improved dramatically. The process of preparing and meshing models with hundreds of parts has been reduced from days to hours with ANSYS 17.0. \r\n\r\nANSYS 17.0 enables software engineers to be more productive with developing, testing and certifying embedded software. New industry-specific vertical solutions take full benefit from the openness and flexibility of the platform to facilitate interactions with original equipment manufacturers and suppliers while adhering to such industry standards as ARINC 661/664, FACE and AUTOSAR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e49336056596893c375ae75b86adf9ec4e83d84","amp;dn":"ANSYS.PRODUCTS.17.0.WINX64-SSQ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e49336056596893c375ae75b86adf9ec4e83d84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,73,51,96,86,89,104,147,195,117,174,117,184,106,223,158,196,232,61,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
