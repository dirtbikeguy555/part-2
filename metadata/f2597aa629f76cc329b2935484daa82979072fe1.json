It took the songwriting supergroup three years, but here it is â€” and it actually lives up to expectations.\r\nOn opener â€œAtomic Number,â€ the three singersâ€™ distinct voices swap lines: langâ€™s rich alto, Veirsâ€™ delicate, breathy yet steady voice and Caseâ€™s torchy wail overlapping and combining together, much like the pure elements theyâ€™re using as metaphors. Yet this is hardly a template for the record as a whole, which sometimes evokes â€™50s and â€™60s girl groups (the k.d. lang-led â€œHoney and Smoke,â€ with its tumbling â€œI know, I know, I know, I knowâ€ call and response vocals is a good example) but more often than not finds Case, lang and Veirs taking turns leading for a song while the other two harmonize. The overall impression is of stylistically fused alternation.\r\n\r\nThe collaboration is arguably Veirs-heavy; she had a hand in the lionâ€™s share of the songwriting, her husband Tucker Martine produced the record and she plays guitar on it. Plus, her 2013 album Warp and Weft may have been a bit of a trial run for this project, as both lang and Case appeared on it.\r\n\r\nYet, the record feels quite balanced, and it doesnâ€™t really matter how Case, lang and Veirs got there â€” they did it. The intricate and delicate â€œBehind The Armoryâ€ and jangly â€œDeliriumâ€ sound like Neko Case songs though all three wrote them, and langâ€™s jazzy blue ballads (one of which is actually called â€œBlue Firesâ€) contribute a whole other dimension to the record. It takes a number of listens for it to sink in how profoundly right-on her vocals are.\r\n\r\ncase/lang/veirs wrote the songs together, but they didnâ€™t get them down in a vacuum: Martine did a typically fantastic job assembling a cast of musicians, and case/lang/veirs â€” a forward-thinking folk album thatâ€™s percussively textured (thanks chiefly to Glenn Kotche, but also Rob Burger on keyboards and piano) with wonderful details like horns that appear for just one song on bouncy, bursting â€œBest Kept Secret,â€ and the moody, oboe-like use of Burgerâ€™s claviola â€” sounds absolutely verdant.\r\n\r\nThe strings on case/lang/veirs are so smart, sensitive and integral to the feel of the record that they almost warrant being called the albumâ€™s fourth singer. Or, to be more accurate: two more singers, as two different groups of string players were involved, the first fleshing out a handful of the strongest songs, pop-style, and the second, arranged by Stephen Barber and performed by Tosca String Quartet, more expansive and orchestral.\r\n\r\nVeirs is (or at least was, until now) the least-known member of the brand new group, and I think sheâ€™s ripe for discovery. Her â€œSong For Judeeâ€ (which almost didnâ€™t make the cut) and â€œBest Kept Secretâ€ are both moving tributes â€” the first for â€™70s songwriter Judee Sill, and the second (the kind of song you wish someone would write about you) for her friend Tim Young, who actually plays guitar on the album.\r\n\r\nBut then, every song is strong. The thing with this collaboration is that, as on all great records, your favourite songs are liable to shift around a little. And what this songwriting team has to offer isnâ€™t just pretty, though it can be that â€” itâ€™s also pretty profound, passionate and substantial.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n01 - Atomic Number.flac\r\n02 - Honey And Smoke.flac\r\n03 - Song For Judee.flac\r\n04 - Blue Fires.flac\r\n05 - Delirium.flac\r\n06 - Greens of June.flac\r\n07 - Behind The Armory.flac\r\n08 - Best Kept Secret.flac\r\n09 - 1000 Miles Away.flac\r\n10 - Supermoon.flac\r\n11 - I Want To Be Here.flac\r\n12 - Down.flac\r\n13 - Why Do We Fight.flac\r\n14 - Georgia Stars.flac\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\nCountry: Canada\r\nGenre: Indie-Folk\r\n\r\n\r\nMedia Report:\r\nSource : CD\r\nFormat : FLAC\r\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec, 16-bit PCM\r\nBit rate mode : Variable\r\nBit rate : ~755-928 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\r\nBit depth : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2597aa629f76cc329b2935484daa82979072fe1","amp;dn":"%282016%29+Neko+Case%2C+k.d.+lang%2C+Laura+Veirs+-+case-lang-veirs+%5BFLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2597aa629f76cc329b2935484daa82979072fe1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,89,122,166,41,247,108,195,41,178,147,84,132,218,168,41,121,7,47,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
