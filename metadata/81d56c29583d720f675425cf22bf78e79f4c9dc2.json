How did a small town in rural Italy produce the dozens of painters and sculptors who ignited the Italian Renaissance? Why are so many great soccer players from Brazil? \nWhere does talent come from, and how does it grow? \nNew research has revealed that myelin, once considered an inert form of insulation for brain cells, may be the holy grail of acquiring skill. Journalist Daniel Coyle spent years investigating talent hotbeds, interviewing world-class practitioners (top soccer players, violinists, fighter, pilots, artists, and bank robbers) and neuroscientists. In clear, accessible language, he presents a solid strategy for skill acquisition in athletics, fine arts, languages, science or math that can be successfully applied through a person 's entire lifespan.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81d56c29583d720f675425cf22bf78e79f4c9dc2","amp;dn":"The+Talent+Code","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81d56c29583d720f675425cf22bf78e79f4c9dc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,213,108,41,88,61,114,15,103,84,37,207,34,191,120,231,159,76,157,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
