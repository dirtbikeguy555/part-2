From the emergence of mind, he traces the evolution of human consciousness through its major stages of growth and development. He particularly focuses on modernity and postmodernity: what they mean; how they impact gender issues, psychotherapy, ecological concerns, and various liberation movements; and how the modern and postmodern world conceive of Spirit. This second edition features forty pages of new material, new diagrams, and extensively revised notes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5030593f0247680f6a1d75dd522cf5feb2e7642","amp;dn":"%5BEPUB%2FPDF%5D+Ken+Wilber+-+Sex%2CEcology%2CSpirituality","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5030593f0247680f6a1d75dd522cf5feb2e7642","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,3,5,147,240,36,118,128,246,161,215,93,213,34,207,95,235,46,118,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
