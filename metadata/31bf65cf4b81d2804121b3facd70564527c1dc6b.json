Bert was deeply disappointed to miss the September and October shows, as he enjoyed every moment of touring with Neil over the summer, as well as the West Coast shows he played with the Pegi Young Band opening. He was also particularly disappointed to miss an appearance at Farm Aid, which he was very much looking forward to. However, he is delighted to report that the surgery was successful, and the new confirmed dates are:\n\nWED DEC 8 - PHILADELPHIA, PA - Johnny Brenda's (with Meg Baird)\n\nTHU DEC 9 - BOSTON, MA - Johnny D's (with the Pegi Young Band)\n\nSAT DEC 11 - HARTFORD, CT - Wadsworth Atheneum (with the Pegi Young Band)\n\nMON DEC 13 - VIENNA, VA - Jammin Java (with the Pegi Young Band)\n\nWED DEC 15 - BROOKLYN, NY - Bell House (with the Pegi Young Band)\n\nFRI DEC 17 - PITTSBURGH, PA - First Unitarian Church (with the Pegi Young Band)\n\nSAT DEC 18 - BUFFALO, NY - Town Ballroom (with the Pegi Young Band)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bertjansch.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bertjansch.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31bf65cf4b81d2804121b3facd70564527c1dc6b","amp;dn":"Bert+Jansch+Remasters+%5B1965-1973%5D+%5Bmp3-vbr-2001%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31bf65cf4b81d2804121b3facd70564527c1dc6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,191,101,207,75,129,210,128,65,33,179,250,205,112,86,69,39,193,220,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
