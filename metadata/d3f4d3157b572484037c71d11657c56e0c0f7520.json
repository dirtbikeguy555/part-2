Rowling\r\nBased on an original new story by J.K. Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, a new play by Jack\r\nThorne, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is the eighth story in the Harry Potter series and the first\r\nofficial Harry Potter story to be presented on stage. The play will receive its world premiere in\r\nLondonâ€™s West End on July 30, 2016.\r\nIt was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isnâ€™t much easier now that he is an overworked\r\nemployee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband and father of three school-age children.\r\nWhile Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must\r\nstruggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously,\r\nboth father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected\r\nplaces.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3f4d3157b572484037c71d11657c56e0c0f7520","amp;dn":"Harry+Potter+and+the+Cursed+Child+%26ndash%3B+Parts+One+and+Two","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3f4d3157b572484037c71d11657c56e0c0f7520","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,244,211,21,123,87,36,132,3,124,113,209,22,87,197,110,12,15,117,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
