The covers on the album include Jeff's highly personal interpretations of songs written by Bob Dylan (&quot;Just Like a Woman&quot;); Sylvester Stewart (&quot;Everyday People,&quot; recorded by Sly &amp; the Family Stone); Joe Green (&quot;Don't Let the Sun Catch You Cryin',&quot; recorded by Louis Jordan, Ray Charles and others); Bob Telson (&quot;Calling You,&quot; recorded by Jevetta Steele for the 1987 film Bagdad CafÃ©); Morrissey and Johnny Marr (&quot;The Boy with the Thorn in His Side&quot; and &quot;I Know It's Over,&quot; recorded by the Smiths); Booker T. Washington &quot;Bukka&quot; White (&quot;Poor Boy Long Way from Home,&quot; from a 1939 &quot;field&quot; recording made by John Lomax) and John Paul Jones/Jimmy Page/Robert Plant (&quot;Night Flight,&quot; recorded by Led Zeppelin).\r\n\r\nRounding out You and I are two pieces of original music: the first-ever solo studio recording of his signature song, &quot;Grace&quot; and &quot;Dream of You and I,&quot; a mysterious and haunting piece which informs the deeply intimate and profoundly personal mood of the album.\r\n\r\nThese 10 tracks offer an incredible, rare glimpse of an artist, alone, in the sacred space that is the studio. There's an intimacy and an honesty to the performances that's literally breathtaking. You &amp; I is an important addition to Jeff's recorded legacy and will be a thrill for both his devoted longtime fans and newcomers alike","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:089f59174b152c74679aaf346092669a732dbbcb","amp;dn":"Jeff+Buckley+-+You+and+I+%282016%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"089f59174b152c74679aaf346092669a732dbbcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,159,89,23,75,21,44,116,103,154,175,52,96,146,102,154,115,45,187,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
