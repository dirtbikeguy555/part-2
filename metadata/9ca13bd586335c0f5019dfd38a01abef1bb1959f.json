The tracks are a walloping war-cry from a generation that up until this point has only offered bubblegum popÃ¢â‚¬â€the animus of The Orwells. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quite clear early on the in listening to the LP that the band is well aware of the past, the homage rings through the record, using the ghost of punkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past as their musical sprit guide. However, the band straddles the thing line between their influences and their originality, ripping riffs and smashing drums in a fashion that their age into being just another fact mentioned in their bio.\n\nThe Orwells are made up of five dudes from Chicago, Illinois. They play rock n roll music. Their names are Mario, Grant, Henry, Dominick and Matt. They write songs Ã¢â‚¬â€ scratch that, primitive teenage battle cries Ã¢â‚¬â€ about girls and America and being suspended from high school. Although one might categorize The OrwellsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ distinct brand of the blues as garage or punk, they would be wrong. The Orwells sound comes from a deeper, different placeÃ¢â‚¬â€œa place both long forgotten and also timeless.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ApTMpi1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ApTMpi1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ca13bd586335c0f5019dfd38a01abef1bb1959f","amp;dn":"The+Orwells+-+Remember+When+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ca13bd586335c0f5019dfd38a01abef1bb1959f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,161,59,213,134,51,92,15,80,25,223,211,138,1,171,239,27,177,149,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
