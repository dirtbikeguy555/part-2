Since her self-titled released back in 2006 certified platinum, Taylor has gone on to break an array of records worldwide with subsequent releases. Her last record Fearless reached double platinum status in the US after its release and was the yearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s biggest US debut for any female artist. With her new single Mine due for release on October 11th already garnering much attention, Speak Now will clearly be no exception to her success. Swifts lyrical efforts have oftenbeen described as autobiographical therefore she chose to express full writing credit for the new record alongside Nathan Chapman serving as co-producer.\n\nTracklist:\n\nDisc 1/2\n\n1.
