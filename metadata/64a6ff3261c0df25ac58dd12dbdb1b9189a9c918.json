Determined to take part in the Queen's Blade tournament, she arrives at the capital city Gainos, where Queen Aldora awaits. There gathers a number of beautiful warriors who, like Reina, are there for the Queen's Blade.\n\nAmongst them is Reina's sister, Claudette, determined to restore the glory of House Vance; Tomoe and Shizuka, who are both fighting for their homeland of Hinomoto; Nanael who has been ordered to participate by the Archangel; and the subordinates of the Marshland Witch.\n\nAll these beautiful fighters who gather in Gainos have been one objective, to win through the Queen's Blade, the tournament to select the strongest, most beautiful queen. Who would ascend to that glorious throne? That can only be determined via battle.\n\nSeason 01\nIn a land where a queen is chosen every few years solely by winning a tournament, there can be no short supply of formidable opponents. For one woman warrior however, an early defeat clearly shows her that she is lacking in experience though she may be bountiful in body.\n\nFortunately, while defeat could spell one's doom, her life is saved by a powerful stranger. But unfortunately for this savior, less-than-pure motives and shrewd family members mean her reward is a prison cell. Her release is prompt when the unseasoned warrior she saved, tired of her current lifestyle of nobility, sets off to prove herself.\n\nContainer...........................Matroska\nFile size ...........................: 190-225MB\nOverall bit rate ..................:-1300Kbps\nWidth ................................: 1280\nHeight ...............................: 720\nDisplay aspect ratio .............: 16:9\nAudio Track 01....................English\nAudio Track 02......................Japanese \nFrame rate ..........................: 23.976 fps\nEpisodes............................. 24\nSubtitles............................ASS/ English\n\n[img]http://kastatic.com/i2/u/1750301/M7tRf1u8iF.png[/img]\n[img]http://kastatic.com/i2/u/1750301/lB0a2RdrG9.png[/img]\n[img]http://kastatic.com/i2/u/1750301/VlqNxJYf50.png[/img][/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64a6ff3261c0df25ac58dd12dbdb1b9189a9c918","amp;dn":"Queens+Blade+Season+1-2+BDRip+%5B1280x720+Dual-Audio%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64a6ff3261c0df25ac58dd12dbdb1b9189a9c918","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,166,255,50,97,192,223,37,172,88,221,18,219,219,27,145,137,169,201,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
