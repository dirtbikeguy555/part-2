The album was the first released by Petty after   \n          signing a contract with Warner Bros. Records and the first of three albums produced  \n          by Rick Rubin.                                                                       \n                                                                                               \n          Three singles were released from the album between 1994 and 1995, the most successful\n          of which, &quot;You Don't Know How It Feels&quot;, reached #13 on the Billboard Hot 100 and    \n          topped the Album Rock Tracks chart for one week.                                     \n                                                                                               \n          The album features all members of the Heartbreakers with the exception of drummer    \n          Stan Lynch, who left the band earlier in 1994. Steve Ferrone plays drums on          \n          Wildflowers and would join the band officially the following year. However, the album\n          was not credited to the Heartbreakers because, in Petty's words, &quot;Rick (Rubin) and I \n          both wanted more freedom than to be strapped into five guys.&quot;                        \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                 Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,            \n                 HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality         \n                 of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!                  \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n               Track Listing....:                                                              \n                 01.Wildflowers                 [03:12]                                        \n                 02.You don't know how it feels [04:49]                                        \n                 03.Time to move on             [03:15]                                        \n                 04.You wreck me                [03:23]                                        \n                 05.It's good to be king        [05:11]                                        \n                 06.Only A broken heart         [04:31]                                        \n                 07.Honey bee                   [04:59]                                        \n                 08.Don't fade on me            [03:32]                                        \n                 09.Hard on me                  [03:49]                                        \n                 10.Cabin down below            [02:51]                                        \n                 11.To find A friend            [03:24]                                        \n                 12.A higher place              [03:56]                                        \n                 13.House in the woods          [05:32]                                        \n                 14.Crawling back to you        [05:06]                                        \n                 15.Wake up time                [05:19]                                        \n                                                       ____                                    \n                                                                                               \n                                               62:49 min                                       \n                                                92,0 MB               \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:808407018deb8941e400d063c91a88f55469af6c","amp;dn":"Tom_Petty-Wildflowers-%28Retail%29-1994-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"808407018deb8941e400d063c91a88f55469af6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,132,7,1,141,235,137,65,228,0,208,99,201,26,136,245,84,105,175,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
