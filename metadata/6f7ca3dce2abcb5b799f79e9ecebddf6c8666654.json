Rea started out performing with a local group called Magdalene, taking David Coverdale's place; the band won a national talent contest in 1975 as the Beautiful Losers, but still failed to get a record contract. Rea left the band and recorded the album Whatever Happened to Benny Santini?, which alluded to a discarded stage name, which went gold on the strength of the U.S. Top 20 hit &quot;Fool (If You Think It's Over).&quot; Rea was not heard from again in the U.S. for some time, concentrating his efforts on his main fan base of Europe. A compilation of tracks from Rea's '80s albums, New Light Through Old Windows, was released in 1988 and sold well in the U.K. and Europe and charted in the U.S. Rea followed it up with the critically acclaimed The Road to Hell, which many regarded as his best album. It and its follow-up, Auberge, went to the top of the U.K. album charts, but did not prove as successful in the U.S., where he has failed to chart with his subsequent releases. He released his most ambitious project in 2005, an eleven-album, 130-track box set of all new material inspired by the blues and his own paintings called Blue Guitars. The fun The Return of the Fabulous Hofner Blue Notes appeared in 2008.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.The Road To Hell (Pt. 2)\n02.Auberge\n03.The Blue Cafe\n04.Josephine\n05.On The Beach\n06.Looking For The Summer\n07.Sweet Summer Day\n08.All Summer Long\n09.Where Do We Go From Here\n10.Driving Home For Christmas\n11.(Fool) If You Think It's Over\n12.Still Beautiful\n13.Stick By You\n14.I Just Wanna Be With You\n15.King Of The Beach\n16.Nothing To Fear\n17.Johnny Needs A Fast Car\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.That's What They Always Say\n02.Windy Town\n03.Thinking Of You\n04.God's Great Banana Skin\n05.Two Roads\n06.Keep On Dancing\n07.Texas\n08.Let's Dance\n09.You Must Be Evil\n10.Waiting For A Blue Sky\n11.Stainsby Girls\n12.God Gave Me An Angel\n13.Changing Times\n14.Julia\n15.Tell Me There's A Heaven\n16.I Can Hear Your Heartbeat\n17.Winter Song\n18.Gone Fishing\n19.Sing A Song Of Love To Me\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n                 \n                   ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f7ca3dce2abcb5b799f79e9ecebddf6c8666654","amp;dn":"Chris+Rea+-+Greatest+Hits+2CD+%282007%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f7ca3dce2abcb5b799f79e9ecebddf6c8666654","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,124,163,220,226,171,203,91,121,159,121,233,236,235,221,246,200,102,102,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
