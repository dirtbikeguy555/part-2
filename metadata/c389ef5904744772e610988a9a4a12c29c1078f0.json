Artists include Sam Kieth, Mike Dringenberg, Jill Thompson, Shawn McManus, Marc Hempel and Michael Zulli, lettering by Todd Klein, and covers by Dave McKean. Beginning with issue #47, it was placed under the imprint Vertigo. It chronicles the adventures of Dream (of the Endless), who rules over the world of dreams. It ran for 75 issues from January 1989 until March 1996. Gaiman's contract stipulated that the series would end when he left it.\n\nThe Sandman was one of Vertigo's flagship titles, and is available as a series of ten trade paperbacks. It has also been reprinted in a recolored five-volume Absolute hardcover edition with slipcase. Critically acclaimed, The Sandman is one of the few graphic novels ever to be on the New York Times Best Seller list, along with Watchmen and The Dark Knight Returns. It was one of five graphic novels to make Entertainment Weekly's &quot;100 best reads from 1983 to 2008&quot;, ranking at 46. Norman Mailer described the series as &quot;a comic strip for intellectuals.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c389ef5904744772e610988a9a4a12c29c1078f0","amp;dn":"The+Sandman+%2801+-+75+%26amp%3B+extras%29+%28Neil+Gaiman%29+%28-+Nem+-%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c389ef5904744772e610988a9a4a12c29c1078f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,137,239,89,4,116,71,114,230,16,152,138,154,74,18,194,156,16,120,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
