Taylor also has a knack for very dark and sobering themes -- this 2001 release, in fact, is full of them. On White African, Taylor's subject matter ranges from lynching in the Deep South (&quot;Saint Martha Blues&quot;) to homelessness (&quot;Hungry People&quot;) to being unable to afford health care for a sick, dying child (&quot;3 Days and 3 Nights&quot;). And Taylor doesn't try to sugarcoat his often disturbing lyrics with happy melodies. Greatly influenced by John Lee Hooker, the very soulful Taylor often favors moody, dusky, haunting grooves. So White African is as dark musically as it is lyrically. Over the years, dark humor has played a major role in the blues -- like country and hip-hop artists, bluesmen are known for finding a variety of humorous, clever ways to tell you how cruel and punishing life can be. But White African isn't dark humored; it's simply dark. This is also incredibly compelling, and it is enthusiastically recommended to those who don't expect lighthearted escapism from all of their music. ~ Alex Henderson\n\nRecorded at Fanfare Studios, Golden, Colorado.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1 My Soul's In Louisiana 3:35 \n2 Resurrection Blues 5:59 \n3 Momma Don't You Do It 2:24 \n4 3 Days and 3 Nights 4:21 \n5 Round and Round 1:48 \n6 Stick On You 3:31 \n7 Rain So Hard 3:52 \n8 Lost My Horse 3:11 \n9 Saint Martha Blues 4:16 \n10 Ain't No Cowgirl 2:15 \n11 Hungry People 5:02\n\nRecorded at Fanfare Studios, Golden, Colorado.[/size]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94b74bb6d922d934211cfc263d00cf2b2156ac0b","amp;dn":"Otis+Taylor++White+African%28blues%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94b74bb6d922d934211cfc263d00cf2b2156ac0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,183,75,182,217,34,217,52,33,28,252,38,61,0,207,43,33,86,172,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
