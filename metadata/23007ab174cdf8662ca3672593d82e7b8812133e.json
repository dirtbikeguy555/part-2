Period. No other software product in the music industry even comes close to the selection, performance and overall sonic accuracy when it comes to creating guitar and bass tones with a computer. Now, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a mighty big mouthful of brag, but a wise old country gentleman once told me, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hey, it ainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bragging if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s true.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nAmpliTube 3 has the largest selection of gear available, and our development team is continuously building upon that selection. In the complete AmpliTube 3 flagship full version, there are 160 individual pieces of gear to choose from. Plus, you can add other packages to the mix like AmpliTube OrangeÃ‚Â®, AmpliTube FenderÃ‚Â®, AmpegÃ‚Â® SVX, AmpliTube Slash and more and choose from over 230 pieces of gear. Mind blowing.\n(The other packages they're talking about are included in this torrent)\n\n                ____________________________________________________\n\n\nCommentary : (from uploader, akun)\n\nThis is a good guitar and bass modelling software, especially because it has a lot of amp/cabinets model, and the quality is pretty good ! also one good point is that it adds only 0.1 ms of latency for the needs of processing (while gtr from waves adds 0.8 ms and others even more, that is unacceptable for real-time playing to have such latency !)\n\n                ____________________________________________________\n\n\nTested clean on a Windows 7 x64 virtual machine running with ESET Nod 32 5.2.9.1\nVirus database v.8272 (2013 04 26)\nTested crack and stability on Windows 7 x64 with Presonus Studio One 2.5, Nuendo 4.3 and Pro Tools 10 HD\nTime tested: + 5 hours\n                ____________________________________________________\n\n\n[SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FROM UPLOADER:]\n\nPlease be careful at correctly selecting the path of your VST folders at the installation of amplitube, for example if you run windows 7 x64 the folders will be swapped by default in the installation, so the 32-bit plug-in will be in the 64-bit VST folder and vice versa.\n\n                ____________________________________________________\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.Unrar.                                                           \n2.Install Amplitube 3.                                             \n3.Install our crack.                                               \n4.Enjoy!                                                           \n\n                ____________________________________________________\n\nSupport the software creators !\n\n________________\n\nPS: Help me to seed please, I have a 1 mbps bandwidth and this is the only release of AmpliTube.3.v3.10.0 on The Pirate Bay !\nPost feedback please as i'm a new uploader ! :)\n\n________________\n\nABOD.
