Keeping the new interns on their toes are: the fatherly chief of medicine, Dr. Bob Kelso (Ken Jenkins); the abrasive, worldly Dr. Perry Cox (John McGinley) , and the caring but slightly jaded nurse Carla Espinosa (Judy Reyes). The hospital janitor (Neil Flynn) also never seems to miss an opportunity to harass his target. (NBC Seasons 1-3 Press Release)\n\nScrubs is filmed on a real-life hospital. It&amp;#039;s the North Hollywood Medical Center, which has gone under severe reconstruction to fit all the equipment and represent Sacred Heart Hospital. Interesting trivia: Sacred Heart was the name of the school that Christa Miller worked; in one episode Zach Braff accidentally calls the Janitor Neil Flynn, which is the actor&amp;#039;s real life name.\n\nEpisodenames:\nScrubs 401 My old friend&amp;#039;s new friend\nScrubs 402 My office\nScrubs 403 My new game\nScrubs 404 My first kill\nScrubs 405 Her story\nScrubs 406 My cake\nScrubs 407 My common enemy\nScrubs 408 My last chance\nScrubs 409 My malpractical decision\nScrubs 410 My female trouble\nScrubs 411 My unicorn\nScrubs 412 My best moment\nScrubs 413 My ocrdiar infarction\nScrubs 414 My lucky charm\nScrubs 415 My hypocritical oath\nScrubs 416 My quarantine\nScrubs 417 My life in four cameras\nScrubs 418 My roommates\nScrubs 419 My best made plans\nScrubs 420 My boss&amp;#039;s free haircut\nScrubs 421 My lips are sealed\nScrubs 422 My big move\nScrubs 423 My Faith in Humanity\nScrubs 424 My drive-by\nScrubs 425 My changing ways\t\t\n\nOfficial Homepage: http://scrubs-tv.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4f3bd09f10f1d49a9c9cdcf9eb81c7fe919de2c","amp;dn":"Scrubs+Season+4+%5BPDTV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4f3bd09f10f1d49a9c9cdcf9eb81c7fe919de2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,243,189,9,241,15,29,73,169,201,205,207,158,184,28,127,233,25,222,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
