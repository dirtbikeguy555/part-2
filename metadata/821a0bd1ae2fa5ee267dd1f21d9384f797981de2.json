Beatty, Susan S. Samuelson\n\n\n\nProduct Details\nPaperback: 672 pages\nPublisher: Cengage Learning; 4 edition (January 11, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 113318815X\nISBN-13: 978-1133188155\n\nEditorial Reviews\nReview\n&quot;What I like about this book is that it is a business book, not a law book. I like the short chapters.&quot;\n\n&quot;The author's narrative style, the vignettes, and the humor are excellent. The book is relevant and topical. Well done. Concise and clear. The definitions in the margins are excellent. My students all end up keeping the book rather than selling it back.&quot;\n\nAbout the Author\nJeffrey F. Beatty was a two-time winner of the Beckwith Prize, Boston University's highest undergraduate teaching award. His research expertise included constitutional law, torts, contracts, and the uniform commercial code. In 1998, the Academy of Legal Studies in Business (ALSB) awarded him the Charles Hewitt Award for excellence in teaching, presented annually to one professor in the United States. The highest honor for teaching conferred by the ALSB, this award is dedicated to the communication and recognition of creative teaching practices of business law. Prior to his teaching, Professor Beatty worked for several years as a legal aid lawyer, concentrating on immigration law and general civil litigation. He also practiced in a private firm, where he concentrated on general civil litigation, including trials and appeals of tort, contract, employment, and property cases.\n\nSusan S. Samuelson is a tenured full professor in the Business Policy and Law Department of the School of Management at Boston University, where she has been awarded the Broderick Prize in recognition of outstanding teaching accomplishments. She teaches both law and ethics to undergraduates, graduate students, and executives. Professor Samuelson's research has focused on securities law and the management of lawyers (in both law firms and corporations). Her articles have appeared in the BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW, OHIO STATE LAW JOURNAL, and SLOAN MANAGEMENT REVIEW, among others. She practiced law in the corporate department of the law firm Choate, Hall, and Stewart. She earned both an AB and JD at Harvard University","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:821a0bd1ae2fa5ee267dd1f21d9384f797981de2","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Business+Law%2C+4th+Edition++Beatty%2C+Samuelson.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"821a0bd1ae2fa5ee267dd1f21d9384f797981de2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,26,11,209,174,47,165,238,38,125,209,242,29,147,132,247,151,152,29,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
