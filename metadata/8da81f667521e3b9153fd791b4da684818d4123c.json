Taking their cue from the slow, elastic beats that dominated Massive Attack's Blue Lines and adding elements of cool jazz, acid house, and soundtrack music, Portishead created an atmospheric, alluringly dark sound. The group wasn't as avant-garde as Tricky, nor as tied to dance traditions as Massive Attack; instead, it wrote evocative pseudo-cabaret pop songs that subverted their conventional structures with experimental productions and rhythms of trip-hop. As a result, Portishead appealed to a broad audience -- not just electronic dance and alternative rock fans, but thirtysomethings who found techno, trip-hop, and dance as exotic as worldbeat.\n\nFormat: CD\nReleased: 1994, 1997, 2008\nLabel: Island\nGenre: Electronic\nStyle: Trip-hop\nQuality: FLAC\n\nAlbums:\n\nDummy - 1994\n\nTracks:\n\n   1.
