Persons considers the film &quot;one of the formative forces of indie film.&quot;\n\nCarlos James Chamberlin wrote in March, 2004 at senseofcinema.com: &quot;ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s about time people started rendering unto Liquid Sky. Its long lipstick trace is smudged through much of indie cinema.&quot;\n\nLiquid Sky was produced and directed by Slava Tsukerman who, prior to making Liquid Sky, had a successful career as a documentary and TV film maker in the USSR and Israel. The screenplay was written by Tsukerman, his wife and ubiquitous co-producer Nina V. Kerova, and Anne Carlisle, who also enacted the film's two leading roles. The director of photography, Yuri Neyman, a Russian ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©migrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, was the DP and special effects expert. Anne Carlisle also wrote a novel based on the movie (same title, ISBN 0-385-23930-0) in 1987.\n\nThe music for the film was composed by Slava Tsukerman, Clive Smith and Brenda Hutchinson using the Fairlight CMI, the first digital sampler/synthesizer. Most of it was original, while some songs were interpretations of music by Carl Orff, Baroque composer Marin Marais, and others.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4ab312122c2af4ca11ebe017f846dffd421e365","amp;dn":"Liquid+Sky+%5B1982%5D+Slava+Tsukerman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4ab312122c2af4ca11ebe017f846dffd421e365","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,171,49,33,34,194,175,76,161,30,190,1,127,132,109,255,212,33,227,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
