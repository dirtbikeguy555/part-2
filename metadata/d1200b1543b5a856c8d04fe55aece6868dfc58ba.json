It is an exuberant, uniquely American exploration of the passions that make us humanâ€”and one of those rare books that renew the idea of what a novel can do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1200b1543b5a856c8d04fe55aece6868dfc58ba","amp;dn":"David+Foster+Wallace+-+Infinite+Jest","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1200b1543b5a856c8d04fe55aece6868dfc58ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,32,11,21,67,181,168,86,200,208,79,229,90,236,230,134,141,252,88,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
