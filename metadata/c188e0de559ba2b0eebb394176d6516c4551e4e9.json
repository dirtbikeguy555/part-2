She has aged beyond her years and feels her life is hopeless, having been cheated and betrayed many times in her past. Fantasizing about movies, she sees herself as an actress and decides to head for Hollywood, having got the idea from a movie magazine while recuperating in the hospital from a suicide attempt which resulted from another unhappy love affair. \n\nRobert (Michael Sarrazin), a desperate Hollywood citizen unsuccessfully trying to become a director, never doubting that he'll eventually make it. Robert and Gloria meet and decide to enter a dance marathon, one of the crazes of the thirties. The grueling dancing takes its toll on Gloria's already weakened spirit, and she tells Robert that she'd be better off dead, that her life is hopeless - all the while acting cruel and bitter, alienating those around her, trying to convince him to shoot her and put her out of her misery. After all, they shoot horses, don't they? \n\n\tJane Fonda\t... \tGloria Beatty\n\tMichael Sarrazin\t... \tRobert Syverton\n\tSusannah York\t... \tAlice LeBlanc\n\tGig Young\t... \tRocky\n\tRed Buttons\t... \tHarry 'Sailor' Kline\n\tBonnie Bedelia\t... \tRuby\n\tMichael Conrad\t... \tRollo\n\tBruce Dern\t... \tJames\n\tAl Lewis\t... \tTurkey\n\tRobert Fields\t... \tJoel Girard\n\tSevern Darden\t... \tCecil\n\tAllyn Ann McLerie\t... \tShirley 'Shirl' Clayton\n\tMadge Kennedy\t... \tMrs. Laydon\n\tJacquelyn Hyde\t... \tJackie\n\tFelice Orlandi\t... \tMario\n\nDirector: Sydney Pollack\n\nRuntime:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065088/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0065088/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCodecs: \n\nCD1:\n\n Video :  660 MB,  1668 Kbps,  23.976 fps,  640*272 (Unknown),  XVID = XVID Mpeg-4, \n Audio :  35 MB,  90 Kbps,  48000 Hz,  1 channels,  0x55 = Lame MP3,  VBR,\n\nCD2:\n\n Video :  657 MB,  1424 Kbps,  23.976 fps,  640*272 (Unknown),  XVID = XVID Mpeg-4,  \n Audio :  41 MB,  90 Kbps,  48000 Hz,  1 channels,  0x55 = Lame MP3,  CBR, \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c188e0de559ba2b0eebb394176d6516c4551e4e9","amp;dn":"They+Shoot+Horses%2C+Don%5C%27t+They+%281969%29+DVDRip+%28SiRiUs+sHaRe%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c188e0de559ba2b0eebb394176d6516c4551e4e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,136,224,222,85,155,162,176,238,187,57,65,118,214,81,108,69,81,228,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
