A full range of exercises, from basic to challenging, helps readers explore key concepts and push their understanding to new heights. Computational exercises and computer projects are also available. Reflecting many years of professors' feedback, this edition offers new examples, exercises, and applications, while incorporating advancements and discoveries in number theory made in the past few years.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nKenneth H. Rosen received his BS in mathematics from the University of MichiganÃ¢â‚¬â€Ann Arbor (1972) and his PhD in mathematics from MIT (1976). Before joining Bell Laboratories in 1982, he held positions at the University of ColoradoÃ¢â‚¬â€Boulder, The Ohio State UniversityÃ¢â‚¬â€Columbus, and the University of MaineÃ¢â‚¬â€Orono, where he was an associate professor of mathematics. While working at AT&amp;T Laboratories, he taught at Monmouth University, teaching courses in discrete mathematics, coding theory, and data security.\n\nDr. Rosen has published numerous articles in professional journals in the areas of number theory and mathematical modeling. He is the author of Elementary Number Theory, 6/e, and other books.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be7a53997aad36d7e3b72dd130055fedb0328e0c","amp;dn":"Elementary+Number+Theory+-+6th+Edition+-+Kenneth+H.+Rosen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be7a53997aad36d7e3b72dd130055fedb0328e0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,122,83,153,122,173,54,215,227,183,45,209,48,5,95,237,176,50,142,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
