The band is known for their heavy, modern, almost futuristic, and progressive sound that includes polyrhythmic patterns and soaring melodies. They are regarded as one of the pioneers of the djent movement in progressive metal.\n\nThe band consists of vocalist Spencer Sotelo, guitarists Misha Mansoor, Mark Holcomb, and Jake Bowen, drummer Matt Halpern, and bassist Adam &quot;Nolly&quot; Getgood. Periphery released their self-titled debut in 2010 and their follow-up, Periphery II: This Time It's Personal, on July 3, 2012. On December 3, 2013 Periphery released a teaser for their EP/mini-album &quot;Clear&quot;, which was released on January 28, 2014. All Periphery material is self produced by the members.\n\nJuggernaut is a concept which has been under development by the band for several years. Misha had initially written a series of demos early in Periphery's history, which were sections of a planned extended composition with the Juggernaut title; this extended composition contained Periphery's breakthrough song &quot;Icarus Lives&quot; as one of its sections. The idea of an extended piece was eventually scrapped and extended into a concept which would span an entire album.\n\nDuring the Periphery II album cycle it was planned that Juggernaut would be released 3Ã¢â‚¬â€œ6 months after Periphery II as part of a double album. However, this plan was also dropped due to Periphery's touring commitments, pushing the projected release back to 2015. A release during early 2015 is now expected, as the band pushed writing and pre-production even further back to allow for time to write and record Clear. As of early July 2014, Periphery began tracking and recording songs for Juggernaut.\n\nTracklist:\n\nAlpha:\n\nA Black Minute (4:16)\nMK Ultra (2:50)\nHeavy Heart (4:22)\nThe Event (1:45)\nThe Scourge (5:36)\nAlpha (5:31)\n22 Faces (3:52)\nRainbow Gravity (4:39)\nFour Lights (2:18)\nPsychosphere (6:16)\n\nOmega:\n\nReprise (1:25)\nThe Bad Thing (5:54)\nPriestess (5:04)\nGraveless (3:56)\nHell Below (3:43)\nOmega (11:44)\nStranger Things (7:35)\n\n\nGenre: Progressive\nSubgenre: Djent / Djazz\nBitrate: Others\nSize: 111.07 MB\nShow/Hide Files:\n17 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d312918baa4eab97d99ecf109f6669eabfbfc614","amp;dn":"Periphery+-+Juggernaut+Alpha+%26amp%3B+Juggernaut+Omega+%282015%29ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d312918baa4eab97d99ecf109f6669eabfbfc614","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,18,145,139,170,78,171,151,217,158,207,16,159,102,105,234,191,191,198,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
