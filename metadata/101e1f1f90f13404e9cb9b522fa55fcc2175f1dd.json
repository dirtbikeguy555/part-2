Despite her grief, as the only surviving member of her house, Mara must now take up the mantles of Ruling Lady. But she soon discovers betrayal at the heart of her family's loss, and the Acoma's enemies have brought her house to the brink of utter destruction.\n\nServant of the Empire - Nobody knows how to play the Game of the Council better than Mara of the Acoma. Through bloody political manoeuvring she has become a powerful force within the Empire; but surrounded by deadly rivals, Mara has to be the best simply to stay alive. But Lady Mara must contend with battles on two fronts: in the hotbed of intrigue and treachery that is the court of Tsurani; and in her heart, where her affection for a barbarian slave from the enemy world of Midkemia leads her to question the principles by which she lives.\n\nMistress of the Empire - Welcome to the final play of the game. Now revered as the Servant of the Empire, Mara of the Acoma is in more danger than ever before. Not only does she face threats from the brotherhood of assassins and the cunning spies of rival ruling houses, but she has attracted the attention of the awesome Assembly of Magicians, who see her as a threat to their power. But Mara has not reached her position through luck or accident of fate. Surrounded on all sides by enemies determined to bring her down, Mara must draw on her deepest resources to secure her place as Mistress of the Empire once and for all.\n\n\n\nRead by Tania Rodrigues\nFormat: MP3\nType: Unabridged\nNarrator: Tania Rodrigues\nQuality: 64 kbps / 1.0 Mono / 44100 hz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:101e1f1f90f13404e9cb9b522fa55fcc2175f1dd","amp;dn":"Raymond+E.+Feist+-+The+Empire+Trilogy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"101e1f1f90f13404e9cb9b522fa55fcc2175f1dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,30,31,31,144,241,52,4,233,203,155,82,47,165,95,204,33,117,241,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
