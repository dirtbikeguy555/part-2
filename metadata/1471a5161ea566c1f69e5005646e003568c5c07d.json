O'Neil \nFormat: PDF \nHardcover: 456 pages \nPublisher: Wiley; 3 edition (April 7, 2014) \nLanguage: English \nISBN: 978-1118629949 \n\n\nA broad introduction to PDEs with an emphasis on specialized topics and applications occurring in a variety of fields\n\nFeaturing a thoroughly revised presentation of topics, Beginning Partial Differential Equations, Third Edition provides a challenging, yet accessible, combination of techniques, applications, and introductory theory on the subjectof partial differential equations. The new edition offers nonstandard coverageon material including BurgerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s equation, the telegraph equation, damped wavemotion, and the use of characteristics to solve nonhomogeneous problems.\n\nThe Third Edition is organized around four themes: methods of solution for initial-boundary value problems; applications of partial differential equations; existence and properties of solutions; and the use of software to experiment with graphics and carry out computations. With a primary focus on wave and diffusion processes, Beginning Partial Differential Equations, Third Edition also includes:\n\n- Proofs of theorems incorporated within the topical presentation, such as the existence of a solution for the Dirichlet problem\n- The incorporation of MapleÃ¢â€žÂ¢ to perform computations and experiments\n- Unusual applications, such as PoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pendulum\n- Advanced topical coverage of special functions, such as Bessel, Legendre polynomials, and spherical harmonics\n- Fourier and Laplace transform techniques to solve important problems\n\nBeginning of Partial Differential Equations, Third Edition is an ideal textbook for upper-undergraduate and first-year graduate-level courses in analysis and applied mathematics, science, and engineering","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1471a5161ea566c1f69e5005646e003568c5c07d","amp;dn":"Beginning+Partial+Differential+Equations%2C+3rd+Edition+%2B+Solution","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1471a5161ea566c1f69e5005646e003568c5c07d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,113,165,22,30,165,102,193,246,158,80,5,100,110,0,53,104,197,192,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
