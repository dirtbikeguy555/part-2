To survive, the Colonists flee\nto the underground mines and build a network of habitable caves.\n\nFive years later, Darius Mason, grandson of Martian Revolution heroes\nAlec Mason and Samanya, runs a lucrative business from Bastion,\nunderground hub of Colonist activity. Mining, scavenging, mercenary\nwork--if the job is dangerous, Darius is your man. Few sane people now\nventure to the ravaged surface, aside from contractors like Darius and\nthe smugglers who run goods between the settlements.\n\nWhen Darius is tricked into reopening a mysterious shaft in an old\nMarauder temple, he releases a long-dormant evil and unleashes\nArmageddon on Mars. As Colonist and Marauder settlements are torn\nasunder, only Darius and the Red Faction can save mankind. The battle\nwill take them across the storm-blasted planet--and below it, to the\nvery heart of the unspeakable threat.\n\nRed Faction: Armageddon expands on the critically acclaimed,\nbest-selling franchise with new, groundbreaking challenges. You are\nhumanity's last hope for survival.\n\nFeatures:\n\nInfestation Mode - Survive waves of enemy hordes in a 1-4 player\ncooperative, objective-based experience.\n\nRuin Mode - Master the tools of destruction in competitive and casual\ndestruction-based modes.\n\nHell on Mars - Darius Mason can only watch as the surface of Mars is\ndestroyed. Seeking solace underground, an even greater threat emerges\nagainst humanity.\n\nNano Forge - Unleash the devastating force of the Nano Forge with\nmassive concussive blasts or reconstruct downed colonist defences with\nGeo-Mod 2.0.\n\nMartian Underground - The truth behind an ancient evil will force\nDarius to wage a battle across the devastated Martian surface, beneath\nmassive frozen glaciers, and over rivers of broiling magma.\n\nINSTALL NOTES\n\n1.
