Comprising some 1.8 million words, it is the longest known epic poem, roughly ten times the length of the Iliad and the Odyssey combined.  W. J. Johnson has compared the importance of the Mahabharata to world civilization to that of the Bible, the works of Shakespeare or Homer, Greek drama, or the Qur'an.\n\nThe epic relates the dynastic struggle between the PÃƒÂ¡ndava and the KÃƒÂ¡urava princes for the throne of Hastinapura, culminating in the great battle of Kurukshetra, in which the Pandavas are ultimately victorious.  It also contains philosophical and devotional material, such as a discussion of the four &quot;goals of life&quot; or purusharthas, and features innumerable sub-plots that accommodate fascinating meanderings and digressions.  Among the principal works and stories in the Mahabharata are the Bhagavad Gita, the story of Damayanti, an abbreviated version of the Ramayana, and the Rishyasringa, often considered as works in their own right.\n\nThe unabridged Penguin India edition consists of 8 of a projected 10-volume translation and is based on the Critical Edition compiled at the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute.  This lucid, nuanced and confident translation by Indian economist Bibek Debroy makes the Mahabharata marvellously accessible to contemporary readers.\n\nThe unabridged Clay Sanskrit Library edition, translated by various hands and issued by NYU Press (2005 - present), is projected to include 32 volumes when it is finally complete.  The translation is based not on the Critical Edition but on the version known to the commentator Nilakantha.\n\nMany condensed versions, abridgements and novelistic prose retellings of the complete epic have been published in English.  Three of these renderings -- by R. K. Narayan, Ramesh Menon and Devdutt Pattanaik -- are also included here.\n\n\nPENGUIN edition (Penguin India, 2010 - present).  -- ePUB format\nTranslated by Bibek Debroy.\n\n  * Vol. 1 (Sections 1-15)\n  * Vol. 2 (Sections 16-32)\n  * Vol. 3 (Sections 33-44)\n  * Vol. 4 (Sections 45-59)\n  * Vol. 5 (Sections 60-66)\n  * Vol. 6 (Sections 67-72)\n  * Vol. 7 (Sections 73-77)\n  * Vol. 8 (Sections 78-86)\n\n\nCLAY SANSKRIT LIBRARY edition (NYU Press, 2005 - present). -- PDF format\nVarious translators.\n\n  * Book II: The Great Hall.
