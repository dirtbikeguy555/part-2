This is the story of Smoakâ€™s first outing as the Nowhere Man, where after completing a mission in Northern California, he happens to spot a young woman at a coffee shop. Brutalized and under the control of a very powerful, unscrupulous man, her life is in danger if she doesnâ€™t escape. And the only person that can help her do that is a man with the background and skills of the Nowhere Man.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b31cdc1b6363f3f4d349acf7c8309f8a4cc47b49","amp;dn":"Buy+a+Bullet+-+Gregg+Hurwitz+%5BEN+EPUB+MOBI+AZW3%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b31cdc1b6363f3f4d349acf7c8309f8a4cc47b49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,28,220,27,99,99,243,244,211,73,172,247,200,48,159,138,76,196,123,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
