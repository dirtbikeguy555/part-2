Renfield is drugged by the eerily hypnotic count, and turned into one of his thralls, protecting him during his sea voyage to London. After sucking the blood and turning the young Lucy Weston into a vampire, Dracula turns his attention to her friend Mina Seward, daughter of Dr. Seward who then calls in a specialist, Dr. Van Helsing, to diagnose the sudden deterioration of Mina's health. Van Helsing, realizing that Dracula is indeed a vampire, tries to prepare Mina's fiance, John Harker, and Dr. Seward for what is to come and the measures that will have to be taken to prevent Mina from becoming one of the undead.\n\nIMDB:http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021814/\nWIKI:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracula_%281931_film%29\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 700 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 11mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 372 Kbps\nWriting application              : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nWriting library                  : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Custom\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 11mn\nBit rate                         : 1 236 Kbps\nWidth                            : 656 pixels\nHeight                           : 496 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4:3\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nResolution                       : 8 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.152\nStream size                      : 631 MiB (90%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 11mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 65.3 MiB (9%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 80 ms (2.00 video frames)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 504 ms\nWriting library                  : LAME3.98r\nEncoding settings                : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 -b 128\nLanguage                         : English\n\n[u][i][b]Please don't expect to get the movie in a few minutes, I only have limited bandwidth.
