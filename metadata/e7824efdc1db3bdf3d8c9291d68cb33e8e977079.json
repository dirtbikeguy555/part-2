Exanima's exceptional attention to detail and realistic simulation of all things aim to provide a deeply immersive and dynamic gameplay experience.\r\nThis game features a very deep, truly physics based combat system. This is not just some animation feature, it is a fundamental difference that is central to gameplay. Real momentum, forces and collisions are always at play here, every nuance of your inputs is crucial to the outcome. This will likely be unlike anything you've played before and may take some practice, but can be hugely rewarding and the skill cap is virtually infinite. It is not particularly fast paced or difficult but it does require you to pay attention, it is very tactical and just casually pressing buttons won't get you very far!\r\nA deep skill based combat system\r\nComplex and smart AI\r\nFully interactive environments\r\nAn advanced damage model with accurate collisions and locational protection\r\nRoguelike elements\r\nArena mode to hone your combat skills.\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: XP (SP3) / Vista / 7 / 8 / 10\r\nProcessor: Intel Core2 or AMD Athlon II dual core \r\nMemory: 2 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: Intel HD 4000 or AMD Radeon HD 2600 or Nvidia GeForce 8600 with 512MB VRAM \r\nStorage: 2 GB available space \r\nSound Card: Integrated audio \r\nMouse, Keyboard\r\n\r\nRecommended system requirements - Windows: XP (SP3) / Vista / 7 / 8 / 10\r\nProcessor: 3 Ghz Intel Core i5 quad core or 3.5 Ghz AMD FX hex core or better \r\nGraphics: AMD Radeon HD 5850 or Nvidia GeForce GTX 280 with 1GB VRAM or better \r\nAdditional Notes: Faster GPU with more VRAM recommended for very high settings or resolutions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7824efdc1db3bdf3d8c9291d68cb33e8e977079","amp;dn":"Exanima+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7824efdc1db3bdf3d8c9291d68cb33e8e977079","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,130,78,253,193,219,59,223,61,140,146,145,214,140,179,62,142,151,112,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
