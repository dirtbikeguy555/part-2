I'm no pro release group or anything, but I think this looks excellent, with no visible differences from the bluray source, but quite a bit less than the 60GB on the discs.  Keep this seeding, because it's getting hard to find this series anywhere, and this is the only torrent at 1080p.  Oh, and this is also done all kinds of High Profile h264, so no idea if this will play back on your PS3, xbox, phone, or whatever.  Works on a computer, use VLC, but seems to work on everything I've tried.  Also, if anyone has, or would be interested in creating, forced subtitles (i.e., just the untranslated signs and on-screen text), would be eternally grateful, I don't have time.  SEED!!!  And above all, enjoy.\n\nMatroska Container\n\nVideo details:\nCodec: h264 (x264 in handbrake)\nHorizontal Res: 1920 (Note this is a 4:3 anime, so the black bars on the sides are normal.
