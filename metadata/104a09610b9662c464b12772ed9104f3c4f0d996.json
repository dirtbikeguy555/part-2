True-peak limiting can also be used to ensure that down-stream Codecs (mp3, AAC etc.) do not introduce distortion into the signal.\n\n\nSupported Standards\n\nOur loudness products are compatible with all recommendations and guidance based upon the international standard ITU-R B.S. 1770, revisions 1, 2 and 3 including:\n\nATSC A/85 (CALM ACT)\nEBU R128\nARIB TR-B32\nOP-59\nAGCOM 219/9/CSP\nDPP\n\nAvailable formats\n\nsupport AAX, VST, AU and AudioSuite in both 64-bit and 32-bit versions. RTAS is also available as 32-bit only.\n\nMinimum System Specification\n\nMac OSX 10.6.x, 512 MB RAM\n\nWindows XP or above, 512 MB RAM\n\n\n    NuGen.Audio.LMCorrect.v1.2.1.Incl.Keygen-R2R\n    NuGen.Audio.LMCorrect.v1.2.1.MacOSX.Incl.Keygen-R2R\n\n\n\nLM-Correct gives you a unique, immediate and hassle-free route to loudness-compliant audio in your day-to-day loudness workflow, saving you time and preventing costly mistakes.\n\nEither within your NLE/DAW or as a stand-alone application, LM-Correct delivers automated compliance with True-Peak correction, solving your compliance issues on the spot. Used in conjunction with a real-time meter, LM-Correct saves iterative adjustments to the mix as you approach target levels, allowing transparent in-edit 'quick-touch' finishing of your audio. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an essential part of your loudness toolkit.\n\n\nSupported Standards\n\nOur loudness products are compatible with all recommendations and guidance based upon the international standard ITU-R B.S. 1770, revisions 1, 2 and 3 including:\n\nATSC A/85 (CALM ACT)\nEBU R128\nARIB TR-B32\nOP-59\nAGCOM 219/9/CSP\nDPP\n\nAvailable formats\n\nLM-Correct supports AudioSuite (AAX) in both 64-bit and 32-bit versions.

Adding stereo FX processing and using multiple mic. set-ups in the studio can introduce phase inconsistencies leading to Ã¢â‚¬ËœweakÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœhollowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ or Ã¢â‚¬ËœflatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ sounds.\n\nMonofilter lets you align and balance low frequencies with the minimum of effort, leaving you with the same sound, yet louder, more focussed and better defined. And with Monofilter you can be sure of great playback performance on systems with separate low-frequency handling, such as club PAs, live rigs, home cinema systems, HiFi, and 2.1 gaming systems.\n\nAvailable formats\n\nWe support AAX, VST, AU and AudioSuite in both 64-bit and 32-bit versions. RTAS is also available as 32-bit only.\n\nMinimum System Specification\n\nMac OSX 10.6.x, 512 MB RAM\nWindows XP or above, 512 MB RAM\n\n\n\nNuGen.Audio.MultiMonitor.v1.0.3.Incl.Keygen-R2R\n\n\n\nMultiMonitor provides the most powerful multi-channel loudness and true-peak metering available today. 16 meters, each capable of mono, stereo or 5.1 formats (thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s up to 96 simultaneous audio channels) give you individual True Peak and LUFS momentary displays. Every meter has a dedicated numeric Short Term and Integrated LUFS data display and meters can be colour-coded to aid grouping. Meters also feature a minimum and maximum short-term alerts function. MultiMonitor is fully compliant with CALM Act legislation, ITU-R BS1770/1, ATSC A/85, EBU R128 and other specific worldwide localisations.\n\nMultiMonitor is great for monitoring multiple playback sources or audio sub-groups simultaneously with 5.1 and stereo PGM output alongside the console in the audio control room. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ideal also in the MCR, monitoring multiple studios and formats simultaneously.\n\nSupported Standards\n\nMultiMonitor is compatible with all recommendations and guidance based upon the international standard ITU-R B.S. 1170, revisions 1, 2 and 3 including:\n\nATSC A/85 (CALM ACT)\nEBU R128\nARIB TR-B32\nOP-59\nAGCOM 219/9/CSP\nDPP\n\nAvailable formats\n\nWindows XP and above\n\nSSL LMS-16\n1RU PC + SSL Madi Xtreme 128 audio interface + GPI connectivity\n\nMinimum System Specification\n\nWindows XP or above, 512 MB RAM\n\n\n\n    NuGen.Audio.SEQ1.Master.Edition.v1.2.8.MacOSX.Incl.Keygen-R2R\n    NuGen.Audio.SEQ2.Master.Edition.v1.2.8.MacOSX.Incl.Keygen-R2R\n    NuGen.Audio.SEQ-S.v0.2.0.Incl.Keygen-R2R\n    NuGen.Audio.SEQ-S.v0.2.0.MacOSX.Incl.Keygen-R2R\n\n\n\nSEQ-S gives you powerful sonic sculpting and EQ matching up to 7.1, with stereo mid-side operation and automated spectrum analysis. Massage and correct any audio with incredible resolution that you just canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get with a traditional parametric interface.\n\nA direct-draw interface and detailed spectrum analysis make it easy to quickly identify and specifically fine-tune your audio. Couple this with EQ matching via sonic fingerprinting and you have some unique possibilities.\n\nAvailable formats\n\nWe support AAX, VST, AU and AudioSuite in both 64-bit and 32-bit versions.

You can tune each band into specific frequencies and move the frequency content around in the stereo sound stage. Just choose the position you want, and let Stereoplacer take care of preserving the balance of the original sounds.\n\nWith fully adjustable curves (bell, high and low shelving and even additional linked-harmonic overtones) you can redistribute stereo information with subtlety, or make powerful corrections Ã¢â‚¬â€œ even moving hard-panned frequencies from one side to the other Ã¢â‚¬â€œ without affecting the overall level balance of the material.\n\nAvailable formats\n\nWe support AAX, VST, AU and AudioSuite in both 64-bit and 32-bit versions.
