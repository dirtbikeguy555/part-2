Suitable for both beginners and advanced users, this easy-to-follow book begins with the basics and then systematically guides you through projects ranging from your first blinking LED through connecting Arduino to devices like game controllers or your iPhone.\n\nArduino is an open source do-it-yourself electronics platform that supports a mind-boggling collection of sensors and actuators you can use to build anything you can imagine. Even if you have never attempted a hardware project, this easy-to-follow book will guide you from your first blinking LED through connecting Arduino to your iPhone.\n\nArduino in Action is a hands-on guide to prototyping and building DIY electronics. You will start with the basics - unpacking your board and using a simple program to make something happen. Then, you will attempt progressively more complex projects as you connect Arduino to motors, LCD displays, Wi-Fi, GPS, and Bluetooth. You will explore input/output sensors, including ultrasound, infrared, and light, and then use them for tasks like robotic obstacle avoidance.\n\nArduino programs look a lot like C or C++, so some programming skill is helpful.\n\nWhat is Inside:\n\nGetting started with Arduino no experience required!\nWriting programs for Arduino\nSensing and responding to events\nRobots, flying vehicles, Twitter machines, LCD displays, and more!\n\nTable of Contents\nPart 1: Getting started\nChapter 1.
