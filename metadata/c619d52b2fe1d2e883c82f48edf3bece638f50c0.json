This series reveals how the world we live in today was entirely shaped by the railways, charting the glorious evolution of rail transportation and how it left its mark on our lives, landscape and culture. Hop aboard an old-fashioned locomotive and set off down the line to a new part of the country with the established stars of the BBC Two Farm series, Peter Ginn, Alex Langlands and Ruth Goodman who have immersed themselves in the story of how the railways made us what we are today. Our team of experts also get their hands dirty - driving the train, working in the station, manning the signal box and learning how to run every aspect of a 19th and early 20th century railway. This is a trip not to be missed.\r\n\r\n\r\n2)  Part 2 \r\nIn this episode they visit Beamish in County Durham, learning how the rail companies first realised there was money to be made in moving people rather than commodities. Then Peter and Alex live the life of navvies, the men who built the thousands of miles of tracks in all weather conditions, and Ruth finds out what impact the new railroads had on the cottage industries. She also learns about the role of the guard, and the trio learn what precautions were necessary for taking a long journey on a train that was yet to include the necessary facilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e3/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/47/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e8/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f8/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6c/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a0/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e2/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/06/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/29/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e5/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3e/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d0/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0d/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/45/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/92/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/11/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video: Bitrate: CRF-22 (~2817 Kbps)\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 161 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins,\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.22 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07lpglf","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c619d52b2fe1d2e883c82f48edf3bece638f50c0","amp;dn":"BBC+Full+Steam+Ahead+2of6+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c619d52b2fe1d2e883c82f48edf3bece638f50c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,25,213,43,47,225,210,232,131,200,47,72,237,243,190,206,99,143,80,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
