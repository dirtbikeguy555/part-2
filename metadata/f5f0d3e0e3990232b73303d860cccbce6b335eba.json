Greatest Hits\nThe Atlantic Years (2006)\n\n\nWhile they play around with the infectious grooves of reggae and Latin music as well as the heavy deliverance of hip-hop and rock, San Diego's hard rock four-piece P.O.D. has defined a universal message. They're born-again Christians and their faith takes a central place in their music.\n\nFormed in 1992 in the SoCal neighborhood of San Ysidro, Marcos (guitar) and Wuv (drums) relished the music they grew up on. San Ysidro or &quot;Southtown&quot; was a multicultural area, but working class. While Marcos and Wuv were fond of their jazz and reggae roots, they were young punks in the making. Both loved the gnarl of grunge and took to liking Green Day, Pennywise, Bad Brains, and the Vandals. They got a band together, P.O.D. (short for &quot;Payable on Death&quot;), with Wuv's hip-hop MC cousin, Sonny, and aimed for something real. Cleveland native Traa joined in 1993 and P.O.D. were on the map. \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nSource:\t\t\tWeb\nLabel:\t\t\tAtlantic/Rhino\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Southtown\n02.Boom\n03.Going In Blind\n04.Roots In Stereo\n05.Alive\n06.Youth Of The Nation\n07.Sleeping Awake\n08.Rock The Party (Off The Hook)\n09.Lights Out\n10.Goodbye For Now\n11.Execute The Sounds\n12.Will You\n13.Truly Amazing (From The Passion Of The Christ - Original Songs Inspired By The Film)\n14.Satellite\n15.Set Your Eyes To Zion\n16.Here We Go (Previously Unreleased)\n17.If It Wasn't For You\n\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5f0d3e0e3990232b73303d860cccbce6b335eba","amp;dn":"Payable+On+Death+-+P.O.D.+Greatest+Hits+%282006%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5f0d3e0e3990232b73303d860cccbce6b335eba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,240,211,224,227,153,2,50,183,51,3,216,96,204,203,206,107,51,94,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
