The installation window is in russian so i changed the language to english before installed it. It took like 1 or 2 hours but i can recommend it to everybody because i use a 256 onboard graphics card on a oldie laptop and the game loaded super fast. \n\nNo other installation i tried did this. \n\nEverything looks fine i also scanned it for viruses(no virus detected) so please don't be a negative guy and go ahead and try it. If you like the game buy it. :) It will save you time from wondering how to apply a patch on the game. I will update this torrent when i reach that fff elevator and inform you if it still has the glitch.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a340f06e29c60eecb125371299388a1f4e0d3013","amp;dn":"FEAR+2+-+PROJECT+ORIGIN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a340f06e29c60eecb125371299388a1f4e0d3013","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,64,240,110,41,198,14,236,177,37,55,18,153,56,138,31,78,13,48,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
