Though their music was initially categorised as progressive rock, they have since incorporated a combination of traditional Rock, pop and art rock into their music. The band's work is marked by the inventive songwriting of Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson, the distinctive voice of Hodgson, and the prominent use of Wurlitzer electric piano and saxophone in their songs.\n\nWhile the band's early work was mainstream progressive rock, they would enjoy greater critical and commercial success when they incorporated more conventional and radio-friendly elements into their work in the mid-1970s, going on to sell more than 60 million albums. They reached their peak of commercial success with 1979's Breakfast in America, which has sold more than 20 million copies.\n\nThough their albums were generally far more successful than their singles, Supertramp did enjoy a number of major hits throughout the 1970s and 1980s, including &quot;Bloody Well Right&quot;, &quot;Give a Little Bit&quot;, &quot;The Logical Song&quot;, &quot;Goodbye Stranger&quot;, &quot;Take the Long Way Home&quot;, &quot;Dreamer&quot;, &quot;Breakfast in America&quot;, &quot;It's Raining Again&quot;, and &quot;Cannonball&quot;. The band attained significant popularity in the United States, Canada, Europe, South Africa and Australia. Since Hodgson's departure in 1983, founder Rick Davies has led the band by himself.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEven in the Quietest MomentsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ is the fifth album by progressive rock band Supertramp, released in April 1977.\n\nThe album was recorded mainly at Caribou Ranch Studios in Colorado with overdubs, vocals and mixing completed at The Record Plant in Los Angeles and was Supertramp's first album to use engineer Peter Henderson, who would work with the band for their next three albums as well.\n\nEven in the Quietest Moments reached number 16 on the Billboard Pop Albums Charts in 1977, and within a few months of release became Supertramp's first Gold (500,000 copies or more) selling album in the US. In addition, &quot;Give a Little Bit&quot; became a US Top 20 single and reached number 29 on the UK Singles Chart. While &quot;Give a Little Bit&quot; was the big hit, both &quot;Fool's Overture&quot; and the title track also got a fair amount of FM album-rock play.[citation needed]\n\nA remastered CD version of the album with full original artwork, lyrics and credits restored (including the inner sleeve picture of the band absent from the original CD) was released on 11 June 2002 on A&amp;M Records in the US. The cover photo is not doctored Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a grand piano was placed on a mountain top at Eldora Mountain Resort (a ski area near Caribou Ranch Studios), covered with snow and photographed. The sheet music on the piano, though titled &quot;Fool's Overture&quot;, is actually the Star-Spangled Banner.\n\nIn 1978, Even in the Quietest Moments... was ranked 63rd in The World Critic Lists, which recognised the 200 greatest albums of all time as voted for by notable rock critics and DJs.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa9e97cd146b9c66e213711cee511a7f4883145a","amp;dn":"Supertramp%2FEven+In+The+Quietest+Moments+%5B2008%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa9e97cd146b9c66e213711cee511a7f4883145a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,158,151,205,20,107,156,102,226,19,113,28,238,81,26,127,72,131,20,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
