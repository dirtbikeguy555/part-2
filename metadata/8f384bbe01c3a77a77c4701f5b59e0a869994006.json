Every document from this era is an essential title to own no matter how obscure or fragmentary (and for some of the shows all we have are frustrating fragments).\r\n\r\nThe tape ends with the house announcer asking for William Combis, because â€œyour wallet is up hereâ€. The great thing about Zeppelin in the early years are the surprises and unique moments and riffs they pull out of their head and this concert is an excellent example of this. It was hoped more tape was found for this release but unfortunately that isnâ€™t the case.\r\n\r\nOrlando is one of the outstanding, but frustratingly incomplete, recordings from one of Zeppelinâ€™s greatest tours. It is a great recording to have for the collection, and this is a very good way to obtain the show.\r\n\r\nTracklist\r\n01. Introduction.flac\r\n02. Immigrant Song.flac\r\n03.

He visited record stores in London and demanded all Bootleg Led Zep copies be handed over.\r\nHe monitored crowds at Led Zeppelin concerts to locate bootleg recording equipment.\r\n\r\nAt one concert at Vancouver in 1971 he saw what he thought was recording equipment on the floor of the venue and personally destroyed it , only to find out later that the equipment was a noise pollution unit being operated by city officials to test the volume of the concert.\r\n\r\nAt the Bath Festival in 1970, he threw a bucket of water over unauthorised recording equipment. \r\nThese efforts failed to prevent the release of a torrent of Led Zeppelin bootlegs from the 1970s onwards","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f384bbe01c3a77a77c4701f5b59e0a869994006","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+Florida+Sunshine+1971+Flac+ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f384bbe01c3a77a77c4701f5b59e0a869994006","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,56,75,190,1,195,167,122,119,196,112,31,91,89,224,168,105,153,64,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
