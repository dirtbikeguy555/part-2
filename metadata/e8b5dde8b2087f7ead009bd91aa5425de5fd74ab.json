Unfortunately, we pay a price for bad habits that outweighs the immediate gratification that they bring.\n\nIn this book, Joyce Meyer starts by examining the nature of habits. The first habit - and most important one to have - is the God Habit. By making it a habit to start your day by reading the Bible and communing with God, asking for His help in your efforts and His strength and sustenance, the stage is set for overcoming the habits you want to break and establishing new ones in their place.\n\nShe then explores how to break bad habits by examining the destructive negative behavior patterns.\n\nThe author moves on to discuss fourteen good habits and devotes a chapter to each. By the end of the chapter, the reader has a specific roadmap to follow until the behavior has become automatic (the definition of a habit). It's like following a GPS to get you to a new place. After traveling the same route several times, the GPS isn't needed for you to find your destination. The 'habit' of following the right route is ingrained.\n\nAmong the habits discussed are:\nThe God Habit\nThe Habit of Being Decisive\nThe Health Habit\nThe Happy Habit\nThe Habit of Faith\nThe Habit of Excellence\nThe Habit of Being Responsible\nThe Generosity Habit\nThe Hurry Habit\nThe Discipline Habit\nThe Confidence Habit","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8b5dde8b2087f7ead009bd91aa5425de5fd74ab","amp;dn":"Making+Good+Habits%2C+Breaking+Bad+Habits+-+Joyce+Meyer.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8b5dde8b2087f7ead009bd91aa5425de5fd74ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,181,221,232,178,8,127,126,173,0,155,217,26,165,66,93,229,253,116,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
