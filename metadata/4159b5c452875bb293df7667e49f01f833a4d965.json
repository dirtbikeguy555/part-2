Fresh from a brief stay at a psych hospital, CamilleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first assignment from the second-rate daily paper where she works brings her reluctantly back to her hometown to cover the murders of two preteen girls. NASTY on her kneecap, BABYDOLL on her leg\nSince she left town eight years ago, Camille has hardly spoken to her neurotic, hypochondriac mother or to the half-sister she barely knows: a beautiful thirteen-year-old with an eerie grip on the town. Now, installed again in her familyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Victorian mansion, Camille is haunted by the childhood tragedy she has spent her whole life trying to cut from her memory. HARMFUL on her wrist, WHORE on her ankle\nAs Camille works to uncover the truth about these violent crimes, she finds herself identifying with the young victimsÃ¢â‚¬â€a bit too strongly. Clues keep leading to dead ends, forcing Camille to unravel the psychological puzzle of her own past to get at the story. Dogged by her own demons, Camille will have to confront what happened to her years before if she wants to survive this homecoming. \n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4159b5c452875bb293df7667e49f01f833a4d965","amp;dn":"Sharp+Objects+by+Gillian+Flynn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4159b5c452875bb293df7667e49f01f833a4d965","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,89,181,196,82,135,91,178,147,223,118,103,228,159,1,248,51,164,217,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
