That is, BIC provides up to date, accurate count of units in stock. Contrast a perpetual inventory control system with a periodic inventory control system where inventory counts are usually updated periodically at month, at quarter or at year end.\nBasic Inventory Control maintains a physical and available inventory count. Physical units in stock refer to products physically present on premises. Available units in stock includes physical units in stock as well as units on order. Further, BIC allows allocation of units for shipment. Allocated units are excluded from available units in stock but included in physical inventory.\nBasic Inventory Control automatically calculates the average unit cost of units as units enter and leave inventory. Average Costing method removes peaks and valleys in inventory cost as units acquired at high and low price levels average out.\nBasic Inventory Control provides customizable inventory and transactions report for cross-checking physical inventory with inventory recorded by Basic Inventory Control. Each inventory transaction is recorded providing a complete audit trail.\n\nSupported Operating Systems:\n\nWindows 7, Windows 8, Windows Vista, Windows XP\n\nHomepage: http://www.microguru.com/\n\nInstallation Instructions:\n\n- Install program. \n- Register application with given key.\n- Done, Enjoy.\n\nHave A Nice Day\n\nNote: Uploader is only responsible if any problem in torrent, never responsible for software functionality problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3ff82cde2857504de7ab072f4b1ce6be1c56c19","amp;dn":"Basic+Inventory+Control+v5.0.135+with+Key+%5BTorDigger%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3ff82cde2857504de7ab072f4b1ce6be1c56c19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,255,130,205,226,133,117,4,222,122,176,114,244,177,206,107,225,197,108,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
