His collaboration with the publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel led to the creation of the Voyages Extraordinaires, a widely popular series of scrupulously researched adventure novels including Journey to the Center of the Earth, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, and Around the World in Eighty Days.\n\nVerne is generally considered a major literary author in France and most of Europe, where he has had a wide influence on the literary avant-garde and on surrealism. His reputation is markedly different in Anglophone regions, where he has often been labeled a writer of genre fiction or children's books, not least because of the highly abridged and altered translations in which his novels are often reprinted.\n\nVerne is the second most translated author in the world (following Agatha Christie), and his works appear in more translations per year than those of any other writer.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:719c7d90f44ee52548f0221423ade49dae96064f","amp;dn":"Jules+Verne+E-Book+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"719c7d90f44ee52548f0221423ade49dae96064f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,156,125,144,244,78,229,37,72,240,34,20,35,173,228,157,174,150,6,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
