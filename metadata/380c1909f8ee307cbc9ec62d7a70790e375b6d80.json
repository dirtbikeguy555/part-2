Through which, we can attain the aim of \n   enabling students to have the experience of practical manipulation on a \n   largely-reduced cost.\n \n   Swan series NC simulation software can be furthere devided in 8 major types, \n   47 systems and 85 controlling panels. Equipped with FANUC, SIMUMERIK, \n   MITSUBISHI, GSK, HNC, KND, WA,SKY,HAAS,GREAT,RENHE,FAGOR,DASEN software, \n   swan NC simulation software can help students to learn operation of NC \n   milling tool, lathe and machining center of each system. Meanwhlie CAM NC \n   program can be programmed or read in by manual. By internet teaching, \n   teachers can have the first-hand information of their students current \n   operation information.  \n   \n  \n        \n\n Installation:\n  &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;\n  Check install.txt\n  \n\n        \n\n Greetz:\n  &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;\n  \n   \n\n        \n\n Contact Us:\n  &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:380c1909f8ee307cbc9ec62d7a70790e375b6d80","amp;dn":"Nanjing.Swansoft.CNC.Simulator.v6.45.Multilang-BEAN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"380c1909f8ee307cbc9ec62d7a70790e375b6d80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,12,25,9,248,238,48,124,188,158,198,45,122,112,121,14,55,91,109,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
