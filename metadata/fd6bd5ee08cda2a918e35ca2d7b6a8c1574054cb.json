The Stones were never as consistent on album as their main rivals, the Beatles, and Let It Bleed suffers from some rather perfunctory tracks, like &quot;Monkey Man&quot; and a countrified remake of the classic &quot;Honky Tonk Woman&quot; (here titled &quot;Country Honk&quot;). Yet some of the songs are among their very best, especially &quot;Gimme Shelter,&quot; with its shimmering guitar lines and apocalyptic lyrics; the harmonica-driven &quot;Midnight Rambler&quot;; the druggy party ambience of the title track; and the stunning &quot;You Can't Always Get What You Want,&quot; which was The Stones' &quot;Hey Jude&quot; of sorts, with its epic structure, horns, philosophical lyrics, and swelling choral vocals. &quot;You Got the Silver&quot; (Keith Richards' first lead vocal) and Robert Johnson's &quot;Love in Vain,&quot; by contrast, were as close to the roots of acoustic down-home blues as The Stones ever got.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://musicqwest.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/let-it.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://musicqwest.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/let-it.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n01 - Gimme Shelter\n02 - Love in Vain\n03 - Country Honk\n04 - Live with Me\n05 - Let It Bleed\n06 - Midnight Rambler\n07 - You Got the Silver\n08 - Monkey Man\n09 - You Can't Always Get What You Want","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd6bd5ee08cda2a918e35ca2d7b6a8c1574054cb","amp;dn":"The+Rolling+Stones+-+Let+It+Bleed+%5BMP3+320%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd6bd5ee08cda2a918e35ca2d7b6a8c1574054cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,107,213,238,8,205,162,169,24,227,92,162,215,182,168,193,87,64,84,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
