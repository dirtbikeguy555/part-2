As a singer, Bland projected a grainy, down-to-earth quality, punctuated with guttural growls and snorts that would come to be known as the 'chicken-bone sound.' Yet his voice was simultaneously smooth as velvet, allowing Bland to bring audiences under his hypnotic spell as he walked a fine line between passionate expression and exquisite self-control.\n\nBlandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s painstakingly crafted records featured his deliberate, resolute vocals set over a backdrop of dazzling horn fanfares, supple rhythm parts and Wayne Bennett's T-Bone Walker-style guitar. The quality of the records was stunning, and Bland's vocals were the centerpiece. He projected warmth and intimacy, but he could also growl and howl. As a measure of his considerable appeal to black audiences, Bland placed an amazing 51 singles on the R&amp;B Top 40.\n\nBobby Bland was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1981 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1992. In 1997, he received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. (rockhall.com)\n\n- - -\n\nBobby Bland - The Best of Bobby Blue Bland 1957-1974\n(Universal-Island 2008)\n\n 1. Farther Up the Road \n 2.
