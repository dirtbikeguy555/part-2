There's McCoy Tyner, Reggie Workman, Elvin Jones, and 16 others. It's heavy on brass, per the title, there are five french horns, for example. There are notable players like Eric Dolphy, Booker Little, Freddie Hubbard, and Julian Priester in the band, but the solos are by Coltrane, Tyner, or Jones. \r\n\r\nThe orchestration was done by Coltrane, Tyner, and Dolphy. The liner notes say Dolphy did a lot of it, later it came out Tyner did more (though Dolphy was no longer around to argue the point). It's not really a big band in the Duke Ellington style, but with all of the horns, it's certainly a big band. &quot;Africa&quot; is perhaps the best Coltrane song which isn't on his &quot;classic&quot; albums. \r\n\r\nIt's based on a steady, simple, bass and piano line, giving it a hypnotic, modal feel. The melody lines make the song stand out. &quot;Greensleeves&quot; has a catchy melody. It's very good, though Coltrane seems to be revisiting &quot;My Favorite Things&quot;. &quot;Blues Minor&quot; doesn't have the greatest title, and its melody isn't particularily catchy. However, John Coltrane is playing saxophone, and McCoy Tyner plays a great piano solo. I don't know how this short, original version of the album compares to the longer, more expensive, complete version. It's a very interesting John Coltrane CD, the only &quot;big band&quot; album he led. \r\n\r\nI recommend it for all Coltrane fans.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01.
