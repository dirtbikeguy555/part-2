She had a play that was to be produced at the New York International Fringe Festival and a job waiting for her at the New Yorker. Tragically, five days after graduation, Marina died in a car crash.\n\nAs her family, friends, and classmates, deep in grief, joined to create a memorial service for Marina, her unforgettable last essay for the Yale Daily News, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Opposite of Loneliness,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ went viral, receiving more than 1.4 million hits. She had struck a chord.\n\nEven though she was just twenty-two when she died, Marina left behind a rich, expansive trove of prose that, like her title essay, captures the hope, uncertainty, and possibility of her generation. The Opposite of Loneliness is an assemÃ‚Â­blage of MarinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s essays and stories that, like The Last Lecture, articulates the universal struggle that all of us face as we figure out what we aspire to be and how we can harness our talents to make an impact on the world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:070029785ead213e869bc93bcf1828a0d78e8064","amp;dn":"The+Opposite+of+Loneliness+-+Marina+Keegan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"070029785ead213e869bc93bcf1828a0d78e8064","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,0,41,120,94,173,33,62,134,155,201,59,207,24,40,160,215,142,128,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
