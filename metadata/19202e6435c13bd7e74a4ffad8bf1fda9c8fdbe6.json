Born in Odense, ÃƒËœrsted has pursued music since she received a Spice Girls CD when she was ten years old. As she matured, her influences matured too, with the likes of Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Sonic Youth, and The Smashing Pumpkins inspiring her electro indie pop sound. She soon took to writing her own music and in 2012 she was invited to appear at the CMJ music showcase in New York, where she garnered positive reviews. The following year, ÃƒËœrsted released the single &quot;Pilgrim,&quot; which showcased her beat-driven music alongside glitchy electronics and sparse guitar melodies that underpinned her sultry vocals. Later in 2013 her popularity rose after her voice appeared on Avicii's track, and again on the back of second single &quot;XXX 88,&quot; which featured Diplo and garnered comparisons to contemporaries AlunaGeorge and Grimes. Her eagerly anticipated debut full-length, No Mythologies to Follow, was expected in 2014.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19202e6435c13bd7e74a4ffad8bf1fda9c8fdbe6","amp;dn":"MO+-+No+Mythologies+to+Follow+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19202e6435c13bd7e74a4ffad8bf1fda9c8fdbe6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,32,46,100,53,193,59,215,231,74,79,250,216,191,31,218,156,143,219,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
