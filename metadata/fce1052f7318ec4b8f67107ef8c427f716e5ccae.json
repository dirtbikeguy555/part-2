Instead of promising the normal dose of quick fixes, Ramsey offers a bold, no-nonsense approach to money matters, providing not only the how-to but also a grounded and uplifting hope for getting out of debt and achieving total financial health.\n \n \nRamsey debunks the many myths of money (exposing the dangers of cash advance, rent-to-own, debt consolidation) and attacks the illusions and downright deceptions of the American dream, which encourages nothing but overspending and massive amounts of debt. &quot;Don't even consider keeping up with the Joneses,&quot; Ramsey declares in his typically candid style. &quot;They're broke!&quot;\n \n \nThe Total Money Makeover isn't theory. It works every single time. It works because it is simple. It works because it gets to the heart of the money problems: you.\n \n \n \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fce1052f7318ec4b8f67107ef8c427f716e5ccae","amp;dn":"The+Total+Money+Makeover+by+Dave+Ramsey+%5BQwerty80%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fce1052f7318ec4b8f67107ef8c427f716e5ccae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,225,5,47,115,24,236,75,143,103,16,126,248,196,39,247,22,229,204,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
