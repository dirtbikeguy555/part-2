Maybe a bit of advertising down the local church wouldn&amp;#039;t do any harm. Will Del understand the ethics involved? \n\nDespite knocking the price down to a mere six quid, Del Boy can&amp;#039;t shift his telescopic Christmas trees (lights, bangles, beads and baubles inclusive). He only has 149 more to sell to make a tidy profit.\nStuck for a solution the Trotters decamp to Sid&amp;#039;s burger van. Del&amp;#039;s conscience seems to get the better of him, and he tells Rodney and Grandad what a shame it is that the market traders can&amp;#039;t afford to donate a tree to the local church this year. Especially the little orphans.\nLeft to guard the trees, Rodney steals away to the church.\nThe Vicar quickly debunks Del&amp;#039;s story, and Rodders realises the tale was a scam to get an endorsement from The Church of England.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00923189aabf80d52c2df79ee9f1a15a400cbfd7","amp;dn":"Only+Fools+and+Horses+Season+2-OnlyMe1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00923189aabf80d52c2df79ee9f1a15a400cbfd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,146,49,137,170,191,128,213,44,45,247,158,233,241,161,90,64,12,191,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
