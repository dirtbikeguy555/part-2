During its time as a record company, Paramount recorded thousands of records by some of the biggest names in the business including Louis Armstrong, Ma Rainey, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Ethel Waters and many more. Unfortunately, no one at Paramount kept a proper record or archive of the music in the studio. Third Man and Revenant Records have come together and compiled a large collection of Paramount recordings in a two volume set. The process took over two years and a team of 30 to 50 people to finish. The collection will be released in a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Handcrafted quarter-sawn oak cabinet with lush sage velvet upholstery and custom-forged metal hardware.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ It features 800 remastered songs, six-180g vinyl records, over 200 restored original 1920s ads and images, and two books. The first book is the history of Paramount and the second is a 360 page encyclopedia guide to the Paramount artists. The set will also include a USB drive containing music and images from the Paramount collection. The vinyl LPs will have 87 songs spread across the six records.\n\nDean Blackwood, co-founder of Revenant Records, told Rolling Stone about putting together the history of Paramount and sharing it with Jack White Ã¢â‚¬Å“That was really the revelatory moment, just sort of staring at that timeline on my wall, like, Ã¢â‚¬ËœWhy hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t this story been told?Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n   VA - The Rise &amp; Fall of Paramount Records, Volume 1 (1917-1927)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Various Artists\nAlbum................: The Rise &amp; Fall of Paramount Records, Volume 1 (1917-1927)\nGenre................: Blues/Jazz\nSource...............: USB DRIVE\nYear.................: 2013\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.98\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\nTags.................: ID3 v1.0, ID3 v2.3\nInformation..........: \n\nI've upped this in a zip/rar due to the sheer volume of files and the file name length.
