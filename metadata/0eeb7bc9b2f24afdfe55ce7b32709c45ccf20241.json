The classic synthesizer parts for modulation are LFOs and Envelopes. The Ã¢â‚¬Ëœhuman inputÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is the keyboard we play and controllers like pitch bend or modulation wheel. A XY pad is perfect for the human input, but it controls only the filter and volume... We found this to be too limited. We wanted also to control the Ã¢â‚¬ËœharmonicsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ of the oscillator...changing the waveform using the XY pad.\n\n\nCompatibility\n\n    PC: 32 &amp; 64 bits VST for Windows XP / Vista / Windows 7 / Windows 8\n    Mac: 32 &amp; 64 bits AU and VST and 32 bit AAX, RTAS for OSX 10.5 or higher\n    Mac: AAX for OSX 10.5 or higher\n    Mac: 32 bit AU, VST &amp; RTAS for OSX 10.4 (Tiger)\n\n\n\nRob Papen Punch v1.0.3d\nR2R | 25.11.2012 | 257.7 MB\n\nWith Punch, Rob Papen delivers a brand new speaker busting, body rattling software instrument.

The sound sets are clean sampled guitars, which gives you great freedom and flexibility when using the synthesizer features and effects of RG.\n\n\nCompatibility\n\n    PC: 32 &amp; 64 bits VST and RTAS for Windows XP / Vista / Windows 7/ Windows 8\n    Mac: 32 &amp; 64 bits AU and VST and 32 bit AAX, RTAS for OSX 10.5 or higher\n    Mac: 32 bit AU, VST &amp; RTAS for OSX 10.4 (Tiger)\n    \n\n\nRob Papen Predator v1.6.3b\nR2R | 25.11.2012 | 60.8 MB\n\nPredator is a &quot;phat sounding&quot; killer synthesizer that combines inspiring presets and first-class features to make this your 'go-to' synth for contemporary music production.\nThe user interface has been designed so that almost all controls are visible on screen, making it fun and incredibly easy-to-use.
