Diabetes UK, founded as the Diabetic Association by\nDr RD Lawrence and his patient HG Wells in 1934 (later the\nBritish Diabetic Association), has uniquely supported both\npatients and their needs as well as clinical and scientific\nresearch. More recently the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation has\nmade substantial contributions. Furthermore the\npharmaceutical industry has been both innovative in its own\nlaboratories as well as supportive of both patients and clinicians.\nIt gives particular pleasure to reproduce some parts of the\npersonal account by Mrs B-J (with her permission) of her own\ndiabetes over the last 70 years of attendances at KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s College\nHospital. She describes vividly aspects of treatment and some of\nthe problems faced by people with diabetes, and one can see\nclearly how many improvements there have been during her\nlifetime. Her account should give tremendous encouragement\nto those now starting on their own life with diabetes.\nThe ABC is intended as a strictly practical guide to the\nmanagement of diabetes and its complications and is directed\nto all those doctors, nurses, and health professionals, other\nthan established specialists, who see diabetic patients, and\nmedical students should find some value in its pages. Many of\nthe innovations of the end of the 20th century are described in\nthis fifth edition of the ABC in the hope that it will help in the\ndelivery of the very best standards of care to those who need it\nin the 21st century","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:862d066bdb447560b6f1c846e24d85e8c575e420","amp;dn":"ABC+Of+Diabetes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"862d066bdb447560b6f1c846e24d85e8c575e420","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,45,6,107,219,68,117,96,182,241,200,70,226,77,133,232,197,117,228,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
