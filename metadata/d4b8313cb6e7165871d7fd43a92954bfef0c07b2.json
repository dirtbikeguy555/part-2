The odds are also good that they are intelligent, confident, and articulateÃ¢â‚¬â€the center of attention. They make you laugh and they make you think. The odds are also that this spell didn't last.\n\n Narcissists are everywhere. There are millions of them in the United States alone: entertainers, politicians, business people, your neighbors. Recognizing and understanding them is crucial to your not being overtaken by them, says Jeffrey Kluger, in his provocative new book about this insidious disorder.\n\n With insight and wit, Kluger frames the surprising new research on narcissism and explains the complex, exasperating personality disorder. He reveals how narcissism and narcissists affect our lives at work and at home, on the road, and in the halls of government; what to do when we encounter narcissism; and how to neutralize its effects before it's too late.\n\n As a Time writer and science editor, Kluger knows how to take science's new ideas and transform them into smart, accessible insights. Highly readable and deeply engaging, this book helps us understand narcissism and narcissists more fully.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4b8313cb6e7165871d7fd43a92954bfef0c07b2","amp;dn":"The+Narcissist+Next+Door%3A+Understanding+the+Monster+%282014%29epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4b8313cb6e7165871d7fd43a92954bfef0c07b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,184,49,60,182,231,22,88,113,215,253,67,169,41,84,191,239,12,7,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
