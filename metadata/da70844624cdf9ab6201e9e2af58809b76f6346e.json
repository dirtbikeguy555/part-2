At first it seems as though it is all going to be great fun; but the fun before long becomes furious and life on the island turns into a nightmare of panic and death. As ordinary standards of behaviour collapse, the whole world the boys know collapses with themÃ¢â‚¬â€the world of cricket and homework and adventure storiesÃ¢â‚¬â€and another world is revealed beneath, primitive and terrible. Lord of the Flies remains as provocative today as when it was first published in 1954, igniting passionate debate with its startling, brutal portrait of human nature. Though critically acclaimed, it was largely ignored upon its initial publication. Yet soon it became a cult favorite among both students and literary critics who compared it to J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye in its influence on modern thought and literature.\n\nLabeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse, Lord of the Flies has established itself as a true classic.\n\n-------------\n\n56kbps, .mp3, unabridged, read by Martin Jarvis.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da70844624cdf9ab6201e9e2af58809b76f6346e","amp;dn":"Lord+of+the+Flies+by+William+Golding","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da70844624cdf9ab6201e9e2af58809b76f6346e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,112,132,70,36,205,249,171,98,1,233,226,175,88,128,155,118,246,52,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
