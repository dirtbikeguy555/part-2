Maintaining that such relocation is inevitable, the author further argues that planetary science is of practical utility, fostering an interdisciplinary approach to looming environmental catastrophes such as &quot;nuclear winter&quot; (lethal cooling of Earth after a nuclear war, a widely accepted prediction first calculated by Sagan in 1982). His exploration of our place in the universe is illustrated with photographs, relief maps and paintings, including high-resolution images made by Voyager 1 and 2, as well as photos taken by the Galileo spacecraft, the Hubble Space Telescope and satellites orbiting Earth, which show our planet as a pale blue dot. A worthy sequel to Sagan's Cosmos. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Pale-Blue-Dot-Bookcassette-Multi-track/dp/1561006173&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Pale-Blue-Dot-Bookcassette-Multi-track/dp/1561006173&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:509dc9cea9f7ca02ee383d0181b270b0f288e27b","amp;dn":"Carl+Sagan+-+Pale+Blue+Dot","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"509dc9cea9f7ca02ee383d0181b270b0f288e27b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,157,201,206,169,247,202,2,238,56,61,1,129,178,112,176,242,136,226,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
