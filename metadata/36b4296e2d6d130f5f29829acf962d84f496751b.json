They have devoted themselves to learning old songs and tunes, their performances reflect the values of innovation as much as tradition. They play traditional instruments like the Igil, a two-stringed fiddle. Throat singing is a technique which allows a singer to sing two or three notes at the same time. The people of Tuvan were able to develop five different ways of producing this particular type of singing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1993] 60 Horses in my Herd\n[mp3 vbr 230kbps stereo]\n\n[1994] The Orphan&amp;#039;s Lament\n[mp3 vbr 170kbps joint stereo]\n\n[1996] Fly, Fly My Sadness (with The Bulgarian Voices Angelite)\n[mp3 cbr 256kbps joint stereo]\n\n[1997] If I&amp;#039;d been born an Eagle\n[mp3 vbr 150kbps stereo]\n\n[1998] Mountain Tale (with The Bulgarian Voices Angelite &amp; Moscow Art Trio)\n[mp3 cbr 192kbps stereo]\n\n[1999] Where Young Grass Grows\n[mp3 vbr 160kbps joint stereo]\n\n[2001] Best - Live (Live 1)\n[mp3 vbr 150kbps joint stereo]\n\n[2002] More Live (Live 2)\n[mp3 vbr 170kbps joint stereo]\n\n[2002] Spirits from Tuva (Huun-Huur-Tu remixed)\n[mp3 cbr 320kbps stereo]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36b4296e2d6d130f5f29829acf962d84f496751b","amp;dn":"Huun-Huur-Tu+-+Throat+singing+from+Tuva","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36b4296e2d6d130f5f29829acf962d84f496751b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,180,41,110,45,109,19,15,95,41,130,154,207,150,45,132,244,150,117,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
