The difference is\ninaudible on non-surround speakers.\n\nEnjoy and please keep seeding it! I also appreciate comments and \nupvotes on TPB and KickassTorrents :)\n\n\n\n\n--\nSearch terms (since TPB's tag system apparently doesn't work properly at all):\nStar Trek The Next Generation\nSeason 2\nThe Next Generation\nBlu-Ray\nBlu Ray","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:662af66d9cc90a14b9d7bb95a99a219b3d313fb4","amp;dn":"Star.Trek.TNG.S01.720p.BRRip.x264-kris33+%28+Star+Trek+The+Next+Ge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"662af66d9cc90a14b9d7bb95a99a219b3d313fb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,42,246,109,156,201,10,20,185,215,187,149,169,154,33,155,61,49,63,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
