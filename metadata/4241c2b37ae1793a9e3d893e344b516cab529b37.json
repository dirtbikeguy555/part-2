Millions of students worldwide have explored calculus through Stewartâ€™s trademark style, while instructors have turned to his approach time and time again. In the Eighth Edition of CALCULUS, Stewart continues to set the standard for the course while adding carefully revised content. The patient explanations, superb exercises, focus on problem solving, and carefully graded problem sets that have made Stewartâ€™s texts best-sellers continue to provide a strong foundation for the Eighth Edition. From the most unprepared student to the most mathematically gifted, Stewartâ€™s writing and presentation serve to enhance understanding and build confidence.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nThe late James Stewart received his M.S. from Stanford University and his Ph.D. from the University of Toronto. He did research at the University of London and was influenced by the famous mathematician George Polya at Stanford University. Stewart was most recently Professor of Mathematics at McMaster University, and his research field was harmonic analysis. Stewart was the author of a best-selling calculus textbook series published by Cengage Learning, including CALCULUS, CALCULUS: EARLY TRANSCENDENTALS, and CALCULUS: CONCEPTS AND CONTEXTS, as well as a series of precalculus texts. \r\n\r\nFile Size: 126807 KB\r\nPrint Length: 1368 pages\r\nPublisher: Cengage Learning; 008 edition (May 19, 2015)\r\nPublication Date: May 19, 2015\r\nSold by: Cengage Learning\r\nLanguage: English\r\nASIN: B00YHKU50E\r\n\r\nISBN-10: 1285740629\r\nISBN-13: 978-1285740621","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4241c2b37ae1793a9e3d893e344b516cab529b37","amp;dn":"Calculus+-+James+Stewart+-+8th.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4241c2b37ae1793a9e3d893e344b516cab529b37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,65,194,179,122,225,121,58,158,61,137,62,52,75,81,108,171,82,155,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
