You probably didnt learn to drive just because you thought seatbelts and turn signals were cool; Im betting you wanted to be able to get around in a car. People use SketchUp so that they can build 3D models. As such, most of this book focuses on what you can do with SketchUp, and not what SketchUp does.\n\nAuthor: Aidan Chopra\nTitle: Google Sketchup 8 For Dummies\nPublisher: Wiley Publishing\nYear: 2011\nFormat: PDF\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
