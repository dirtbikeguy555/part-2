Before you can sing &amp;#039;Fa-la-la-la-lah&amp;#039;, he decks the halls with howls of folly in there perennial favourite National Lampoon&amp;#039;s Christmas Vacation.\nSeeing is believing. There are 25,000 lights on the roof. An exploding turkey on the dining room table. A SWAT team taking siege outside. A festive supporting cast (including Beverly D&amp;#039;Angelo, Randy Quaid, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Juliette Lewis, William Hickey and more). And a John Hughes script full of wit, heart and sheer goofiness.
