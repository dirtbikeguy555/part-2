The primary obstacle is a conflict thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s built into our brains, say Chip and Dan Heath, authors of the critically acclaimed bestseller Made to Stick. Psychologists have discovered that our minds are ruled by two different systemsÃ¢â‚¬â€the rational mind and the emotional mindÃ¢â‚¬â€that compete for control. The rational mind wants a great beach body; the emotional mind wants that Oreo cookie. The rational mind wants to change something at work; the emotional mind loves the comfort of the existing routine. This tension can doom a change effortÃ¢â‚¬â€but if it is overcome, change can come quickly.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:213d9454c212e0f5f2e2a5d29b76c91f1d38e48a","amp;dn":"Switch%3A+How+to+Change+Things+When+Change+Is+Hard","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"213d9454c212e0f5f2e2a5d29b76c91f1d38e48a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,61,148,84,194,18,224,245,242,226,165,210,155,118,201,31,29,56,228,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
