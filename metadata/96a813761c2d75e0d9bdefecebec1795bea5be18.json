Then again, few songs have aged more poorly than the clumsy protest anthems &quot;Share The Land,&quot; &quot;Hand Me Down World,&quot; and\nthe pretentious, Psalm-quoting &quot;Hang On To Your Life.&quot; (Michael Hill's well-researched liner notes show the group craving the FM radio cache' these message songs brought.)\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.These eyes                                           [03:48]\n02.Laughing                                             [02:46]\n03.Undun                                                [03:29]\n04.No time                                              [03:50]\n05.American woman                                       [05:10]\n06.No sugar tonight. new mother nature                  [04:54]\n07.Hand me down world                                   [03:30]\n08.Share the land                                       [03:56]\n09.Hang on to your life                                 [04:13]\n10.Albert flasher                                       [02:30]\n11.Rain dance                                           [02:48]\n12.Sour suite                                           [04:09]\n13.Heartbroken bopper                                   [04:56]\n14.Guns, guns, guns                                     [05:04]\n15.Follow your daughter home                            [03:44]\n16.Star baby                                            [02:44]\n17.Clap for the wolfman                                 [04:20]\n18.Dancin' fool                                         [03:27]\n____\n\n69:18 min\n101,7 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
