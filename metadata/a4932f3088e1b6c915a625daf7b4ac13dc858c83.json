And for the next several hours, we'll be giving you the most structured, well-rounded, and easiest to follow 3ds Max training that you'll be able to find anywhere.\n\nIn the first portion of this tutorial, we'll be getting you familiar with some of the vocabulary and foundational skills that you'll need in order to begin moving around and working in 3ds Max. From there, we'll move into exploring some of the modeling features found in 3ds Max, and we'll begin building the aircraft that will be our central project for the remainder of this training.\n\nFrom there, we'll take you through the entire process of adding textures and materials to the vehicle, adding animated movement and animation controls, adding dynamics, and finally we'll learn how to add lights, shadows, and output our final animated sequence.\n\nNow this tutorial is designed for new 3ds Max users, so our goal is not to weigh you down with a lot of technical information. Instead, we want you to form some really good habits and workflows ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ getting to see the entire start-to-finish pipeline for this project ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ and by the end of this tutorial, we want you to be at a point where you can feel very comfortable using 3ds Max.\n\nLessons\n1.
