His next move? A mostly instrumental, orchestral jazz-soul soundtrack, for the forgotten 1972 film Trouble Man. The album, though a surprise to followers, was a hit, producing a top 10 pop title track and legions of new fans, including musicians who started the acid-jazz movement from its bones.\n\nFor Trouble ManÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 40th anniversary, Universal Music releases an extraordinary exploration of MarvinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s creative leap: a two-CD expanded edition that features not only the original soundtrack album remastered but 29 unreleased performances including alternate takes, rare vocals and--for the first time ever--the full score for the film. Until the hardly-seen film was repeated on television and issued on DVD in the last decade, many fans were unaware that GayeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s film score and soundtrack album contained different music. They are now together, giving fans double the musical experience.\n\nTrouble Man: 40th Anniversary Expanded Edition follows the tradition of previous Marvin Gaye reissues, by adding a beautiful digipak package that includes a 28-page booklet with photo outtakes, dozens of rare picture sleeves from around the world, and richly detailed text and track-by-track annotations. The setÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s main essay by musicologist Dr. Andrew Flory tells the long-overlooked story behind the album, while various sidebar and additional essays include commentary from film directors Cameron Crowe and George Tillman, Jr., and artists Lenny Kravitz, Joni Mitchell and Christian McBride.
