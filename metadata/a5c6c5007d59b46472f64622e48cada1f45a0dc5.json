Description from Wikipedia below:\n\n&quot;Music Sounds Better with You&quot; is a 1998 single by the short-lived house music band Stardust. The vocal performance of the song was provided by Benjamin Diamond of the band. The song uses a sample of the song &quot;Fate&quot; by Chaka Khan. It was also one of the highest-selling singles of the year in the UK, where it debuted at #2 and maintained the position for two weeks.\n\nThis is the only single released by the Stardust project. Alan Braxe, Thomas Bangalter (one half of Daft Punk) and Diamond never collaborated again.\n\nThis song was later used by Daft Punk for their live album Alive 2007, which features &quot;Music Sounds Better with You&quot; in the encore along with elements of &quot;One More Time&quot;, &quot;Human After All&quot; and &quot;Together&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5c6c5007d59b46472f64622e48cada1f45a0dc5","amp;dn":"Stardust+-+Music+Sounds+Better+With+You+CDM+%28vorbis%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5c6c5007d59b46472f64622e48cada1f45a0dc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,198,197,0,125,89,180,100,114,246,70,34,228,140,173,161,244,90,13,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
