Between them lies a dead man loosely clutching a hand-held tape player and a handgun. Each finds a tape the perfect fit for the player in their back pocket. They play the tapes. One is threatened, the other isn't. But they have a task: One must kill the other by 6:00, or his wife and daughter will die. They find hacksaws in a toilet, and try to cut the chains, but it doesn't work. They are the two newest victims of the Jigsaw Killer. In a flashback, we learn of Amanda, a girl who falls victim to the Jigsaw Killer. On her head is a mask, which is hooked into her lower jaw. There is a timer on it. Only one key will unlock it, and that key is in the digestive tract of her cell mate who lies paralyzed on the opposite side of the room. If she doesn't unlock the mask in time, her lower jaw will be ripped wide open... \n\nMore movie info: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387564/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387564/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenre....: Crime | Horror | Mystery\nActors:..: Leigh Whannell-Cary Elwes-Danny Glover-Ken Leung\nSource...: Bluray  1080p\nContainer: Mkv\nVideo....: AVC x264 1280x688 2012kbps 23.976fs\nAudio....: English AC3 48KHz 6ch 384Kbps\nRuntime..: 01:42\nFilesize.: 1.72GB\nSubtitle.: English (.srt file)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSaw 2 2005\n\nStoryline:\nWhen detective Eric Matthews is called to a crime scene of a victim of Jigsaw, he finds a lead to the place where he is hidden.
