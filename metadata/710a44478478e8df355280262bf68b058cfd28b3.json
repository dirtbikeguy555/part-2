Suffused with Munro's clarity of vision and her unparalleled gift for storytelling, these stories (set in the world Munro has made her own: the countryside and towns around Lake Huron) about departures and beginnings, accidents, dangers, and homecomings both virtual and real, paint a vivid and lasting portrait of how strange, dangerous, and extraordinary the ordinary life can be.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:710a44478478e8df355280262bf68b058cfd28b3","amp;dn":"Dear+Life+-+Alice+Munro.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"710a44478478e8df355280262bf68b058cfd28b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,10,68,71,132,120,232,223,53,82,128,38,43,246,139,5,140,253,40,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
