Billy's vivid, real-time account of his on-going journey through the mysteries of death will change the way you think about life. Death and your place in the Universe.\n\nIn his foreword, Dr. Raymond Moody, author of Life after Life, explains the phenomena of walkers between the worlds, known to us since ancient times, and says that Dr. Kagan's thought-provoking account is an excellent example.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:684c21773690e97836ec3caef930a2ca1f9789e1","amp;dn":"The+Afterlife+of+Billy+Fingers+-+Annie+Kagan+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"684c21773690e97836ec3caef930a2ca1f9789e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,76,33,119,54,144,233,120,54,236,60,174,249,48,162,202,31,151,137,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
