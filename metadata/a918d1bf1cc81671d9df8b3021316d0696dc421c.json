I'll just say this is a must watch, tough you might not want to watch it when you're deep in melancholia.\n\nSNAPSHOTS :\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/1aceb7185607627&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/1aceb7185607627&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/036ce3185607687&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/036ce3185607687&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/d038c5185607741&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/d038c5185607741&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/8b5a5c185607779&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/8b5a5c185607779&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/134978185607802&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imagebam.com/image/134978185607802&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical aspects :\n\nThe video was encoded according to AVCHD specifications so I guess a DVD-R readable by your Blu-Ray player is doable.\n\nPicture :\n\nThe source is HD DVB-T, tough the quality was inferior to a potential BluRay, yet still much better than DVD (also the TV logo wasn't broadcasted!).\n\nVery few and almost unnoticable imperfections because of the reception (which was close to perfect), they should not be a concern.\n\nx264-720p\n\nSUBTITLES INCLUDED:\nDanish\nDutch\nCzech\nEnglish\nFinnish\nFrench\nGreek\nHungarian\nKroatian\nNorwegian\nPolish\nPortuguese\nRumanian\nSlovenian (or Slovak sorry, not sure)\nSerbian\nSpanish\nSwedish\nTurkish\n\nKorean subs can be found, but I was unqualified to synch them (do it yourself and link for others if you're interested).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a918d1bf1cc81671d9df8b3021316d0696dc421c","amp;dn":"All+or+Nothing-2002-Mike+Leigh-HDTV-720p-17+Subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a918d1bf1cc81671d9df8b3021316d0696dc421c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,24,209,191,28,200,22,113,217,223,139,48,33,49,109,6,150,220,66,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
