Author John Dougill describes each site in detail, stating why they were singled out by Unesco, the current number and types of sites, the application process, how the sites have been selected, and how difficult it is to be given the special status of a World Heritage Site.\n\nDougill traveled to all of the sites in Japan to research this book. Because the Japanese archipelago extends from Siberia all the way down to Taiwan, Dougill describes how his journey led him from the sub-Arctic to the sub-tropical zones. These are without a doubt the most interesting sites that Japan has to offer, including the following:\n\n-  Mount Fuji, Japan's tallest and most sacred volcano. Located on Honshu Island near Tokyo, Mt. Fuji is considered the sacred symbol of Japan\n-  Himeji Castle, a monument from Japan's long feudal history. Also known as Egret Castle, because it looks like a bird taking off in flight.\n-  Horyu-ji Temple, the world's oldest surviving wooden structureÃ¢â‚¬â€a center of Buddhist learning that still serves as a seminary and monastery\n-  Hiroshima Peace Memorial or Atomic-Bomb DomeÃ¢â‚¬â€one of the few structures to partially survive the atomic blast in 1945\n-  The Ogasawara Islands, a remote archipelago of over 30 islandsÃ¢â‚¬â€including Iwo JimaÃ¢â‚¬â€that is home to rare wildlife and spectacular scenery\n\nReaders will learn how Japan first became involved with the World Heritage Sites program back in 1993, the importance of these designations, and their popularity in Japan, where they are visited by millions of people annually, both Japanese and foreigners.\n\nAbout the Author\nJohn Dougill grew up in Grimsby, UK, and has spent the rest of his life getting as far away as possible. He currently resides in Kyoto, Japan, where he is professor of British Studies at Ryukoku University. His student days took place at Leeds University and Queen's College, Oxford, in the heady days of the early 1970s when the future beckoned with golden arms. He completed his education at the University of Life when he spent a year travelling round the world: Nepal and Bali were his favourites. As a teacher, he spent three years in the Middle East and seven years in Oxford before moving to Japan in 1986. In addition to the books listed here he has produced twelve Japanese college textbooks and 'Gentleman and Hooligan: The British on Film 1921-1971' by Ryukoku Univ. Press. He completed a PhD in English Literature in 1993, and is now consumed in the fascinations of Japanese spirituality. Amongst his hobbies are chess, haiku and visiting Shinto shrines. He has a particular interest in the spirit of place.\n\nCONTENTS\nThe Significance of JapanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s World Heritage Sites 8\n1 MOUNT Fuji 14\n2 ITSUKUSHIMA SHRINE 20\n3 THE peace MEMORIAL at HIROSHIMA 26\n4 HIMEJI CASTLE 28\n5 SHIRAKAWA-GO AND GOKAYAMA 32\n6 world HERITAGE SITES of Ancient KYOTO 38\n7 world HERITAGE SITES of Ancient NARA 90\n8 HORYU-JI 112\n9 world HERITAGE SITES of the KII peninsula 116\n10 world HERITAGE SITES of HIRAIZUMI 130\n11 world HERITAGE SITES of NIKKO 138\n12 IWAMI SILVER MINE 150\n13 world HERITAGE SITES of Okinawa 154\n14 The OGASAwa RA ISLANDS 166\n15 YAKUSHIMA ISLAND 172\n16 SHIRAKAMI SANCHI 178\n17 shiretoko peninsula 182\nAppendix: Additional Sites in Japan\nNominated for World Heritage Status 186\nAcknowledgments / Photo Credits 190\nIndex 191","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4a9e5882631d1bc40bb396252218ad1473b6dfc6","amp;dn":"Japan%27s+World+Heritage+Sites+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4a9e5882631d1bc40bb396252218ad1473b6dfc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,158,88,130,99,29,27,196,11,179,150,37,34,24,173,20,115,182,223,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
