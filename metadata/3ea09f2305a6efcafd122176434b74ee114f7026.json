Inside Architecture documents this trend and features the work of some of the premier architects in the country, including many of their own homes. The twenty-two projects shown are varied and personal, and represent a multiplicity of approaches, locations, and styles. Yet all these interiors share an intelligence and an integrity that give them great impact.
