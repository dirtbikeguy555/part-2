In this season...\nHeavily damaged, the TARDIS crash lands in a rural area of England. As it begins to replenish its energies, the newly regenerated Doctor settles within his surroundings, and meets a young, feisty Scot, Amy Pond. He's forced to leave briefly, but when he returns, he discovers that an alien is on the loose and Earth is 20 minutes from extinction.\n\nThis is the beginning of the fifth season ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ staring a new doctor: Matt Smith.\nI had to give him a chance, as he wouldn't convince me right away, but after telling myself over and over that his chaotic behavior is a result of his recent transformation into the youngest version of 'the doctor' yet, the series was quite watchable. And Karen Gillan (as Amy Pond) is the sexiest companion the doctor had so far, making up for Matt Smith trying to be a second David Tennant. But throughout the season he more and more finds his own way, which is why I'm even looking forward to season 6 (which is already confirmed to come in 2011), cause I hope the storytelling (what really convinced me to watch the whole season 5) will keep it's level.\nNo Trailer this time.\nShare &amp; Enjoy!\n\nFormat :\tXvid\nFile size:  \t357MiB avg per episode\nDuration : \t45min avg. per episode\nWidth : \t624 pixels\nHeight : \t352 pixels\nAspect ratio : \t16:9\nFrame rate : \t23.976 fps\nAudio: \t\tMP3\nNr. of Files:   13\n\nAll files properly named, keeping the original filenames intact, I don't take credit for what I didn't do!
