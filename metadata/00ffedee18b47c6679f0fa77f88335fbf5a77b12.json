Use sweet words to entice a local beauty into a walk along the Seine, and less-then-philosophical rebuffs for those overly zealous, espresso-fuelled cafe 'poets'. There are enough insults and swear words to offend every person in France without even speaking to them in English, which they really dislike.Nobody speaks in strictly formal address anymore. Not even in France, where the common expressions tossed around in cafes are far from text book French. This all-new, totally-up-to-date book fills in the gap between how people really talk in France and what French language students are taught.\n\nNext time youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re traveling or just chattinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ in French with your friends, drop the textbook formality and bust out with expressions they never teach you in school, including:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Cool slang\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Funny insults\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Explicit sex terms\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Raw swear words\n\nDirty French teaches the casual expressions heard every day on the streets of France:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢What's up?\nCa va?\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢He's totally hot.\nIl est un gravure de mode.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢That brie smells funky.\nCe brie sent putain de drole.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢I'm gonna get ripped!\nJe vais me fracasser!\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢I gotta piss.\nJe dois pisser.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢The ref is fucking asshole.\nL'arbitre est un gros enaele!\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Wanna try doggy-style?\nVeux-tu faire l'amour en levrette?\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hotimg.com/direct/VqGrGwm.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hotimg.com/direct/VqGrGwm.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDirty German: Everyday Slang from &quot;What's Up?&quot; to &quot;F*%# Off!&quot;\n\nUlysses Press \nDaniel chaffey\n2009 \nEnglish/German\nISBN  : 1569756732 \nPDF \n178 pages \n1.50 MB\n\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Next time youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re traveling or just chattinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ in German with your friends, drop the textbook formality and bust out with expressions they never teach you in school, including: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Cool slang\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Funny insults\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Explicit sex terms\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Raw swear words Dirty German teaches the casual expressions heard every day on the streets of Germany: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢What's up?\n Wie geht's?
