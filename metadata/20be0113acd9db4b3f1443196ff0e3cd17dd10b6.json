For instance, one immediately notes the unique camera angles (at first it &quot;followed&quot; the main actor from behind, so you only saw his back... yet I was amazed at how much emotion and character was conveyed by his body language)... as the film progressed, I noted how few lines of dialog there were - and how utterly real the acting was. The hand-held camera led to a feeling of voyeurism, like we were actually there watching the watcher... the tension in the movie was palatable and kept me holding my breath... I was slightly disappointed in the very abrupt ending (it was so sudden I actually thought my DVD skipped a chapter)...\n\nIn watching the directors &amp; actor&amp;#039;s commentary I learned that the film was written FOR this particular actor (what an honor!) because he had had worked with the directors before.... the actor said he believed the body is the actor&amp;#039;s instrument and his dream was to someday do a stage show where his back was to the audience the entire time! They also discussed their unique rehearsal process and such - really interesting to hear.... and after seeing this movie, I have now developed my own philosophy of acting: A beginning actor is at Stage 1 where you worry about remembering your lines.... A better actor is in stage 2 and they focus on delivery and HOW their lines are said and the emotions that go with it.... but the best actor is at stage 3 where the real acting is done BETWEEN the spoken lines and without any dialog at all.... that&amp;#039;s what I felt this movie really reinforced - the tremendous acting ability done by a glance and body language.... it is in French with subtitles, but it really was a &quot;thinker&quot; of a movie... not something I would recommend to everyone, but a &quot;must see&quot; for any actor.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20be0113acd9db4b3f1443196ff0e3cd17dd10b6","amp;dn":"Le+Fils+%282002%29+-+Dardenne","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20be0113acd9db4b3f1443196ff0e3cd17dd10b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,190,1,19,172,217,219,75,63,20,67,25,111,240,227,205,23,221,16,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
