Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004: A Century of Flight commemorates this double anniversary by offering more planes, better graphics, and more options than ever before right out of the box, but the game will likely reach its full potential only if it receives great support from its player community.\n\nFans of the previous games in the series will be up and running in no time thanks to the new game's familiar interface, but Flight Simulator 2004 also happens to be the most beginner-friendly game in the series. It's easier to access game options, and each option is actually explained by the game. There's also an excellent interactive flight school hosted by aviation veteran Rod Machado that serves as a surprisingly deep training tool.\n\nThere is enough written material included about the planes, the history of flight, and flying tips to fill an encyclopedia. As such, Flight Simulator 2004 represents one of the rare instances in which online documentation is wholly superior to a printed manual. The documentation includes articles that are supplemented with Web-page-style hyperlinks, which lead to more detailed information about a particular topic. Some even whisk you directly into the cockpit so you can actually re-create the particular flight (or series of flights) discussed in the article. While the fascinating historical articles by Flying magazine's Lane Wallace were commissioned by Microsoft, many of the other articles included are reprints from magazines like AOPA Pilot, and it is amazing to see how the real-world tips provided in these stories can be directly applied in the simulator.\n\nMinimum system requirements :- \n\nThe minimum system requirements for Flight Simulator 2004 - A A Century of Flight are:\nOne of the following operating systems:\n\nMicrosoft Windows 98\nMicrosoft Windows 98 Second Edition\nMicrosoft Windows Millennium Edition\nMicrosoft Windows 2000\nMicrosoft Windows XP\nWindows Vista\n\nProcessor Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 450-megahertz (MHz) processor\n\nMemory\n128 megabytes (MB) of RAM for Windows 2000 and for Windows XP.\n64 MB of RAM for Windows 98 and for Windows Millennium Edition.\n\nHard Disk Space Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1.8 gigabytes (GB) of hard disk space.\nVideo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ An 8 MB, 3-D video card.\nAudio Ã¢â‚¬â€œ An audio card with speakers or with headphones.\nModem Ã¢â‚¬â€œ A modem that supports 56 kilobits per second (Kbps) or a modem that supports an Internet connection for multiplayer games.\nJoystick - A joystick is optional.\nNote These are the minimum system requirements that a computer must have to run Flight Simulator 2004.
