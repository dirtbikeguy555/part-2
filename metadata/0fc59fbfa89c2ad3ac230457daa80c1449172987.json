Hodge [epub]\r\n\r\nThe Knights Templar are one of the most secretive and powerful religious orders in history: for over two centuries they were the elite fighting force of the Crusades. Highly trained, and adhering to a strict chivalric code, their success on the battlefield brought them both wealth and political influence. But it is the legends and secrecy surrounding the order and its Grand Masters that continue to fascinate historians and general readers alike.\r\n\r\nSecrets of the Knights Templar examines each of these mysteries in turn to reveal the truth about the Knights' secret practices, rituals and codes, as well as the continued influence of the Templars today. From the true location of the Holy Grail to the Templars' involvement in the Battle of Bannockburn, and from the sudden downfall of the order to modern-day claims of descent - S. J. Hodge uncovers the hidden links behind the stories and separates historical fact from fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fc59fbfa89c2ad3ac230457daa80c1449172987","amp;dn":"Secrets+of+the+Knights+Templar%3A+The+Hidden+History","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fc59fbfa89c2ad3ac230457daa80c1449172987","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,197,159,191,168,156,42,211,172,35,4,87,218,168,12,20,73,23,41,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
