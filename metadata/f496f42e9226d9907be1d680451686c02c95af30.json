At the time, Valens had only recently established himself as one of the most promising young talents in rock &amp; roll, just barely missing the top of the charts with &quot;Donna,&quot; a number two hit, and pioneering a blend of rock and Latin music with the single's almost equally popular flip side, &quot;La Bamba.&quot; Like many rock stars who died prematurely, it's difficult to assess his unrealized potential; he was only 17 at the time of his death, and had just barely begun to make records. Nevertheless, Valens' music has endured for decades.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Come On Let's Go\n02.La Bamba\n03.That's My Little Suzie\n04.Boney Maronie\n05.Ooh!
