The film is so meticulous in its construction and its feeling of community (its preparation, filming and post-production took several years) that at the same time its length automatically gives it an epic quality it is a remarkably intimate film that is about as far from an epic in the traditional (Hollywood) sense as possible. There are over a hundred speaking parts in the film and it is necessary to stay focused in order to keep track of what&amp;#039;s going on and to whom, which is a good trick to make sure your audience is always paying attention. This is the type of film that is not simply watched but EXPERIENCED - the director demands nothing less from his audience. &quot;A Brighter Summer Day&quot; is a very personal vision that recalls both Yang&amp;#039;s own childhood and an actual street murder that shook the nation. The film itself slowly and almost hypnotically builds towards this singular act of violence and at the end when it finally arrives it is both shocking and inevitable. &quot;A Brighter Summer Day&quot; keeps with the trend among the finest films to emerge from Taiwan in that it is very pared down - the cast are all nonactors and there is no non-diagetic music. It is beautifully shot, moving from the interiors of houses, schools, and cheap dance clubs to the open fields of the countryside in summertime. Alternating between violence and serenity, the film is a rhythmic and poetic evocation of a particular era. Its ironic title (in that there is no &quot;brighter summer day&quot; for these characters) is taken from an Elvis song that one of the kids sings at a nightclub. It is a truly exemplary modern masterpiece that got no distribution in the West but deserves to be hunted out at all costs by those who love and cherish the film art. - liehtzu, IMdB\n\nJonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader named this one of his &quot;favorite films of the 1990s&quot;;
