The band's founding members are guitarist/singer Kevin Shields and drummer Colm ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“ CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­osÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ig. The lineup during the band's late 80s/early 90s heyday included singer-guitarist Bilinda Butcher and bassist Debbie Googe after the band settled in London. As My Bloody Valentine's music progressed, their use of distortion, pitch bending, and digital reverb resulted in a sound that came to be known as shoegazing. The group's 1991 critically acclaimed album Loveless took two years to make mostly due to funding problems. Following Loveless, My Bloody Valentine became inactive, with Shields recording and shelving several albums' worth of follow-up material. In 2007, Shields announced that the band had reunited and were recording new material. The name of the band is derived from the 1981 horror film of the same name\n\n.: My Bloody Valentine Group :.\n\n[img]http://www.ondarock.it/photo/Mybloody.jpg[/img]\n\n.: Albums :.\n\nIsn't Anything (1988)\nLoveless (1991)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9214ba4ec71bbf50b6dcc4e1625d56ff79be0d80","amp;dn":"My+Bloody+Valentine+-+Discography+1988-1991+%5BMp3+VBR%5D+TNT+Villag","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9214ba4ec71bbf50b6dcc4e1625d56ff79be0d80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,20,186,78,199,27,191,80,182,220,196,225,98,93,86,255,121,190,13,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
