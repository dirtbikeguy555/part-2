There&amp;#039;s also a voodoo priestess, a world-famous bulldog, an eccentric inventor who just might possess a substance that could poison the population of a mid-sized city, a colorful old school lawyer, a flamboyant drag queen, a visiting investigative reporter who knows a good story when he sees one, and added into the mix is the sun-bathed culture and vitality of Savannah itself.\n\n  Starring: Kevin Spacey, John Cusack, Jack Thompson, Allison Eastwood, Irma P.
