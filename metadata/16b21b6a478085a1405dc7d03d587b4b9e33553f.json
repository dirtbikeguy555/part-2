The album released on June 3, 1997 features songs originally released on both the Epic and MCA labels, as well as three previously unreleased recordings (&quot;Tell Me&quot;, &quot;Higher Power&quot; and &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;). Tom Scholz, the band's leader, felt that the album's sound quality was not up to his standards, so a remastered version of the album was released in 2008 with a slightly different track listing. Boston embarked on a tour for this album both times it was released.\n\nThe album was certified double platinum by the RIAA on December 4, 2003, and it has sold 2,234,000 copies in the United States as of August 2014\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written and composed by Tom Scholz, except where noted. \n\n1997 Original \t\n\nNo. \tTitle \tFrom album \tLength \t\n\n1. \t&quot;Tell Me&quot;   \tPreviously Unissued, 1997 \t4:04\n2. \t&quot;Higher Power&quot; (Scholz, David Sikes) \tPreviously Unissued \t5:06\n3. \t&quot;More Than a Feeling&quot;   \tBoston, 1976 \t4:45\n4. \t&quot;Peace of Mind&quot;   \tBoston, 1976 \t5:05\n5. \t&quot;Don't Look Back&quot;   \tDon't Look Back, 1978 \t5:57\n6. \t&quot;Cool the Engines&quot; (Brad Delp, Fran Sheehan, Scholz) \tThird Stage, 1986 \t4:35\n7. \t&quot;Livin' for You&quot;   \tWalk On, 1994 \t4:55\n8. \t&quot;Feelin' Satisfied&quot;   \tDon't Look Back, 1978 \t4:11\n9. \t&quot;Party&quot; (Scholz, Delp) \tDon't Look Back, 1978 \t4:08\n10. \t&quot;Foreplay/Long Time&quot;   \tBoston, 1976 \t7:48\n11. \t&quot;Amanda&quot;   \tThird Stage, 1986 \t4:15\n12. \t&quot;Rock and Roll Band&quot;   \tBoston, 1976 \t3:00\n13. \t&quot;Smokin'&quot; (Scholz, Delp) \tBoston, 1976 \t4:20\n14. \t&quot;A Man I'll Never Be&quot;   \tDon't Look Back, 1978 \t6:32\n15. \t&quot;The Star-Spangled Banner/4th of July Reprise&quot; (John Stafford Smith, Tom Scholz [Note 1]) \tPreviously Unissued \t2:44\n16. \t&quot;Higher Power [Kalodner edit]&quot; (Scholz, Sikes) \tPreviously Unissued \t3:52\n\nPersonnel\n\n    Tom Scholz Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar, bass, organ, drums, clavinet, keyboards, hand clapping\n    Brad Delp Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals, guitar, hand clapping\n    Barry Goudreau Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar\n    Fran Sheehan Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar\n    Sib Hashian Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n    Jim Masdea Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n    Gary Pihl Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitar\n    Fran Cosmo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ vocals\n    David Sikes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar, vocals\n    Doug Huffman Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n\nNow, if you like the music go to the shows and buy the merch,Want the CD buy it from the bands webpage (NOT wal-mart) that money goes to the artists not to anyone else","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16b21b6a478085a1405dc7d03d587b4b9e33553f","amp;dn":"Boston++The+Best+Of....+1997+++320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16b21b6a478085a1405dc7d03d587b4b9e33553f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,178,27,106,71,128,133,161,64,93,199,208,61,88,123,75,158,51,85,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
