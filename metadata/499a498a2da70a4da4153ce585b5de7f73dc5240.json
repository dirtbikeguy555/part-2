Their popularity peaked in the mid to late 1980s with albums Mars Needs Guitars!, Blow Your Cool! and Magnum Cum Louder.\nHoodoo Gurus had a string of acclaimed pop-rock singles including &quot;Leilani&quot; (1982), &quot;Tojo&quot; (1983), &quot;My Girl&quot; (1983), &quot;I Want You Back&quot; (1984), &quot;Bittersweet&quot;, &quot;Like Wow - Wipeout!&quot;, and &quot;What's My Scene?&quot;. After touring the United States from 1984 onwards they gained popularity on the U.S. college rock circuit with singles &quot;Come Anytime&quot; (1989) reaching #1 and &quot;Miss Freelove '69&quot; (1991) reaching #3 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. GurusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ biggest Australian hit single was their 1987 Top 3 hit song &quot;What's My Scene?&quot; or, as modified for the National Rugby League 2000s theme, &quot;That's My Team&quot;.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n             Hoodoo Gurus - Gold Watch 20 Golden Greats\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Hoodoo Gurus\nAlbum................: Gold Watch 20 Golden Greats\nGenre................: Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2012\nRipper...............: EAC \nCodec................: LAME 3.98\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: MP3 VBRV0\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\nTags.................: ID3 v2.3\nInformation..........:\nInformation..........:\nRipped by............: pLAN9\nPosted by............: Bubanee\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
