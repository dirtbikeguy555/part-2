This experimental project proved quite popular, not only with German-speaking readers. Many of his chess colleagues liked this form of individual training; and some of them used the material in their classes too. This favourable reaction prompted the idea of an English translation.\nAlthough the booklets were aimed at players of differing abilities, most wanted the complete set. And that's how these different themes have ended up in one book. You could also look on this diversity as a strength if a reader, with chess ambitions, wants to test his overall ability. Moreover, for chess trainers this book provides several ready-made lectures, and many useful exercises covering different aspects of the game, already sorted in terms of their level of difficulty.\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s23.postimg.org/kctvp1rjv/Yusupov.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s23.postimg.org/kctvp1rjv/Yusupov.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nArtur Yusupov was born in Moscow on 13th February i960 and learned to play chess at the age of six.

Other significant successes include 1st place in Hamburg 1991, 1st~3rd place in Amsterdam 1994, and 2nd place in Horgen 1994 (Category 18) behind Kasparov. Artur Yusupov has also made a name for himself as a trainer, notably for Viswana-than Anand in his world championship matches against Kasparov in 1995, and against , Karpov in 1998. The quality of his training is reflected in the success of his chess academy in Weissenhorn, Germany.\nArtur Yusupov is also well-known as an author, having written several opening books and, most notably, as co-author (with Mark Dvoretsky) of five highly successful instructional works.\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface -VII\n1 Back-Rank Combinations - 1\n2 Candidate Moves - 15\n3 The Wrong-Coloured Bishop -35\n4 Exchanging Pieces -57\n5 Passed Pawns in the Middlegame -75\n6 Double Attack -95\n7 The Process of Elimination -115\n8 Zugzwang - 135\n9 Im proving Piece Position -153\n10 Trapping a Piece -171\nAppendix -187\nIndex of composers and analysts- 187\nIndex of games- 189\nExplanation of symbols - 196\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s7.postimg.org/4ccgdhzkb/Chess_Lessons_by_Artur_Yusupov.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s7.postimg.org/4ccgdhzkb/Chess_Lessons_by_Artur_Yusupov.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96d21ceb0c02365c7a20f502fa0f57bc92727cb4","amp;dn":"Chess+Lessons+by+Artur+Yusupov+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96d21ceb0c02365c7a20f502fa0f57bc92727cb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,210,28,235,12,2,54,92,122,32,245,2,250,15,87,188,146,114,124,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
