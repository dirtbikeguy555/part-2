Cognitive Neuroscience of Human Systems: Work and Everyday Life addresses the relationship between neurophysiological processes and the performance and experience of humans in everyday life. It samples the vast neuroscience literature to identify those areas of research that speak directly to the performance and experience of humans in everyday settings, highlighting the practical, everyday application of brain science.\n\nThe book explains the underlying basis for well-established principles from human factors, ergonomics, and industrial engineering and design. It also sheds new light on factors affecting human performance and behavior. This is not an academic treatment of neuroscience, but rather a translation that makes modern brain science accessible and easily applicable to systems design, education and training, and the development of policies and practices. The authors supply clear and direct guidance on the applications of principles from brain science to everyday problems.\n\nWith discussions of topics from brain science and their relevance to everyday activities, the book focuses on the science, describing the findings and the studies producing these findings. It then decodes how these findings relate to everyday life and how you can integrate them into your work to achieve more effective outcomes based on a fundamental understanding of how the operations of the human brain produce behavior and modulate performance.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nSeries: Human Factors and Ergonomics\nPDF: 322 pages\nPublisher: CRC Press; 1 edition (September 26, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1466570571\nISBN-13: 978-1466570573\nAmazon Link:\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f1c55cdf35bee348b66f180b7e161fdbe0b2a65","amp;dn":"Cognitive+Neuroscience+of+Human+Systems%3A+Work+and+Everyday+Life+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f1c55cdf35bee348b66f180b7e161fdbe0b2a65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,28,85,205,243,91,238,52,139,102,241,128,183,225,97,253,190,11,42,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
