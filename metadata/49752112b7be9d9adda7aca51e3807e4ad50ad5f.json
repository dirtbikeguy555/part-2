In recent years scientists have discovered that 95 percent of the contents of the cosmos are invisible to all of our current methods of direct detection. Yet they are definitely there: Something is holding galaxies and galaxy clusters together, and something else is causing space itself to fly apart.\n\nScientists call these invisible components dark matter and dark energyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½&quot;dark&quot; because these phenomena don&amp;#039;t emit light, not because we aren&amp;#039;t learning more and more about them. Indeed, dark matter and dark energy are the most eagerly studied subjects in astronomy and particle physics today. And for good reasonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½what could be more exciting than cracking the mystery of the fundamental constituents and overall composition of the universe?\n\n\nCourse Lecture Titles:\n\n1.
