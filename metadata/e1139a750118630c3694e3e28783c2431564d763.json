From quick pencil sketches to fully finished color studies, the author uses &quot;drawing classes&quot; throughout the book to skillfully demonstrate each technique. Alongside drawings by famous Masters, the book uses the artist''s drawing book as the center of its investigation, examining attitudes and demonstrating techniques that will excite the imagination and enhance the skills of the reader.\n\nAbout the Author\nSarah Simblet teaches at the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art, University of Oxford, and at the Royal College of Art in London. She has studied and worked in Oxford, Cheltenham, Heidelberg, and Madrid, and was awarded her PhD by the University of Bristol.
