Rage formed in Los Angeles in the early '90s out of the wreckage of a number of local groups: vocalist Zack de la Rocha (the son of Chicano political artist Beto) emerged from the bands Headstance, Farside, and Inside Out; guitarist Tom Morello (the nephew of Jomo Kenyatta, the first Kenyan president) originated in Lock Up; and drummer Brad Wilk played with future Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder. Rounded out by bassist Tim Bob (aka Tim C., born Tim Commerford), a childhood friend of de la Rocha's, Rage debuted in 1992 with a self-released, self-titled 12-song cassette featuring the song &quot;Bullet in the Head,&quot; which became a hit when reissued as a single later in the year.\n\nThe tape won the band a deal with Epic, and their leap to the majors did not go unnoticed by detractors, who questioned the revolutionary integrity of Rage Against the Machine's decision to align itself with the label's parent company, media behemoth Sony. Undeterred, the quartet emerged in late 1992 with their eponymous official debut, which scored the hits &quot;Killing in the Name&quot; and &quot;Bombtrack.&quot; After touring with Lollapalooza and declaring their support of groups like FAIR (Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting), Rock for Choice, and Refuse &amp; Resist, Rage spent a reportedly tumultuous four years working on their follow-up; despite rumors of a breakup, they returned in 1996 with Evil Empire, which entered the U.S. album charts at number one and scored a hit single with &quot;Bulls on Parade.&quot; During 1997, the group joined forces with hip-hop supergroup the Wu-Tang Clan for a summer tour and remained active in support of various leftist political causes, including a controversial 1999 benefit concert for death-row inmate Mumia Abu-Jamal. The Battle of Los Angeles followed later in 1999, also debuting at number one and going double platinum by the following summer. In early 2000, de la Rocha announced plans for a solo project, and the band performed an incendiary show outside the Democratic National Convention in August. The following month, bassist Commerford was arrested for disorderly conduct at MTV's Video Music Awards following his bizarre disruption of a Limp Bizkit acceptance speech, in which he climbed to the top of a 15-foot set piece and rocked back and forth.\n\nPlans for a live album were announced shortly thereafter, but in October, de la Rocha abruptly announced his departure from the band, citing breakdowns in communication and group decision-making. Surprised but not angry, the remainder of Rage announced plans to continue with a new vocalist, while de la Rocha re-focused on his solo album, which was slated to include collaborations with acclaimed hip-hop artists including DJ Shadow and El-P of Company Flow. December 2000 saw the release of de la Rocha's final studio effort with the band, the Rick Rubin-produced Renegades; it featured nearly a dozen covers of hip-hop, rock, and punk artists like EPMD, Bruce Springsteen, Devo, the Rolling Stones, the MC5, and more. By 2001, Morello, Wilk, and Commerford had formed Audioslave with former Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell, and the group released an eponymous album by the end of 2002. With a de la Rocha solo album still not announced, Epic finally released the long-promised concert album Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium on CD and DVD in time for Christmas 2003.\n\n\n\n\n\nRage Against The Machine - Selftitled Debut [Original 1st press LP] 24-bit/96kHz \n\nUltimately, if there's any disappointment to be had with this near-perfect album, it's that it still towers above subsequent efforts as the unequivocal climax of Rage Against the Machine's vision. As such, it remains absolutely essential.\n\nIn 2001 Q magazine named Rage Against the Machine as one of the 50 Heaviest Albums Of All Time. The album is included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. In 2003, the album was ranked number 368 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written and arranged by Rage Against the Machine and all lyrics by Zack de la Rocha.\n\nSide A\n\n      &quot;Bombtrack&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05\n      &quot;Killing in the Name&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:14\n      &quot;Take the Power Back&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:37\n      &quot;Settle for Nothing&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:48\n      &quot;Bullet in the Head&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:09\n\n\nSide B\n\n      &quot;Know Your Enemy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:55\n      &quot;Wake Up&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:04\n      &quot;Fistful of Steel&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:31\n      &quot;Township Rebellion&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:24\n      &quot;Freedom&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:06\n\n\n\n\n\nRage Against The Machine - Evil Empire [Music On Vinyl 180g LP] 24-bit/96kHz\n\nEvil Empire is the second album by American rap metal band Rage Against the Machine. It was released on April 16, 1996, almost four years after the band's first, self-titled album.\n\nThe album's title is taken from the phrase &quot;evil empire,&quot; which was used by former U.S. President Ronald Reagan and many conservatives in describing the former Soviet Union.\n\nThe track &quot;Bulls on Parade&quot; became the first single and, as with their debut, five singles were released in total.\n\nEvil Empire debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200. The song &quot;Tire Me&quot; won the 1996 Grammy award for Best Metal Performance. The tracks &quot;Bulls on Parade&quot; and &quot;People of the Sun&quot; were both nominated for Grammy's for Best Hard Rock Performance in separate years.\n\nOn May 24, 2000 the album went Triple Platinum.\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs written and arranged by Rage Against the Machine and all lyrics by Zack de la Rocha.\n\nSide A\n\n      &quot;People of the Sun&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:30\n      &quot;Bulls on Parade&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:51\n      &quot;Vietnow&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:39\n      &quot;Revolver&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:30\n      &quot;Snakecharmer&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n\n\nSide B\n\n      &quot;Tire Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:00\n      &quot;Down Rodeo&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:20\n      &quot;Without a Face&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:36\n      &quot;Wind Below&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:50\n      &quot;Roll Right&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:22\n      &quot;Year of tha Boomerang&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59\n\n\n\n\n\nRage Against The Machine - The Battle of Los Angeles [Music On Vinyl 180g LP] 24-bit/96kHz\n\nThe Battle of Los Angeles is the third studio album by Rage Against the Machine. It was released on November 2, 1999, and over three years after their second studio album, Evil Empire. Between Evil Empire and Los Angeles, the band released a live album, titled Live &amp; Rare.\n \nThe song &quot;Calm Like a Bomb&quot; is featured in the credits of The Matrix Reloaded. The videos to &quot;Sleep Now in the Fire&quot; and &quot;Testify&quot; were directed by documentarian Michael Moore. Both &quot;Testify&quot; and &quot;Guerrilla Radio&quot; are also featured in the video game Rock Band 2, being on-disc and downloadable, respectively.\n \nThe album debuted at #1 on Billboard's Top 200 selling 420,000 copies its first week. That week saw a busy CD release schedule. The album denied Mariah Carey's highly anticipated album the chance to open at #1. &quot;Guerrilla Radio&quot; was featured in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, albeit heavily edited on the Nintendo 64 version, and it is also heavily edited on &quot;Madden NFL 10&quot;. Both Time and Rolling Stone named it the Best Album of 1999. It was listed as #53 in SPIN Magazine's 100 Greatest Albums, 1985-2005.\n \nThe album cover art was an original artwork by the LA Street Phantom aka Joey Krebs aka Joel Jaramillo, a well-known Los Angeles artist who has exhibited at numerous galleries in Los Angeles, New York City and throughout the United States. Despite claims to the contrary, the image was not inspired by images from the 1992 street riots of LA or from images of Munich, but by the band's own music and words, and represents one in a series of images of the artist's work, which can also be seen on various street murals in Los Angeles.\n \nThe Battle of Los Angeles was heavily influenced by the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell. &quot;Testify&quot;, &quot;Sleep Now in the Fire&quot;, &quot;Voice of the Voiceless&quot;, among other songs, include direct quotes from the novel, and mention key Orwellian terms in the lyrics.\n \nSaul Williams sampled &quot;Born of a Broken Man&quot; for his song &quot;Om Nia Merican&quot;, which appeared on his 2001 album Amethyst Rock Star.\n \nIn 2003, the album was ranked number 426 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs written and arranged by Rage Against the Machine and all lyrics by Zack de la Rocha.\n \nSide A\n&quot;Testify&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:30\n&quot;Guerrilla Radio&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:26\n&quot;Calm Like a Bomb&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:58\n&quot;Mic Check&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:33\n&quot;Sleep Now in the Fire&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n&quot;Born of a Broken Man&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:41\n \nSide B\n&quot;Born as Ghosts&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:21\n&quot;Maria&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:48\n&quot;Voice of the Voiceless&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:31\n&quot;New Millennium Homes&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44\n&quot;Ashes in the Fall&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:36\n&quot;War Within a Breath&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:36\n\n\n\n\n\nRage Against The Machine - Renegades [Music on Vinyl 180g LP] 24-bit/96kHz\n\nRenegades is the first cover album and the last studio album by American band Rage Against the Machine. The album consists entirely of cover songs and includes covers of artists such as Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Minor Threat, Eric B. &amp; Rakim, EPMD, MC5, The Rolling Stones, Cypress Hill, and Devo. It was released in 2000, after Rage singer Zack de la Rocha had already left the band, but featured his vocals. After the release of Renegades, the remaining three members of the band reformed with Chris Cornell on vocals as Audioslave. Rage did, however, release another album, Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium, a live recording of their final two concerts before their initial break-up, in Los Angeles on September 12 and September 13, 2000. The bonus live version of &quot;Kick Out the Jams&quot; on the European version of this album also appears on Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium.\n\nThe album achieved platinum status a little over a month after its initial release.\n\nTrack listing\n\nSide A\n\n1. &quot;Microphone Fiend&quot; 5:01\n\n      Writer: Eric Barrier, Rakim Allah\n      Original Artist: Eric B &amp; Rakim (1988)\n\n\n2. &quot;Pistol Grip Pump&quot; 3:18\n\n      Writer: Volume 10\n      Original Artist: Volume 10 (1994)\n\n\n3. &quot;Kick Out the Jams&quot; 3:11\n\n      Writer: Wayne Kramer, Fred &quot;Sonic&quot; Smith, Rob Tyner, Michael Davis, Dennis Thompson\n      Original Artist: MC5 (1969)\n\n\n4. &quot;Renegades of Funk&quot; 4:35\n\n      Writer: Afrika Bambaataa, Arthur Baker, John Miller, John Robie\n      Original Artist: Afrika Bambaataa (1983)\n\n\n5. &quot;Beautiful World&quot; 2:35\n\n      Writer: Mark Mothersbaugh, Gerald Casale\n      Original Artist: Devo (1981)\n\n\n6. &quot;I'm Housin'&quot; 4:56\n\n      Writer: Erick Sermon, Parish Smith\n      Original Artist:EPMD (1988)\n\n\nSide B\n\n7. &quot;In My Eyes&quot; 2:54\n\n      Writer: Ian MacKaye, Jeff Nelson, Brian Baker, Lyle Preslar, Steve Hansgen\n      Original Artist: Minor Threat (1981)\n\n\n8. &quot;How I Could Just Kill a Man&quot; 4:04\n\n      Writer: Louis Freese, Senen Reyes, Lawrence Muggerud\n      Original Artist: Cypress Hill (1991)\n\n\n9. &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad&quot; 5:38\n\n      Writer &amp; Original Artist:Bruce Springsteen (1995)\n\n\n10. &quot;Down on the Street&quot; ) 3:38\n\n      Writer: Iggy Pop, Ron Asheton, Scott Asheton, Dave Alexander\n      Original Artist: The Stooges (1970\n\n\n11. &quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; 4:42\n\n      Writer: Mick Jagger, Keith Richards\n      Original Artist: The Rolling Stones (1968)\n\n\n12. &quot;Maggie's Farm&quot; 6:54\n\n      Writer &amp; Original Artist: Bob Dylan (1965)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:327b76a738a4cf9e4f15c6d2a34031afd66db8b9","amp;dn":"Rage+Against+The+Machine+-+Discography+%5BVinyl%5D+%5BFLAC%5D-aksman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"327b76a738a4cf9e4f15c6d2a34031afd66db8b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,123,118,167,56,164,207,158,79,21,198,210,163,64,49,175,214,109,184,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
