In this course, professor Isac Artzi dissects the anatomy of C, from data types, strings, and variables to simple functions. He'll show how these basic elements fit together in control structures like loops and if-else statementsÃ¢â‚¬â€where the real logic behind your code comes into play. Plus, learn how C organizes information into arrays and how you can manage memory resources with pointers.\n\nC is a great first step for new programmers, and a way to broaden and deepen your knowledge if you've already programmed for a while. Press Play to start learning.\nTopics include:\n\nReviewing the C language and the C11 standard\nUnderstanding the development cycle\nSetting values\nWriting statements and expressions\nAdding comments to code for clarity\nDeclaring data types\nManipulating strings\nDeclaring variables\nUsing operators and expressions\nWorking with functions\nControlling flow with if-else statements and loops\nInitializing arrays\nWorking with files\nIncluding files and executing macros with the C preprocessor\nUnderstanding best coding practices\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bda9d565168f1b5831d71cb6228d2f8d36172f0","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+C+Essential+Training","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bda9d565168f1b5831d71cb6228d2f8d36172f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,218,157,86,81,104,241,181,131,29,113,203,98,40,210,248,211,97,114,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
