In short order, Obey The Brave took their message to the people, armed with the gritty crunch of classic acts like Hatebreed and Madball and the melodic heft and energized spirit of Epitaph label mates past and present like Pennywise and NOFX. The shadow of Pantera looms large over heavy music and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a hint of that timeless sound in there, too.\n\nAggressive might, old-school attitude and pit-demolishing anthems propel Salvation, the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second album, which brims with the chemistry and unified vision Obey The Brave crafted touring the world with bands like Chelsea Grin, Emmure, We Came As Romans, Blessthefall, Counterparts, Stick To Your Guns, Stray From The Path and more.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“As soon as we announced the formation of the band, we had management, a label and we were already on tour,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ vocalist Alex Erian enthusiastically recalls. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Miguel and I live in Montreal, the rest of the band live about two hours away in Ottawa. We were friends, but we all know each other much better and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve toured about 26 countries together. These guys arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just friends now Ã¢â‚¬â€œ they are roommates, best friends, brothers.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nObey The Brave smash the Ã¢â‚¬Å“sophomore slumpÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ stigma by nature of the way things came together. They had only been together for a few short months when they crafted their debut, Young Blood, which captured the fire and excitement of new possibilities, collective focus and passionate power. Salvation is the fully realized sound of a band whose identity has been cemented on the road, operating with renewed vigor and fire.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Salvation represents us more accurately, as people, lyrically and musically,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ declares the former Despised Icon frontman. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got a bit more punk rock influence, a bit more hardcore. Deep down, we still have metal elements. We consider ourselves a metalcore band. We grew up in the hardcore scene, in the punk rock scene, and enjoy it all.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nErianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s former group, Despised Icon, was a Ã¢â‚¬Å“bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ who counted genre-standard bearers in likeminded groups among their fans. The band dissolved right around the time former Canadian metal merchants Blind Witness and Dark Rites were calling it quits. Erian with Blind WitnessÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ John Campbell (guitar) and Miguel Lepage (bass) plus Greg Wood (guitar) and Stevie Morotti (drums) of Darkness Rites made for a Ã¢â‚¬Å“supergroupÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of sorts. Obey The Brave had thousands of fans on Facebook before they had released a single note of music. The music video for their first single now has over 1 million views.\n\n01. Short Fuse\n02.
