The group first formed in Sacramento, CA during 1988, when then high-school students Stephen Carpenter (guitar), Abe Cunningham (drums), and Chino Moreno (vocals) first began to jam together. They chose the name Deftones and began playing out locally shortly thereafter, going through several different bass players before finding a permanent bassist in the form of Chi Cheng.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Rocket Skates\n02.Hole In The Earth\n03.Change (In The House Of Flies)\n04.Minerva\n05.Diamond Eyes\n06.Digital Bath\n07.If Only Tonight We Could Sleep\n08.My Own Summer (Shove It)\n09.Back To School (Mini Maggit)\n10.No Ordinary Love\n11.Mein\n12.Royal\n13.Feiticeira\n14.Savory\n15.Hexagram\n16.7 Words\n17.Be Quiet And Drive (Far Away)\n18.Bored\n19.Teenager\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Elite\n02.CmndCtrl\n03.Beware\n04.The Boy's Republic\n05.Bloody Cape\n06.Sextape\n07.Cherry Waves\n08.Rx Queen\n09.Risk\n10.Crenshaw Punch/I'll Throw Rocks At You\n11.Street Carp\n12.Beauty School\n13.Around The Fur\n14.Root\n15.Kimdracula\n16.Headup\n17.Engine No. 9\n18.Wax And Wane\n19.Passenger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n                 \n                   ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46121e3d550d57ef4f42b3f87381ec751a7c1cd8","amp;dn":"Deftones+-+Greatest+Hits+2CD+%282010%29+%5B320%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46121e3d550d57ef4f42b3f87381ec751a7c1cd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,18,30,61,85,13,87,239,79,66,179,248,115,129,236,117,26,124,28,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
