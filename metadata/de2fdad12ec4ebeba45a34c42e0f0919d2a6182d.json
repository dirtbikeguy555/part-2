The original idea that George Harrison and Guy Laliberte (founder of Cirque du Soleil) to make a soundscape of Beatles music for a CDS show has been wonderfully realized. Songs we all heard for decades and hundreds of times over sound new again -- more so, the 'mash-up' concept literally re-invents the songs -- hearing 'Mr Kite!/She's So Heavy/Helter Skelter' yesterday for the first time was astounding -- the riff of 'Hey Bulldog' that makes a brief appearance in 'Lady Madonna', the string arrangment put to the demo of 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps', the newly remastered and remixed 'I am the Walrus' (finally!) -- it's a new day for Beatles fans. Some might view the Beatles' catalog as a sacred cow that should remain fixed and 'as was, as always should be' as they recorded it, and not be 'mashed-up' (all the superimposing of parts of one track onto another, time-shifting and altering the recordings to match tempos and keys). Understandable, since how indeed can really improve upon what they did way back when? But I very much enjoy 'Love' -- and appreciate that in with today's modern recording (Pro Tools was among the credits), Martin &amp; son were able to present the timeless and beloved Beatles tracks in a new light, while making it clear how incredibly gifted the Beatles were -- you can hear all the instruments, vocals, sound effects better than ever before. While 'Love' might not be the best choice for a casual fan (one who has the red and blue best-ofs and/or '1'), it is an aural bonanza for a serious fan, in particular of the 'Revolver' era onwards with a focus on the psychelic years. To paraphrase the dearly departed George Harrison, I dig 'Love'!!\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nBeatles, The - LOVE\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Beatles, The\nAlbum................: LOVE\nGenre................: Pop/Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2006\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
