In her short musical career, the North London native changed the landscape of modern pop culture, won countless awards, achieved critical acclaim and garnered global success before tragically dying at the tender age of 27. On the eve of the release of Asif Kapadia's Amy documentary film which explores Winehouse's life and death, here is an exploration of her music and her influences in her own words.\nConsisting performances and interviews entirely from the BBC archives this film celebrates Amy's music, her influences, her challenges as an artist and her eternal brutal honesty in her own words. Featuring exclusive unseen and rarely seen songs from her triple platinum selling album Frank and revered Grammy winning album Back To Black, this programme pays homage to the tattooed rebellious rock &amp; roll spirited songstress who wrote smart, sad, soulful and original pop songs that became instant classics and inspired a generation.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8f/Amy-Winehouse-in-her-Own-Words-Screen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8f/Amy-Winehouse-in-her-Own-Words-Screen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c8/Amy-Winehouse-in-her-Own-Words-Screen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c8/Amy-Winehouse-in-her-Own-Words-Screen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ac/Amy-Winehouse-in-her-Own-Words-Screen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ac/Amy-Winehouse-in-her-Own-Words-Screen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/06/Amy-Winehouse-in-her-Own-Words-Screen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/06/Amy-Winehouse-in-her-Own-Words-Screen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ad/Amy-Winehouse-in-her-Own-Words-Screen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ad/Amy-Winehouse-in-her-Own-Words-Screen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;2169484649616d150f10&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 2997 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 24mins\n * Framerate: 25 fps\n * Number of Parts: 1\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: 516 MB\n * Source: WEBRip\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\nRelease Notes\nMerged Subtitles\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information \n * http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02ty1n4\n\n2)  Related Documentaries \n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=The%20Amy%20Winehouse%20Story\n * http://docuwiki.net/?title=Amy%20Winehouse%3A%20The%20Day%20She%20Came%20to%20Dingle","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0fd4283909ef26e22870bee9307963923684fce","amp;dn":"BBC.Amy.Winehouse.In.Her.Own.Words.720p.WEBRip.x264.AAC.MVGroup.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0fd4283909ef26e22870bee9307963923684fce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,253,66,131,144,158,242,110,34,135,11,238,147,7,150,57,35,104,79,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
