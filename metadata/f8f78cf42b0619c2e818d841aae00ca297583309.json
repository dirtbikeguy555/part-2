Go for it! :D\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nMechanical Engineering Principles offers a student-friendly introduction to core engineering topics\n\nThis book introduces mechanical principles and technology through examples and applications rather than theory. John Bird and Carl Ross do not assume any previous background in engineering studies, and as such this book can act as a core textbook for several engineering courses. This approach enables students to develop a sound understanding of engineering principles and their use in practice. These theoretical concepts are supported by 320 fully worked problems, nearly 600 further problems with answers, and 276 multiple-choice questions giving the reader a firm grounding on each topic.\n\nThe new edition is up to date with the latest BTEC National specifications and can also be used on undergraduate courses in mechanical, civil, structural, aeronautical and marine engineering, together with naval architecture. A chapter has been added at the beginning on revisionary mathematics since progress in engineering studies is not possible without some basic mathematics knowledge. Minor modifications and some further worked problems have also been added throughout the text.\n\nColour layout helps navigation and highlights key points\nStudent-friendly approach with numerous worked problems, multiple-choice and short-answer questions, exercises, revision tests and nearly 400 diagrams\nSupported with free online material for students and lecturers\nReaders will also be able to access the free companion website at: www.routledge/cw/bird where they will find videos of practical demonstrations by Carl Ross. Full worked solutions of all 600 of the further problems will be available for lecturers/instructors use, as will the full solutions and marking scheme for the 8 revision tests.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8f78cf42b0619c2e818d841aae00ca297583309","amp;dn":"Mechanical+Engineering+Principles%2C+2E+%5BPDF%5D%7EStormRG%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8f78cf42b0619c2e818d841aae00ca297583309","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,247,140,244,43,6,25,194,232,24,216,65,170,224,12,162,151,88,51,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
