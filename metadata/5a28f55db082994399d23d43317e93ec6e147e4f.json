Inspired by the\nrelentless forward march of post-punk, the young Reynolds was sceptical\nof bands such as Primal Scream or Spacemen 3, who waved their\ninfluences like a flag: &quot;music,&quot; as he once defined it, &quot;where the\nlistener's knowledge of prior rock music is integral to the full\naesthetic appreciation of the record.&quot; It's a nice concept, but one\nthat's in the eye of the beholder. If a band have a broad enough\nspectrum of influences and adapt or combine them in clever, compelling\nways, then an audience not necessarily versed in those influences will\ntake them at face value. In the worst cases, a candidly celebrated\nrecord collection feels like a cage; in the best it's a door.\n\nWhen the Horrors emerged, in a cloud of dry ice, from Southend six\nyears ago, it was difficult to tell which way they were heading.\nLooking like gravediggers and sounding like cratediggers, they were\npassionately devoted to Joe Meek, the Birthday Party, the Cramps and\noutrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© garage rock (they covered the Sonics and Screaming Lord Sutch),\nand they didn't mind who knew it. With costumes, pseudonyms and artwork\nto match the music, their 2007 debut album Strange House felt so\nconceptually neat that it might have been an airlock. Add to that the\nmixed blessing of music-press hype and you had a young band with\neverything to prove.\n\nThat made 2009's Mercury-nominated Primary Colours a dream of a second\nalbum. You could still hazard a strong guess at the records on the\nquintet's shelves (they have a distinct, old-fashioned aroma of vinyl\nrather than downloaded Zip files) but they struck you as less important\nthan the overall mood, which managed to be at once brooding and\neuphoric. A similar confidence radiated from frontman Faris Badwan's\nrecent side-project, Cat's Eyes, a gothic girl-group song cycle that\nsounded both recognisable and uncanny, like a familiar face glimpsed,\nout of context, in a dream.\n\nPrimary Colours' chrysalis-to-butterfly transformation benefited from\nlow expectations, but after a few listens the self-produced Skying\nfeels like an equally impressive advance, one that announces the\nHorrors' arrival as one of the best bands in the country. One marker of\ntheir progress is that a couple of songs (including the single Still\nLife) recall Simple Minds, and not the hip, frozen-veined, post-punk\nSimple Minds of Empires and Dance either. Now, it's just about possible\nthat one member came in one day with a battered 7in of Don't You\n(Forget About Me) and said, &quot;Listen to this, it'll blow your minds,&quot;\nbut it feels more like a fluke collision between Faris Badwan's\nsonorous baritone, those symphonic 80s synthesisers that sound like\ncollapsing ice shelves, and the band's never-better grasp of how to\ncraft handsome, dramatic pop songs.\n\nSo the superficial echoes of the Chameleons, the Psychedelic Furs and\nJohn Hughes's anglophile high-school movie soundtracks feel almost\naccidental. The album's restless dynamism owes much more to the\nescapist rush of dance music and the muscular end of shoegazing.\nEndless Blue opens like the Cure lazing on a riverbank before an\namp-bursting explosion of guitars as sudden and effective as a\nhorror-movie twist. Wild Eyed melts woozily into reversed loops and\nchirpy brass. The magnificent trance-rock centerpiece Moving Further\nAway even explores some of the same territory as the Chemical Brothers\nor LCD Soundsystem. During its long, dizzying breakdown, synthesisers\nduel with a sample of a flock of seagulls (not, let's be perfectly\nclear, A Flock of Seagulls), before the band crash back in for a\nhammering finale. The music sounds vast, yet interior, as if its ideal\nvenue weren't an arena or a festival field, but an expanding head.\n\nSkying's starry-eyed, cosmic leanings are complicated by Badwan's\nslippery, sepulchral presence. He's the skull at the happening. When\nhe's not singing about skies and oceans, or delivering ecstatic\ncommands to &quot;open your eyes&quot; (Changing the Rain) or declaring &quot;the\nmoment that you want is coming if you give it time&quot; (Still Life), he\ncan sound paranoid and vengeful. I Can See Through You routes the\nemotional cruelty of the Cat's Eyes album via a bad acid trip,\ntaunting: &quot;No one remembers your name, no one tries.&quot; He sounds almost\nderanged on Monica Gems, an itchy, urgent racket that suggests\nglam-rock produced by Kevin Shields.\n\nSuch shorthand descriptions are hard to avoid entirely, and music buffs\nmight still want to play spot the influence with Skying ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ one reviewer\ndetected seven in the opening song alone ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but that would undersell\nthis marvellous record, which should be every bit as exciting to a\nlistener who knows none of those reference points. So never mind the\npast: the records the Horrors love aren't destinations, but signposts\nto an exhilarating future.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a28f55db082994399d23d43317e93ec6e147e4f","amp;dn":"The+Horrors-Skying-2011-SiRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a28f55db082994399d23d43317e93ec6e147e4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,40,245,93,176,130,153,67,153,210,61,67,49,126,147,236,110,20,126,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
