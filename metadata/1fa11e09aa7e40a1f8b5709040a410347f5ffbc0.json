Like Adam and Eve, they \nproduce children of incest who create their own primitive society complete with \nrival tribe factions and arcane ceremonies that celebrate the oldest surviving \nspaceman (Jerzy Trela) as a god. The mystical locales, with their grim white sands \nand melancholy gray-blue skies, set an appropriately nightmarish atmosphere, and \nthe wardrobe of pagan headdresses and ornate embroideries are like the gothic \nfever-dream flipside of the hippie summer of love.\n\nKicking into an even more feverish gear, a lone astronaut named Marek (Andrzej \nSeweryn) arrives to gather information on what happened to the original colonies. \nHis ill-fated rescue mission gives way to surrender as the tribes praise him as \ntheir champion defender against the monstrous and fascistic winged raven-black \ncreatures that have enslaved them. Imagine The Last Temptation of Christ set \nwithin the post-apocalyptic wreckage zone of Stalker. Zulawski's most notable \nvisuals include desperate pre-war orgies, a crucifixion that lifts the doomed \nmessiah 60 feet into the air, and the camera spiraling up gigantic spikes with \nvictims impaled upon them like savage Medieval offerings. Absurd and extreme but \nnever morbid, this European shock-cinema offering goes so far overboard in its \nexcess that it becomes a bleak comic spit into the face of organized religion, \norganized society, and even organized narrative. It is completely out of control, \nalmost joyfully so, like a child knocking over sandcastles. As Zulawski says, \n&quot;The key to unhappiness is to control.&quot;\n\nZulawski's movies tackle big ideas, and if Possession is about the aching pain \nof love, On the Silver Globe takes raging philosophical bites on the subject of \nethical freedom. Zulawski believes we are all unhappy, creating the image of God \nso that we can tear it down again, or kill, or fulfill our hungers and be forgiven. \nHeavy stuff, to be sure, but he expresses his thoughts through primal, kinetic images, \nwith a restless camera shoving its way forward into scenes like a parasite and \ncharacters descending into caustic fits of love and hate. His films don't seem like\nponderous intellectual exercises, but highly emotional gut responsesÃƒÂ«Ã‚Â¾Ã…Â¾nd endlessly \nfascinating because we just aren't used to seeing that much spirited, hyperactive, \nshrieking human feeling on screen at one time. When it's all over, it feels like \nyou've been through a cleansing sweat of tears. Viewers willing to jump into the \nZulawski abyss are encouraged to buckle their seatbelts and bring their crash helmets, \nbecause it's a wild and bumpy trip down.\n\n[ IMdB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093593/ | Rating: 7.0 / 10 (189 votes) ]\n                                     \n[ General ]===================================\n                                                                  \nComplete name                    : On.The.Silver.Globe.1988.DVDRip.x264.AC3-KARiNA.mkv\nFormat                           : Matroska\nFile size                        : 2.45 GiB\nDuration                         : 2h 37mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 2 226 Kbps\nSource                           : Telewizja Kino Polska PAL DVD9\n\n[ Video ]=====================================\n\nFormat                           : AVC\nCodec ID                         : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nBit rate                         : 1 957 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                 : 2 000 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 576 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4/3\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nStandard                         : PAL\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.189\nStream size                      : 2.15 GiB (88%)\nTitle                            : Track 1\nWriting library                  : x264 core 65\n\n[ Audio ]=====================================                              \n\nFormat                           : AC-3\nCodec ID                         : A_AC3\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 224 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 252 MiB (10%)\nTitle                            : Track 1\nLanguage                         : Polish\n\n[ Subtitles ]=================================\n\nFormat                           : UTF-8\nCodec ID                         : S_TEXT/UTF8\nTitle                            : Track 1\nLanguage                         : English\n\n[ Chapters ]==================================\n\n00:00:00.000                     : :Chapter 1\n00:09:44.880                     : :Chapter 2\n00:19:05.320                     : :Chapter 3\n00:28:03.200                     : :Chapter 4\n00:34:42.360                     : :Chapter 5\n00:47:51.000                     : :Chapter 6\n00:58:25.160                     : :Chapter 7\n01:08:42.040                     : :Chapter 8\n01:21:32.640                     : :Chapter 9\n01:29:14.080                     : :Chapter 10\n01:37:59.960                     : :Chapter 11\n01:50:17.200                     : :Chapter 12\n02:03:55.000                     : :Chapter 13\n02:10:25.240                     : :Chapter 14\n02:20:32.760                     : :Chapter 15\n02:28:48.400                     : :Chapter 16\n\n[ KARiNA ]===================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fa11e09aa7e40a1f8b5709040a410347f5ffbc0","amp;dn":"On.The.Silver.Globe.1988.DVDRip.x264.AC3-KARiNA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fa11e09aa7e40a1f8b5709040a410347f5ffbc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,161,30,9,170,126,64,161,248,181,112,144,64,164,16,52,127,95,251,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
