PROTECTION: Arxan+Custom+Steam\r\n1: DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE: Action, Adventure\r\n\r\nIt's 1968 and after years of combat in Vietnam, Lincoln Clay knows this\r\ntruth: family isn't who you're born with, it's who you die for\r\n\r\nProper Note:\r\n\r\nSo here we are again. Another proper. And by proper we obviously mean\r\ntrolling; harassment\r\n\r\nBecause this is what it has come to be about. Bitter and jaded old men in a\r\nsick sort of last man standing contest, demanding that they're right, and\r\nbelieving that they're in control. That everybody else is wrong and only\r\nout to sabotage them. Pretending that their ego is so, so big, to cover that\r\nit's so tiny as to barely be noticeable. Just waiting for the opportunity to\r\nhawk on someone else. Desperately trying to make the claim that the other\r\ngroups release is :shit: they're the true lamers, and liars to boot!\r\n\r\nMaybe their release IS :shit: ? Maybe their crack is in fact a potpourri of\r\nhacked up and badly written code, &quot;inspired&quot; by those they claim to resent\r\nor straight up copied from others. Maybe they ARE indeed dishonest. Making\r\nup rulesets that nobody agreed to, referencing them only when it suits them\r\nTrying to manipulate behind the curtains a concept so laughable as a\r\nnukenet. Using updated versions of a game to make claims of bad cracks, when\r\nthe updated version was a bugfix. Or maybe they're actual :shit: heads, their\r\nskulls literally filled to the brim with feces\r\n\r\nOr maybe... Oh damn, where was I? Right\r\n\r\nThe CODEX release doesn't work for everybody. On certain systems and setups\r\nthe game just doesn't launch, whereas with our release, it does. No, we're\r\nnot going to help them by pointing out how and why, aka providing &quot;proof&quot; :wink:\r\n\r\nThe updated v1.01 game is included in our pack, but we make no claim to have\r\nunlocked FPS, nor that this in itself might fix anything release or crack\r\nrelated\r\n\r\nBut, to top it all off, we present you with a release that contains a crack\r\nwhich features an Arxan-rebuilt exe. Make of that what you will\r\n\r\nAnd most of all: Enjoy and HAVE FUN! :D\r\n\r\nTEAM RLD 2016\r\n\r\n1. Unrar\r\n2. Burn or mount the image\r\n3. Install the game\r\n4. Copy over the cracked content from the /Crack directory on the image to\r\nyour game install directory\r\n5. Play the game\r\n6. Support the software developers.
