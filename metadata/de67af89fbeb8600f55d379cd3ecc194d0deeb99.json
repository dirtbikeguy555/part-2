Open the .dmg file and install the game normally.\n2. Crack the game with the included crack by Blade.\n3. update version 1.4 of HOMM5 with the included patcher to make it V1.5\n\nplay the game!!\n\n------------------------\n\nKnown issues:  there are some saving glitches with v1.4\nsolution: patch with included patcher or don&amp;#039;t use [spaces] in your player name\n\nSome people report crashes at the end of some campaigns or after about 1-2 hours gameplay.  my guess is that their machines aren&amp;#039;t up to the task/ they haven&amp;#039;t patched the game in the right order.\n\nPlease post any solutions or problems here so we can solve them all\nthanks!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de67af89fbeb8600f55d379cd3ecc194d0deeb99","amp;dn":"%5BMag+Game%5D+Heroes+of+Might+and+Magic+V","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de67af89fbeb8600f55d379cd3ecc194d0deeb99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,103,175,137,251,235,134,0,245,93,55,156,211,236,193,148,208,222,235,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
