Its title is a quotation of a remark made by the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's 1894 short story &quot;Silver Blaze&quot;.\nThe story is written in the first-person narrative of Christopher John Francis Boone, a 15-year-old autistic boy living in Swindon, Wiltshire. Although Christopher's condition within the autism spectrum is not stated explicitly within the novel, the summary on the book's inside cover describes it as Asperger syndrome.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc69daabc7ba64611752f6047abe2e1fc0c5e95b","amp;dn":"The+Curious+Incident+Of+The+Dog+In+The+Night+Time+By+Mark+Haddon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc69daabc7ba64611752f6047abe2e1fc0c5e95b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,105,218,171,199,186,100,97,23,82,246,4,122,190,46,31,192,197,233,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
