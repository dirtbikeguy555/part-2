Part I progresses seamlessly from basic cardiac A&amp;P through waves and complexes, lead morphology, and rhythms. Part II covers 12-lead interpretation, axis, hypertrophy, myocardial infarction, and more. The text presents many clinical scenarios, anecdotes, and critical thinking exercises, plus hundreds of practice rhythm strips and 12-lead EKGs. This edition adds new scenarios, chapter notes, and tables; more medication information; and new coverage ranging from MI symptoms to hemiblocks.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c8cbc0d8d0f9f7094f1184c34397c941c6329d4","amp;dn":"EKG+Plain+and+Simple%2C+3E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c8cbc0d8d0f9f7094f1184c34397c941c6329d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,140,188,13,141,15,159,112,148,241,24,76,52,57,124,148,28,99,41,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
