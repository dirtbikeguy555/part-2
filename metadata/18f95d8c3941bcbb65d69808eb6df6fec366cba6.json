How about that diabetics shouldn't eat a lot of fruit? What about that eating too much fruit sugar might give you diabetes? These all-too-common beliefs are about to be explored...and exposed for the myths they really are. In this revolutionary book, you will meet five courageous individuals who have healed their bodies, eliminated the need for diabetic medications, achieved excellent HbA1c's and blood sugar readings, and, in effect, reversed their type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes diagnoses...all while eating a diet mainly comprised of FRUIT! If they can heal diabetes with fruit, why should anyone else be afraid of it? These in-depth interviews answer all the commonly-asked questions and objections about diabetes and fruit. In this book you will find answers from ex-diabetics about food choices, blood tests, lab results, interaction with doctors, transition details, health improvements, tips for beginners, and much, much more. These honest and vulnerable interviews give the reader a thorough understanding of what is involved in becoming an ex-type 2 diabetic. My name is Tasha Lee. I have had type 1 diabetes for 25 years. Since my diagnosis, I have regularly visited endocrinologists and received a thorough diabetes education from practitioners of traditional medicine. I have read diabetes books, magazines, and websites; I have participated in diabetes camps, support groups, and online forums. Suffice it to say, I understand the popular approaches to management of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. By Ã¢â‚¬Å“going against the grainÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and transitioning to a fruit-based diet and healthy lifestyle, I personally have made significant improvements in insulin sensitivity, blood sugar control, and overall health. Unlike so many others, I don't see fruit as &quot;the bad guy&quot; when it comes to diabetes. On the contrary, following a fruit-based diet has allowed me to have the best diabetes management of my life. I wouldn't wish diabetes on anyone, and to find out that type 2 could be healed--and rather quickly--on a low-fat, plant-based diet, I was ecstatic! I wanted to share this hope with the world. I am so blessed to have met these five individuals willing to share their diabetes reversal stories in this book. I can't wait for you to be blessed, and your life changed by them, as well","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18f95d8c3941bcbb65d69808eb6df6fec366cba6","amp;dn":"Healing+Diabetes+With+Fruit+-+Tasha+Lee","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18f95d8c3941bcbb65d69808eb6df6fec366cba6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,249,93,140,57,65,188,187,101,214,152,8,235,109,246,254,195,102,203,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
