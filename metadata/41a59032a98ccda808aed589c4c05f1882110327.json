SAID (1935-2003) was a Palestinian-American academic, cultural critic, literary theorist, journalist, and public intellectual.\n\nSaid is best known for ORIENTALISM (1978), an analysis of the cultural representations that are the bases of Orientalism, a term he redefined to mean the Western study of Eastern cultures and, in general, the framework of how The West perceives and (mis)represents The East. He contended that Orientalist scholarship was, and remains, inextricably tied to the imperialist societies that produced it, which makes much of the work inherently political, servile to power, and therefore intellectually suspect. The book was hugely influential in the humanities, especially in postcolonial studies, literary theory and in literary criticism.\n\nAs a public intellectual, Said discussed contemporary politics and culture, literature and music in books, lectures, and articles. He was a tireless advocate for the establishment of a Palestinian state, for equal political and human rights for the Palestinians in Israel, and for increased U.S. political pressure upon Israel to recognize, grant, and respect said rights. Moreover, he also criticized the political and cultural politics of the Arab and Muslim regimes who acted against the interests of their peoples.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF and/or ePUB formats as indicated:\n\n* COVERING ISLAM: How the Media and the Experts Determine How We See the Rest of the World (Vintage, 1997).
