In this age of dramatic technological advancement, Vandercroft was fascinated by how the rise of steam technology at the start of the American Civil War had transformed warfare and the role of the fighting man. This volume collects all of Vandercroftâ€™s surviving paintings, along with his associated commentary on the specific military units he encountered.\r\n\r\nSteampunk Soldiers: Uniforms &amp; Weapons from the Age of Steam by Philip Smith, Joseph A.
