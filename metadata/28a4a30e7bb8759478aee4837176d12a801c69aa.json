A limited edition version was also released at the same time, containing two bonus tracks and including a free woven patch.\n\n[edit] Track listing\n\n   1. &quot;Pre-Game&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 0:39\n   2. &quot;The Art of Partying&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 2:04\n   3. &quot;Headbanger Face Rip&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 1:51\n   4. &quot;Mental Shock&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 1:48\n   5. &quot;A.D.D.

And Business Is Good&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 0:49\n  17. &quot;I Just Wanna Rock&quot; ÃƒÂ¢?? 2:09\n\nAll songs written by Municipal Waste. Tracks 16 &amp; 17 are bonus tracks on the limited edition version of the album. The track &quot;Mental Shock&quot; is subtitled &quot;(Death Ripper Part II)&quot; in the liner notes, and is presumably a continuation of the song &quot;Death Ripper&quot; from Hazardous Mutation. &quot;Born to Party&quot; is a rerecorded version of the song that appeared on an early split 7&quot;, and is probably intentionally 4:20 long. Much like the previous two Municipal Waste albums, the last song (on the regular version), &quot;Born to Party&quot;, contains a joke hidden track after a period of silence; a recording of the band performing a song in a radically different genre from the rest of their output.\n\nThe cover is a visual representation of the song Chemically Altered.\n\n[edit] Personell\n\n    * Tony &quot;Guardrail&quot; Foresta ÃƒÂ¢??
