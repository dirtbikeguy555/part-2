It provides a high-productivity programming model that promotes cleaner code architecture, test-driven development, and powerful extensibility, combined with all the benefits of ASP.NET.\n\nASP.NET MVC 4 contains a number of significant advances over previous versions. New mobile and desktop templates (employing adaptive rendering) are included together with support for jQuery Mobile for the first time. New display modes allow your application to select views based on the browser thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s making the request while Code Generation Recipes for Visual Studio help you auto-generate project-specific code for a wide variety of situtations including NuGet support.\n\nIn this fourth edition, the core model-view-controller (MVC) architectural concepts are not simply explained or discussed in isolation, but are demonstrated in action. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll work through an extended tutorial to create a working e-commerce web application that combines ASP.NET MVC with the latest C# language features and unit-testing best practices. By gaining this invaluable, practical experience, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll discover MVCÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strengths and weaknesses for yourselfÃ¢â‚¬â€and put your best-learned theory into practice.\n\nThe bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s authors, Steve Sanderson and Adam Freeman, have both watched the growth of ASP.NET MVC since its first release. Steve is a well-known blogger on the MVC Framework and a member of the Microsoft Web Platform and Tools team. Adam started designing and building web applications 15 years ago and has been responsible for some of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largest and most ambitious projects. You can be sure you are in safe hands.\n\nWhat youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn\n- Gain a solid architectural understanding of ASP.NET MVC 4, including basic MVC\n- Explore the entire ASP.NET MVC Framework\n- Learn whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new in version 4 and how how best to apply these new features\n- See how MVC and test-driven development work in action\n- Capitalize on your existing knowledge quickly and easily through comparison of features in classic ASP.NET to those in ASP.NET MVC\n\nWho this book is for\nThis book is for web developers with a basic knowledge of ASP.NET and C# who want (or need) to start using the new ASP.NET MVC 4 Framework.\n\nBook Details\nPaperback: 756 pages\nPublisher: Apress; 4th Edition (December 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1430242361\nISBN-13: 978-1430242369","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4409d64462c4b5684fa767c670aaa85bc2a2d162","amp;dn":"Pro+ASP.NET+MVC+4+4th+Edition+V413HAV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4409d64462c4b5684fa767c670aaa85bc2a2d162","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,9,214,68,98,196,181,104,79,167,103,198,112,170,168,91,194,162,209,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
