As an outsider, Mork is unfamiliar with human customs and often questions some of the strange traditions that we take for granted. Much of the humor relies on Williams' unique comic voices and mannerisms. The show was perhaps most famous for Mork's greeting, 'Nanu Nanu.' \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077053/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077053/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll 4 seasons \n\nEnjoy the show and RIP Robin Williams. You will always be remembered.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38c77714bd8f8d87d37396f6c654703d512868bd","amp;dn":"Mork+and+Mindy+-+Season+1-4+%5BDVDRip%5D+%5BXviD%5D+-+cOOt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38c77714bd8f8d87d37396f6c654703d512868bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,199,119,20,189,143,141,135,211,115,150,246,198,84,112,61,81,40,104,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
