They began to incorporate the talent and imagination of friend\nand guitarist John Jeffers. At that time, they called themselves Lucky Southern,\nthough they had only three members. As time passed, with their inspiration\nmounting, they moved to Tyler, Texas. There they met up with Jeff Hogg, a mutual\nfriend and drummer from Palestine, Texas, and Gary Brown, a bass guitarist who\nhad grown up in Neches, Texas. They came together and came to be known as\nWhiskey Myers. Soon, the group was playing private parties on flatbed trailers\nin small towns around East Texas. The sound they emitted was something more\nunique than anyone had expected. From their first show in Montalba, Texas, a\nyoung Whiskey Myers was hooked on performing, and the crowds were hooked on\nthem. In the spring of 2007, they were given the opportunity to open for Roger\nCreager at Gator s Bar and Grill in Gun Barrel City, Texas. The club owner was\nso impressed by their performance and the crowd that had come to the stage that\nhe asked them to come back the next weekend to open for The Eli Young Band. From\nthen on, popularity for the band began to swell. They were heard on live stages\nall over East Texas, in interviews on local radio stations, and seen on\ntelevision giving live interviews. Suddenly it seemed that the whole region knew\nwho Whiskey Myers was, and everyone was becoming familiar with their high energy\ntwin guitars, soulful vocals, and unstoppable rhythm. Whiskey Myers musical\nstyle was forged from several different genres of music from several different\neras. The most obvious of these are the blues rock jam bands such as Lynyrd\nSkynyrd, The Allman Brothers Band, and Led Zeppelin. Whiskey Myers takes the\nblues rock genre and mixes it with modern day Texas Country such as Reckless\nKelly, Randy Rogers, and Cross Canadian Ragweed to derive a new sound that is\nsure to take concert listeners on an atmospheric roller coaster. With a sound\nlike no other and a stage presence that captivates anyone close enough to\nnotice, a live concert performed by this young band is something that must be\nseen to be believed. The Tyler area has been instrumental in the development of\nWhiskey Myers from a group of musicians to a band. As the group continues to\nexpand its fan base, new listeners all over Texas are beginning to recognize\ntheir talent. They continue to engulf listeners with their sound, ensuring that\nthe name Whiskey Myers is one that will be remembered for ages to come.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed506bd640893b283f820afd52e7925a7f537a70","amp;dn":"Whiskey_Myers-Firewater-2011-404","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed506bd640893b283f820afd52e7925a7f537a70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,80,107,214,64,137,59,40,63,130,10,253,82,231,146,90,127,83,122,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
