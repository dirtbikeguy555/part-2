The band is made up of Marcus Mumford (vocals, guitar, drums, mandolin), Ben Lovett (vocals, keyboards, accordion), &quot;Country&quot; Winston Marshall (vocals, banjo, dobro), and Ted Dwane (vocals, string bass). Although the band members have claims on certain instruments, the members switch instruments during live shows according to convenience, for they each play a variety of instruments. The band formed in late 2007, rising out of London's folk scene with other artists such as Laura Marling, Johnny Flynn and Noah and the Whale.\n\nThe band has often supported Laura Marling at concerts, while their association with Noah and the Whale can be traced back to St Paul's School, Barnes and King's College School, Wimbledon. Mumford and Lovett attended King's College School alongside Noah and the Whale bassist Matt Owens, while Marshall attended St Paul's School along with Charlie Fink, lead singer of Noah and the Whale.\n\nThe band's debut album, Sigh No More, was released in the United Kingdom in October 2009, and February 2010 in the United States. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumford_%26_Sons&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumford_%26_Sons&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nSigh No More is the debut studio album by London-based folk-rock quartet Mumford &amp; Sons. It was released on October 5, 2009 in the UK, and on February 16, 2010 in the United States and Canada. The album entered the UK Albums Chart at #11 on 11 October and has so far peaked at #3 on 10 October 2010, precisely a year after it first entered the chart. The album also reached #1 in Australia, after spending 17 weeks previously in the charts, and has been certified double platinum there. On the 5th March 2010 the album certified Platinum in the UK. In mid-2010, it was rated the year-to-date's 8th best record on NPR's All Songs Considered. On 20 July 2010, it was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize, awarded annually for the best album in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The award was given to The xx's self-titled album. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigh_No_More_%28Mumford_%26_Sons_album%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigh_No_More_%28Mumford_%26_Sons_album%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nCD 1\n\n01 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Sigh No More\n02 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ The Cave\n03 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Winter Winds\n04 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Roll Away Your Stone\n05 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ White Blank Page\n06 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ I Gave You All\n07 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Little Lion Man\n08 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Timshel\n09 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Thistle &amp; Weeds\n10 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Awake My Soul\n11 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Dust Bowl Dance\n12 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ After the Storm\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nCD 2 Bonus Disc\n\n01 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Sigh No More (Live)\n02 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Winter Winds (Live)\n03 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Roll Away Your Stone (Live)\n04 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ White Blank Page (Live)\n05 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ I Gave You All (Live)\n06 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Awake My Soul\n07 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Little Lion Man (Live)\n08 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Thistle &amp; Weeds (Live)\n09 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Timshel (Live)\n10 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ The Cave (Live)\n11 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Dust Bowl Dance (Live)\n12 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ Feel The Tide (Live)\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info:\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mumfordandsons.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mumfordandsons.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mumfordandsons.com/blog/announcement-2-the-arrival-of-sigh-no-more-deluxe-the-latest-from-mands-hq-towers-and-more&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mumfordandsons.com/blog/announcement-2-the-arrival-of-sigh-no-more-deluxe-the-latest-from-mands-hq-towers-and-more&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumford_%26_Sons&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumford_%26_Sons&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigh_No_More_%28Mumford_%26_Sons_album%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigh_No_More_%28Mumford_%26_Sons_album%29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENJOY AND NEEDLESS TO SAY: KEEP SEEDING FOR OTHERS!!!\nTHANKS!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e11d0e28f7c29850226edb81c94a5ffb20ae108","amp;dn":"Mumford+%26+Sons+-+Sigh+No+More+%282010%29%28Deluxe+2CD+Edition%29%28Bonus+L","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e11d0e28f7c29850226edb81c94a5ffb20ae108","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,17,208,226,143,124,41,133,2,38,237,184,28,148,165,255,178,10,225,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
