Born on April 21, 1947, in Muskegon, MI, James Newell Osterberg was raised by his parents in a trailer park close to Ann Arbor, in nearby Ypsilanti. Intrigued by rock &amp; roll (as well as such non-musical, monotonous, and mechanical sounds as his father's electric razor and the local automobile assembly plants in Detroit), Osterberg began playing drums and formed his first band, the Iguanas, in the early '60s. Via the Rolling Stones, Osterberg discovered the blues and formed a similarly styled outfit, called the Prime Movers, upon graduating from high school in 1965. When a brief stint at the University of Michigan didn't work out, he moved to Chicago instead, where he played drums alongside the city's bluesmen.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tAlternative\nSource:\t\t\tWeb\n\n01.Lust For Life\n02.The Passenger\n03.Nightclubbing\n04.Tell Me A Story\n05.New Values\n06.Girls\n07.I'm Bored\n08.Five Foot One\n09.Loco Mosquito\n10.Knocking 'em Down (In The City)\n11.Pumpin' For Jill\n12.Bang Bang\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b434d05002ae83751cc9e606b4b712a2b587a5d","amp;dn":"Iggy+Pop+-+Platinum+%26+Gold+Collection+%282004%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b434d05002ae83751cc9e606b4b712a2b587a5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,67,77,5,0,42,232,55,81,204,158,96,107,75,113,42,43,88,122,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
