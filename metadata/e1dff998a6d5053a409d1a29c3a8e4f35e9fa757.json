This is pretty much the only thing theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve got in common with any other emerging British band right now. We say ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“emergingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, but the Edinburgh art-pop foursome first started garnering new band fizz in 2009. A three-year gestation of hype to album delivery would normally be as fatal to a band as their singer being run over by an articulated truck, but Django Django have emerged from their pupal stage showing off a blinding array of colours, and their debut album takes flight bound for somewhere new. \n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not, though, somewhere entirely without precedent. The major inspiration on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Django DjangoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ would appear to be the works of The Beta Band. Yup, for some bands The Libertines are Day One. For others itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the Stones. For Django Django, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the now-defunct Scottish indie semi-legends who were as much characterised by their muddy, spliff-friendly tones as their intrepid, far-sighted eclecticism.\n\nFunnily enough, there is a family connection ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Django bandleader David Maclean is the younger brother of Betas keyboardist John Maclean. Even so, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve moved on from their predecessorsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ sofa-bound outlook on life. The rootsy acoustic scrapes, sneaker-shuffling rhythms, echo-slung vocals ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ all Beta trademarks. But Django make an itchy, Vitamin D-saturated music that grabs hold of their inner stoner, hauls him off the settee and catapults him out into the blazing sunshine.\n\nWe begin with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Hail BopÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, a baffling mix of tribal drums, electro-whooshes and cowboy whistles and cricket chirrups. This gives way to the kind of irresistible chant-chorus that peppers the entire album, and ensures that, as far as envelopes are being pushed stylistically, the finished product always hits your lap sounding dead-on immediate. There are echoes of Hot Chip in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Hand Of ManÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, while ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“LoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s DartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is drum machine-bedded acoustic fingerpicking sliced from the most tender parts of Gruff RhysÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ brain. Out in front, though, is the Tarantino-theme-via-Calexico bounce of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“LifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s A BeachÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ as immediate an anthem as youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re going to get from a band who clearly have the attention span of month-old puppies. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s an album characterised by its sharp stylistic swerves, but never feels jumbled or incoherent. \n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a dream of the psychedelic tropics, a heady explosion of colours, an album that takes what it means to be ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“in an indie bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and gives it a good shake. Time to pay a visit.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1dff998a6d5053a409d1a29c3a8e4f35e9fa757","amp;dn":"Django+Django+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1dff998a6d5053a409d1a29c3a8e4f35e9fa757","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,223,249,152,166,213,5,58,64,157,26,41,195,168,228,243,94,159,167,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
