Phipps - The Secrets of Supervillainy (The Supervillainy Saga #3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMerciless, the Supervillain without Mercy (TM), is back with even bigger problems! How far will he go to fix his wife's current state of being a soulless vampire? Can he ignore his growing feelings for Cindy, despite their difference over the new Star Wars movie? Can he survive the wrath of the president of the United States (whom he accidentally stole billions from)?\r\n\r\nWhile he ponders those personal issues, Death has a new mission for him. The greatest hero on Earth has killed, and she isn't pleased. Death wants the murder solved and the perpetrator given the kind of justice only the Avatar of Death can dish out. Unfortunately for Gary, that's only the tip of the psychotic iceberg.\r\n\r\nRead by Jeffrey Kafer\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d64c4ce8f3eaf3bad55431c8b061d7657935f074","amp;dn":"+C.T.+Phipps+-+The+Secrets+of+Supervillainy+%28Supervillainy+%233%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d64c4ce8f3eaf3bad55431c8b061d7657935f074","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,76,76,232,243,234,243,186,213,84,49,200,176,97,215,101,121,53,240,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
