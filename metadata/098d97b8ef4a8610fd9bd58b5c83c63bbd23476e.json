Instead, Sandboxie isolates and quarantines the outcome of whatever the Web site may do to your computer, including the installation of unsolicited software. \n\nSandboxie has originally been designed to increase the security of browsing with Internet Explorer, however it is just as effective with any other browser, and in fact, any other program. Sandboxie wraps a protection layer around the programs it supervises. It is this layer that intercepts and isolates any changes the programs make to the computer. And this layer is impartial to the specific program it wraps. \n\nSandboxie was designed as an application that will allow you to isolate and quarantine websites.\n\n\nBenefits:\n- Secure Web Browsing: Running your Web browser under the protection of Sandboxie means that all malicious software downloaded by the browser is trapped in the sandbox and can be discarded trivially.\n\n- Enhanced Privacy: Browsing history, cookies, and cached temporary files collected while Web browsing stay in the sandbox and don't leak into Windows.\n\n- Secure E-mail: Viruses and other malicious software that might be hiding in your email can't break out of the sandbox and can't infect your real system.\n\n- Windows Stays Lean: Prevent wear-and-tear in Windows by installing software into an isolated sandbox.\n\n\nWhat's New in Version 4.12 (20 May, 2014):\n- The MS Visual C++ redistributable libraries have been broken out into a separate download. These now download and install during the Sandboxie install. Installing them this way will enable them to be automatically updated by Windows Update should MS issue any hotfixes\n- The auto-update feature is working again\n- The Portuguese (Portugal) language has been fixed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:098d97b8ef4a8610fd9bd58b5c83c63bbd23476e","amp;dn":"Sandboxie+v4.12+Final+ML+%28x86%2Fx64%29+%2B+Crack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"098d97b8ef4a8610fd9bd58b5c83c63bbd23476e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,141,151,184,239,74,134,16,253,155,213,139,92,131,198,59,189,35,71,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
