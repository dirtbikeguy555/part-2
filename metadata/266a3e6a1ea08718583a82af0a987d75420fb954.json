Now you can take your file sharing to the next level \nwith MacDrive Pro. For over 15 years, MacDrive has enabled PC users \nto access Mac disks in Windows. MacDrive Pro includes all of \nMacDrive StandardÃƒâ€ s features, including fast and reliable control \nof all your Mac disks. You can open, edit, save and even format, \npartition and repair Mac disks. MacDrive Pro builds on MacDriveÃƒâ€ s \nstandard features and gives you more power and more tools to get \nyour work done faster and easier.\n\nAccess Apple RAID sets\nFor the first time ever, Windows users can access Apple RAID sets \nstraight from their PC. Professionals and power users who need improved \nperformance and reliability have used Apple RAID for years, and now \nwith MacDrive Pro, those disks can be shared with Windows. MacDrive Pro \nopens up a whole new realm of cross-platform computing.\n\nFaster than ever\nMacDrive has always placed a high priority on speed and compatibility. \nMacDrive is now even faster and more configurable, giving you the ability \nto fine-tune MacDrive for your workload. Increased speed means you get \nyour work done fasterÃƒÂ¹saving you time and money.\n\nFormat, Partition, Repair\nWeÃƒâ€ ve streamlined the Mac Disk Manager, making it even easier to format \nand partition your Mac disks and hard drives. WeÃƒâ€ ve even improved \nMacDriveÃƒâ€ s repair disk feature, so your data is safer than ever.\n\nBurn Mac-formatted CDs and DVDs\nAlong with the ability to format Mac disks from your PC, you can use \nMacDriveÃƒâ€ s CD/DVD Creator to burn Mac CDs and DVDs with ease.\n\nQuick Start Launcher\nMacDrive has always been a simple, seamless utility for sharing files \nbetween Mac disks and Windows.

The best \nway to increase speed is to have a clean disk. MacDrive Pro takes this a step \nfurther with the new built-in auto defrag that constantly optimizes your files \nto keep them lean and mean.\n\nMore options to save\nCDs and DVDs are a great way to save information, but if you need to save a \nlarge amount of data to a disc, Blu-ray is the way to go.
