Use of macros allows students and engineers to control complex electronic devices without getting bogged down in understanding the details of programming.\n\nFlowcode is used in education as a means of introducing students to the concepts of programming.\n\nFlowcode is used in the industry for rapid development and for managing large projects.\n\nTested work!\nCrack included!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b494ba3eaeb0a59db04901f65b407530740945be","amp;dn":"Flowcode+V5+AVR+Tested+100%25+work%21+V5.3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b494ba3eaeb0a59db04901f65b407530740945be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,148,186,62,174,176,165,157,176,73,1,246,91,64,117,48,116,9,69,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
