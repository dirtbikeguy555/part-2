Their goal is to see people encounter God, be transformed by His presence and empowered to make a difference in their world. While they tour internationally, the team remains based out of Planetshakers City Church, a multi-campus, 7,800-member congregation in Melbourne that is pastored by husband and wife, Russell and Sam Evans.  The church is the fastest growing church in Australian history.\n\n\nArtist: Planetshakers\nAlbum: Limitless\nRelease Date: January 15, 2013\nGenres: Praise &amp; Worship\nFormat | Bitrate: MP3 | 320 Kbps\nSize: 166 Mb\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
