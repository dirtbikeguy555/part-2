The Long Island Trio's 1989 Debut Album, 3 Feet High &amp; Rising, Single-Handedly Did More To Popularise Rap Music Outside The Genre's Core Audience Base Than Any Other Record To That Point, But The Band Have Been Made To Pay A Heavy Price For Helping Make Hip-Hop One Of The Biggest Selling Sectors In Popular Music. \nThis Collection Gives The Band's Legacy A Stereotypical Overview. There Are Two Discs, But The Second Half Is Given Over To Collaborations And Remixes. It's Also A Limited Edition; So Many Buyers Will Only Get The First Half, And Will Therefore Hear Only A Patchy Summation Of De La Soul's Story So Far. \n\nAdmittedly, Every Track Is Exceptional, Giving A Consistently High-Quality Listen, But The Balance Is Askew. Six Tracks From 3 Feet High &amp; Rising Is Understandable, But Almost Ignoring The Mainstream-Shunned, Underground-Loved Buhloone Mindstate And Stakes Is High Albums Is Short-Sighted. De La Soul Are Hip-Hop's Prince, Widely Praised For Things They Did Years Ago, Their New Work Subjected To Unfairly Slanted Comparisons With Their Debut. But The Best Of De La Soul Is Almost Certainly Yet To Come.\n\n\n\nDisc 01\n\n[01] Me Myself And I \t\t\t\t- (Radio Version)\n[02] Say No Go\t\t\t\t\t\n[03] Eye Know\t\t\t\t\t\n[04] The Magic Number\t\t\t\t\n[05] Potholes In My Lawn \t\t\t\t- (12&quot; Vocal Version)\n[06] Buddy\t\t\t\t\t- Featuring Jungle Brothers, Q-Tip &amp; Phife\n[07] Ring Ring Ring (Ha Ha Hey) \t\t\t- (UK 7&quot; Edit)\n[08] A Roller Skating Jam Named &quot;Saturdays&quot;\t\n[09] Keepin' The Faith\t\t\t\t\n[10] Breakadawn\t\t\t\t\t\n[11] Stakes Is High\t\t\t\t\n[12] 4 More\t\t\t\t\t- Featuring Zhane\n[13] Oooh \t\t\t\t\t- Featuring Redman (Original Version)\n[14] All Good?\t\t\t\t\t- Featuring Chaka Khan\n[15] Thru Ya City\t\t\t\t\t- Featuring D.V.
