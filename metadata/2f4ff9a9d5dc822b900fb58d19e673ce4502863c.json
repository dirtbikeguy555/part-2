Moon Called (Mercy Thompson, #1) - Patricia Briggs\n\nMercedes &quot;Mercy&quot; Thompson is a talented Volkswagen mechanic living in the Tri-Cities area of Washington. She also happens to be a walker, a magical being with the power to shift into a coyote at will. Mercy's next-door neighbor is a werewolf. Her former boss is a gremlin. And she's fixing a bus for a vampire. This is the world of Mercy Thompson, one that looks a lot like ours but is populated by those things that go bump in the night. And Mercy's connection to those things is about to get her into some serious hot water...\n\n\n02. Blood Bound (Mercy Thompson, #2) - Patricia Briggs\n\nUnder the rule of science, there are no witch burnings allowed, no water trials or public lynchings. In return, the average law-abiding, solid citizen has little to worry about from the things that go bump in the night. Sometimes I wish I was an average citizen...\n\nMechanic Mercy Thompson has friends in low places-and in dark ones. And now she owes one of them a favor. Since she can shapeshift at will, she agrees to act as some extra muscle when her vampire friend Stefan goes to deliver a message to another of his kind.\n\nBut this new vampire is hardly ordinary-and neither is the demon inside of him.\n\n\n03. Iron Kissed (Mercy Thompson, #3) - Patricia Briggs\n\nI could smell her fear, and it satisfied something deep inside me that had been writhing under her cool, superior gaze. I curled my upper lip so she could get a good look at my sharp teeth. I might only weigh thirty or so pounds in my coyote shape, but I was a predator...\n\nMechanic Mercy Thompson can shift her shape - but not her loyalty. When her former boss and mentor is arrested for murder and left to rot behind bars by his own kind, it's up to Mercy to clear his name, whether he wants her to or not.\n\nMercy's loyalty is under pressure from other directions, too. Werewolves are not known for their patience, and if Mercy can't decide between the two she cares for, Sam and Adam may make the choice for her...\n\n\n04. Bone Crossed (Mercy Thompson, #4) - Patricia Briggs\n\nBy day, Mercy is a car mechanic in the sprawling Tri-Cities of Eastern Washington. By night, she explores her preternatural side. As a shapeshifter with some unique talents, Mercy has often found herself having to maintain a tenuous harmony between the human and the not so human. This time she may get more than she bargained for.\n\nMarsilia, the local Vampire Queen, has learned that Mercy crossed her by slaying a member of her clanÃ¢â‚¬â€and she's out for blood. But since Mercy is protected from direct reprisal by the werewolf pack (and her close relationship with its sexy Alpha), it won't be Mercy's blood Marsilia is after.\n\n\n05. Silver Borne (Mercy Thompson, #5) - Patricia Briggs\n\nBeing a mechanic is hard work. Mercy Thompson, for instance, just spent the last couple of months trying to evade the murderous queen of the local vampire seethe. And now the leader of the werewolf pack, who's maybe-more-than-just-a-friend, has asked for her help. A book of fae secrets has come to light and they're all about to find out how implacable - and dangerous - the fae can be.\n\nOK, so maybe her troubles have nothing to do with the job. But she sure could use a holiday...\n\n\n06. River Marked (Mercy Thompson, #6) - Patricia Briggs\n\nMercy Thompson is a shapeshifter, a talent she inherited from her long-gone father. And she's never known any others of her kind. Until now. As Mercy comes to terms with this new information, an evil is stirring in the depths of the Columbia River. Something deadly is coming, facts are thin on the ground and Mercy feels ill at ease.\n\n\n07. Frost Burned (Mercy Thompson, #7) - Patricia Briggs\n\nMercy Thompson's life has undergone a seismic change. Becoming the mate of Adam Hauptman - the charismatic Alpha of the local werewolf pack - has made her a stepmother to his daughter Jesse, a relationship that brings moments of blissful normalcy to Mercy's life. But on the edges of humanity, a minor mishap on an ordinary day can turn into so much more. After an accident in bumper-to-bumper traffic, Mercy and Jesse can't reach Adam - or anyone else in the pack for that matter. They've all been abducted. Through their mating bond, all Mercy knows is that Adam is angry and in pain. Outclassed and on her own, Mercy may be forced to seek assistance from the most unlikely of allies: the vampire seethe.\n\n\n08. Night Broken (Mercy Thompson, #8) - Patricia Briggs\n\nAn unexpected phone call heralds a new challenge for Mercy. Her mate AdamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ex-wife is in trouble, on the run from a stalker. Adam isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the kind of man to turn away a person in needÃ¢â‚¬â€and Mercy knows it. But with Christy holed up in AdamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s house, Mercy canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t shake the feeling that something about the situation isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t right.\n\nSoon, her suspicions are confirmed when she learns that Christy has the farthest thing from good intentions. She wants Adam back and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s willing to do whatever it takes to make it happen, including turning AdamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pack against Mercy.\n\nMercy isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t about to step down without a fight, but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a more dangerous threat circling. ChristyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stalker is more than a bad manÃ¢â‚¬â€in fact, he may not be human at all. As the bodies start piling up, Mercy must put her personal troubles aside to face a creature with the power to tear her whole world apart","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f4ff9a9d5dc822b900fb58d19e673ce4502863c","amp;dn":"Mercy+Thompson+Series+-+Patricia+Briggs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f4ff9a9d5dc822b900fb58d19e673ce4502863c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,79,249,169,213,220,130,43,144,15,181,141,25,230,115,206,69,2,134,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
