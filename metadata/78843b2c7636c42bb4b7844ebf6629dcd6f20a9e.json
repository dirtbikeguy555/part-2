Additional brush features include a 'healing' brush for seam removal and duplication of texture detail and a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœslurp' brush for smearing and dragging texture. \nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s possible to simulate a vast range of reflective surfaces using MARIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s advanced spherical environment mapping. All painting and shading tools are available in 3D projection paint mode and 'flat' UV paint mode, while tiled textures with masking make it simple to quickly cover large areas on models. A UV-less workflow (PTEX) lets you adjust texture size on a per-face level, allowing for near-limitless detail.\nMARI gives you masked filters for colour correction, noise and masked blend constant color, with the added bonus of being able to preview all filters in real-time. An advanced channel masking engine supports mask painting and surface falloff and enables masking one channel to another\n\nAdvanced layering\n\nThe full power of a layer-based workflow along with adjustments, procedurals and advanced masking means that you can paint faster and with greater control than ever before with MARI. Procedural layers make it easy to create the look you want, seamlessly blending procedural and painted detail with the same toolkit. A powerful procedural engine is built into the heart of the layer stack, offering fluid, GPU-accelerated real-time procedural noises, patterns, projections and more.\n\nRealistic interactive preview\n\nWith MARI, you can create normal maps on the fly from bump maps, making it simpler and easier to generate and manipulate textures. Shadow support lets you cast real-time shadows on objects from multiple light sources and provides a customisable real-time 3D shader preview for things like specular highlights, displacement preview via bump mapping and colour correction. MARI also allows you to import multiple camera moves through which to view your model.\n\nGeometry handling\n\nMARI handles animated geometry and animated textures with ease, making it possible to isolate, select, mask and hide geometry per patch and face. Being able to have overlapping UVs means you can re-use the same texture across 3D models in any shared UV space, as well as handling multiple objects, versions and instances, with or without baked animation.\nHandling very large 3D model data sets becomes simple with MARIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to scale to over 1 million polygons for a single topology or mesh. MARI can also support large textures of up to 32K x 32K pixels and thousands of textures per model across different channels, allowing for almost infinite amounts of detail.\n\nColor management\n\nWith OpenColorIO (OCIO), the open source color management solution from Sony Picture Imageworks, you can handle color transforms and image display across multiple applications by setting up a single profile to provide consistent colors across the board. A key tool in simplifying the color management process, OCIO is suitable for both visual effects work and animated features and is specifically geared towards post-production work.\n\nSystem requirements\n\n- Operating system : Windows 7 64-bit\n\nMinimum hardware requirements\n-Quad-core processor\n-250GB disk space available for caching and temporary files (or a minimum of 50GB if you're working on a small project)\n-At least 4GB RAM\n-Display with 1680 x 1050 pixel resolution\n-An NVIDIA or AMD graphics card with at least 1GB of RAM and OpenGL 3.2 Support (see Ã¢â‚¬ËœTested graphics cardsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ below) Please note that you need Mac OSX 10.9 or higher to run Mari on Mac with AMD cards.\n\n*Displacement preview is currently only available on the cards and drivers that support OpenGL 4.0 or newer.\n\nTested graphics cards for Windows\n-NVIDIA GeForce GTX 480\n-NVIDIA GeForce GTX 580\n-NVIDIA GeForce GTX 680\n-NVIDIA Quadro (Fermi Series) 4000\n-NVIDIA Quadro (Fermi Series) 5000\n-NVIDIA Quadro (Fermi Series) 6000\n-NVIDIA Quadro K2000\n-NVIDIA Quadro K4000\n-NVIDIA Quadro K5000\n-AMD FirePro W7000\n-AMD FirePro W8000\n-AMD FirePro W9000\n-AMD Radeon HD 7850\n-AMD Radeon HD 7950\n\n*Please download and install the latest graphics driver for your card from the NVIDIA or AMD websites.
