Rock, the author of Quiet Leadership and Personal Best, shows how itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s possible for this couple, and thus the reader, not only to survive in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s overwhelming work environment but succeed in itÃ¢â‚¬â€and still feel energized and accomplished at the end of the day.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e29ee75a358b4f05c3f9f1d06c88c21c54b0fce6","amp;dn":"Your+Brain+at+Work+by+David+Rock.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e29ee75a358b4f05c3f9f1d06c88c21c54b0fce6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,158,231,90,53,139,79,5,195,249,241,208,108,136,194,28,84,176,252,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
