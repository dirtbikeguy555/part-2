At the beginning the album bewitches with its lightness and simplicity, yet further itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s getting clear that thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nothing more than that. You canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t count on breathtaking melodies, thought-provoking lyrics or at least, impressive arrangements. Well, yes, I know itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pop music, but even such music can be really interesting and deep. Here we deal with plain stories of everyday life wrapped in a bit monotonous music that makes you get bored almost after listening to the first half of the album or even earlier. Of course, the songs have their moments, mostly thanks to the vocals pleasant to the ear, however the voice gradually lulls although such tracks as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Little NumbersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Oh BoyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“SkinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Silver StreetsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ will wake you up from time to time in order to immerse into a tranquil drowse again. In general I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want to say, that the release is all bad, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s just for those who enjoy such kind of music and donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t demand too much. \n\n\nTracklist\n\n01.
