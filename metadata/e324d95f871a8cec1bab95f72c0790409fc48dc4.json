The book covers neuroanatomy, history taking and examination and then proceeds to discuss the clinical features of common problems as well as selected, less common neurological disorders, in a way that will demystify a part of medicine that many find complex and difficult to understand. The book is accompanied by a DVD explaining concepts, demonstrating techniques of performing the neurological examination and demonstration of abnormal neurological signs.\n\nThe first chapter is devoted to neuroanatomy from a clinical viewpoint. The concept of localising problems by likening the nervous system to a map grid with vertical meridians of longitude (the ascending sensory pathways and the descending motor pathway)and horizontal parallels of latitude (cortical signs, brainstem cranial nerves, nerve roots and peripheral nerves) of the nervous system is developed. Subsequent chapters take the reader through the neurological examination and the common neurological presentations from a symptom oriented approach. Chapter 4 contains a very simple method of understanding the brainstem, the &quot;rule of 4&quot;. Chapter 6 discusses the approach after the history and examination are completed. The final chapter is an overview of how to approach information gathering and keeping up-to-date using the complex information streams available.\n\nReviews of Clinical Neurology -\n\n&quot;I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who's looking for a book to introduce them to the field of neurology, and to anyone thats needs a quick refresher on neurological presentations. I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, gained plenty of new information, and have developed new ways of accessing neurological presentations.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Review by Kane Guthrie Google Preview\n\n&quot;.we may be seeing the birth of a new classic educational and training neurology textbook. I recommend it highly.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Review by Neil Scolding, Burden Professor of Clinical Neurosciences - practical-neurology.com\n\n&quot;Dr Gates has somehow deconstructed what a neurologist does and laid this bare for us to see. The result is a text of enormous utility to medical students, postgraduate students and importantly teachers of those studentsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Review by M.
