By the end of the course, the student will have enough knowledge to set up a network environment that has multiple subnets over multiple virtual LANs (VLANs), use network address translation (NAT) to connect to the Internet, and hand out IP addresses automatically. Additionally, the student will take a deep dive into IP addressing, using binary, to really gain a fundamental understanding of how endpoints are addressed. All you need as a prerequisite is a willingness to learn and basic computer skills.\nLesson 0: Getting Started with ICND1 (100-101)\nLesson 1: Introduction to Data Networking\nLesson 2: Introduction to Network Protocols\nLesson 3: Network Models\nLesson 4: The OSI Model and Encapsulation\nLesson 5: TCP and UDP\nLesson 6: Introduction to Binary\nLesson 7: Introduction to IP Addressing\nLesson 8: Router Basics\nLesson 9: Router Configuration\nLesson 10: SSH and CLI Tips\nLesson 11: Routing Packets\nLesson 12: Ethernet and Switching\nLesson 13: Switch Configuration\nLesson 14: Other Data Link Layer Protocols and the Physical Layer\nLesson 15: Introduction to Subnetting\nLesson 16: Subnetting Examples\nLesson 17: Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)\nLesson 18: Building the Routing Table\nLesson 19: Route Summarization\nLesson 20: Dynamic Routing\nLesson 21: Introduction to OSPF\nLesson 22: Virtual LANs (VLANs)\nLesson 23: VLAN Trunks\nLesson 24: Inter-VLAN Routing\nLesson 25: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)\nLesson 26: Static Network Address Translation (NAT)\nLesson 27: Dynamic Network Address Translation (NAT)\nLesson 28: Access Control Lists (ACLs)\nLesson 29: Extended Access Control Lists\nLesson 30: Switch Security: Native VLANs, DHCP Spoofing, and DTP\nLesson 31: Switch Security: Switchport Port-security\nLesson 32: Network Device Security\nLesson 33: IPv6\nLesson 34: Next Steps\n\nAbout the author:\nRoss has had a diverse career.
