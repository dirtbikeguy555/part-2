The series follows four women: Maggie (Christina Ricci), Kate (Kelli Garner), Colette (Karine Vanasse)and Laura (Margot Robbie), as they go to the luxury of Pan Am as Flight Attendants. With the glamor of the plans, the pilots are revered as rock stars and the stewardesses are desired by everyone. As the ladies are trained on everything related to flying, many characters come to show their support. Joining them is pilot Dean (Jonah Lotan) who is confident in his charisma and ambitions.\n\nCreated by Jack Orman (ER, JAG), &quot;Pan Am&quot; is an unique look into the past on one of the most famous airlines in history. With Tommy Schlamme (West Wing) on board as Director, the show shows the deep insight into what the world was like back then on board the most expensive luxurious planes.\n\n\n\nList of Episodes:\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=717146#pid717146&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=717146#pid717146&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFormat :\t\tXviD\nFile size:  \t\t350 MiB avg. per episode\nDuration : \t\t42 min avg. per episode\nWidth : \t\t624 pixels\nHeight : \t\t352 pixels\nAspect ratio :  \t16:9\nFrame rate :    \t23.976fps\nAudio:  \t\tMP3\nNr. of Files:\t\t14 + 1 trailer + 1 Teaser + 1 txt = 17\n\n\nAll files properly named, keeping the original file names intact.\nThis pack wouldn't have been possible without you, we worship you,\n\n+++eztv+++TvTeam+++VTV+++scenebalance+++TorrentDay+++eztv+++\nand the release groups\n+++2HD,ASAP,FQM,LOL,IMMERSE,FEVER,SYS,ORENJI,REWARD,SPASTiKUS,MiXED,MOMENTUM+++\nand all the others (too many to mention them all)\n\nAfter 24 hours initial seeding there should be enough seeders to get the whole thing with decent speed in a decent time.\n\n###################  You like your show in one pack?  ###################\n#########################  Here you go!  #########################\nVisit the KABLAM!!! @ forum.suprbay.org\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor questions,requests,comments feel free to PM me on SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWant to be kept in the loop?
