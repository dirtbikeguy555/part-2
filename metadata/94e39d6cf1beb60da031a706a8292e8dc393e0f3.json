It certainly runs circles around the default option in Windows. However, it's not the most convenient way to kick programs off of your hard drive. It tucks many of the best features behind a paywall, too.\n\nRevo Uninstaller comes with the free trial, which lacks some of the high-end features of the pro version. Though it can delete some registry errors that usually come with deleting programs, it doesn't remove all of them. To do that, you need to upgrade or use a different program. Upgrading doesn't add any speed to this download, which is something it's sorely missing. It makes you wait until one program is finished to start uninstalling another. It's even more annoying since you have to go through each individual program's built-in uninstall process, too. Choosing programs to uninstall is easy and fast, though, thanks to the program's icon-oriented menu. There are plenty of options to tweak your uninstalls. You can choose from options that include a light uninstall or a deep cleaning that rips all traces of the program off of your hard drive. There's even a really neat &quot;hunting&quot; mode that lets you uninstall programs or kill tasks without fully loading the program.\nRevo Uninstaller seems to be a very interesting mix of registry-cleaning and uninstall programs. Luckily, it does both of those actions well enough to earn a passing grade. If you really like the program, you might want to upgrade to the pro version. It's fairly priced and adds some essential features that aren't available in the free version.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94e39d6cf1beb60da031a706a8292e8dc393e0f3","amp;dn":"Revo+Uninstaller+Pro+3.0.8.x86.x64.Incl.Patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94e39d6cf1beb60da031a706a8292e8dc393e0f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,227,157,108,241,190,182,13,160,49,167,6,168,41,46,141,195,147,224,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
