Select the perfect pose. Execute. That's Roberto Valenzuela's method, and that's what he'll be teaching at creativeLIVE! With Roberto's practical, repeatable method you can make the most out of any location by identifying the elements you can use to enhance your image and the distracting elements you want to minimize and avoid. His posing process takes the guesswork outÃ¢â‚¬â€start with the spine and arrange each body part until you've got what you want.\nAnd that's the best partÃ¢â‚¬â€Roberto may be an international award-winning photographer, but he won't make us shoot in his style. He's not telling us what choices to make: he's teaching us what questions to ask to take the best possible pictures in our OWN style.\n\nInstructor: Roberto Valenzuela\n\nSchool: Photography\n\nDate: 3 Day Workshop\n\nMore info: http://www.creativelive.com/courses/location-posing-execution-roberto-valenzuela\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2634cf0be09bea6757529dac7675bbef2f90fbda","amp;dn":"CreativeLive+-+Location%2C+Posing%2C+Execution+with+Roberto+Valenzue","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2634cf0be09bea6757529dac7675bbef2f90fbda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,52,207,11,224,155,234,103,87,82,157,172,118,117,187,239,47,144,251,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
