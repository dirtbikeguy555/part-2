Musically, the album's ten tracks vacillate between economy and experimentation, hybrid and pop classicism, while consistently manifesting Beck and Danger Mouse's shared interest in psych-rock, folk, electronic minimalism and orchestration.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4aea342c930f5221bcaf52b21f76b6d3245e6727","amp;dn":"Beck+-+Modern+Guilt+%5Bmp3-320-2008%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4aea342c930f5221bcaf52b21f76b6d3245e6727","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,234,52,44,147,15,82,33,188,175,82,178,31,118,182,211,36,94,103,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
