He was known for breaking with existing literary forms, developing a new sort of semi-autobiographical novel that blended character study, social criticism, philosophical reflection, surrealist free association and mysticism, always distinctly about and expressive of the real-life Henry Miller and yet also fictional. His most characteristic works of this kind are Tropic of Cancer (1934), Black Spring (1936), Tropic of Capricorn (1939) and The Rosy Crucifixion trilogy (1949-59), all of which were banned in the United States until 1964. He also wrote travel memoirs and literary criticism, and painted watercolors.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b747bb353e2bcde610b10b0fa01899086bb3e223","amp;dn":"Henry+Miller+Books","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b747bb353e2bcde610b10b0fa01899086bb3e223","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,71,187,53,62,43,205,230,16,177,11,15,160,24,153,8,107,179,226,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
