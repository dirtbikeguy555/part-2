In conceiving this record, the creative team walked a very fine line by deciding on a project that could both stand among its contemporary peers and yet sound classic. \r\nIt is hard in modern salsa to find the tres, a sultry bolero, or to hear plena played well. In a genre that continues to narrow its stylistic scope, it's refreshing to come across a record that can simultaneously be a citizen of the present, and reach to the past. Cruz herself delivers that gutsy, dark molasses tone that is as sweet as the &quot;Azucarrr!&quot; she made famous. \r\nLike Celia, Siempre Vivire is of such a high quality that is both a bold challenge for tomorrow and a graceful bow to yesterday.
