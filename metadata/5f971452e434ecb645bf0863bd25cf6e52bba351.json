Allegedly, this album Ã¢â‚¬â€ discovered by Legacy and John Carter Cash during some archival work in 2012 Ã¢â‚¬â€ was shelved because its Billy Sherrill production was just a little bit too pop for Johnny CashÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs taste, but that reasoning isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sound, particularly with the Chips Moman-produced crossover of sugar of Rainbow taken into consideration. Moman had been riding high on the hits he produced for Willie Nelson Ã¢â‚¬â€ notably Ã¢â‚¬Å“Always on My Mind,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ WillieÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs last great crossover smash Ã¢â‚¬â€ and he applied a similar heavy-handed touch to Cash, who at that point was several years away from his last Country Top 10 hit (Ã¢â‚¬Å“The BaronÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ went to 10 in 1981). Sherrill had a lighter touch with Cash than Moman, something that might surprise listeners who associate his name with his symphonic, string-heavy productions for George Jones, but the producer winds up simply sweetening Johnny without changing his core sound. Comprised of sessions from 1981 and 1984, Out Among the Stars is generally chipper and bright, containing a couple of spare, reflective moments Ã¢â‚¬â€ the sentimental Ã¢â‚¬Å“After All,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the June Carter Cash bluegrass duet Ã¢â‚¬Å“DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t You Think ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Come Our Time,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Came to Believe,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the gospel-ish closer that ambles along nicely Ã¢â‚¬â€ that add a little dimension to a cheerful album. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Out Among the StarsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ nicely updates the signature Cash train-track rhythm, a cover of the Dave Edmunds/Carlene Carter duet Ã¢â‚¬Å“Baby Ride EasyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ rolls along with spirit, Cash yucks it up with Waylon Jennings on a cover of the Hank Snow standard Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m MovinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ On,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Drove Her Out of My MindÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ conjures some of the old outlaw magic. Every one of these seem like they could have some kind of potential on the charts, so the fact they were shelved is a bit of a mystery because, when taken together Ã¢â‚¬â€ despite misguided novelties like Ã¢â‚¬Å“If I Told You Who It WasÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ it adds up to one of CashÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs stronger Ã¢â‚¬â„¢80s albums. 1.
