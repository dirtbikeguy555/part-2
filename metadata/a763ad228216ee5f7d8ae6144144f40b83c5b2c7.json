For three decades now Jonathan Richman has enjoyed cult status amongst the lonely, misunderstood, sentimental and sad romantics amongst us! A hack from the NME recently spoke of his &quot;service to frustrated boys everywhere&quot;. Yes, I can subscribe to that. There&amp;#039;s no harm in admitting that in the company of Jonathan Richman&amp;#039;s music. This is not the world of the manic depressive student bed-sit wastelands inhabited by Smiths fans in the 1980&amp;#039;s. \nHis anti-rock stance and lo-fi attitude has made him an unlikely punk hero. Revered in music by the Rockingbirds in their glowing tribute &amp;#039;Jonathan Jonathan&amp;#039; and paid homage by the BMX Bandits in their version of Jonathan&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;That Summer Feeling&amp;#039;.\n\n\n01.
