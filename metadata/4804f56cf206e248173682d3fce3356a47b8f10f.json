And these costs will continue to rise. So how can the average homeowner lower their energy bill and still maintain a comfortable, healthy, and green house? The answer is: Bruce Harley's Cut Your Energy Bills Now. Offering eye-opening incentives and easily achievable methods, Harley's uncluttered and organized approach will not only benefit the environment, it will help anyone reduce their heating, cooling, and electrical expenses. Highlighted by numbered tips and techniques for easy reference, the book presents a treasure trove of simple and inexpensive ways for cutting energy costs by up to 20% -- and even 40% in some cases.\n\n=============\n\nGreen Your Home - All-in-one for Dummies\nJohn Wiley &amp; Sons \nby Yvonne Jeffery, Liz Barclay , Michael Grosvenor, Elizabeth B.
