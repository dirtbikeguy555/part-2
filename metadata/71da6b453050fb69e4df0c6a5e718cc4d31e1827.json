For apples in the fall there's apple butter; snapper ceviche with apple and lime; and pork tenderloin and roasted apple. In the summer, Hugh explores uses for berries, offering recipes for blackberry vinegar, pickled blueberries, and raspberry cobbler with drop biscuits. Beautifully written, this book brings fresh produce to the center of your plate. It's what both your doctor and your grocery bill have been telling you to do, and Hugh gives us the knowledge and the inspiration to wrap ourselves around produce in new ways.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ultraimg.com/images/0034d222.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ultraimg.com/images/0034d222.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71da6b453050fb69e4df0c6a5e718cc4d31e1827","amp;dn":"The+Broad+Fork%3A+Recipes+for+the+Wide+World+%282015%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71da6b453050fb69e4df0c6a5e718cc4d31e1827","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,218,107,69,48,80,251,105,228,223,12,106,94,113,140,196,211,30,24,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
