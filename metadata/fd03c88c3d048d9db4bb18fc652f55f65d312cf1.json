With the help of piccure+, your equipment can now be upgraded with a mouse click. It is equally useful for users of expensive fast lenses as well as more economic zoom lenses. You will often be able to match the sharpness of lenses costing several thousands of dollars with equipment costing a fraction of that amount, and finally get â€œthe crispâ€ touch with your prime lens wide open. No other solution gives your equipment a similar upgrade. \r\n\r\n- Piccure+ complements your existing toolset\r\n- With piccure+ you can benefit from the ignorance of an entire industry.\r\n- Donâ€™t let physics ruin your image composition\r\n- Correct optical flaws\r\n- Correct camera shake\r\n- Developed for professionals\r\n- Easy to use, different and yet powerful\r\n\r\nWhat's New in piccure+ v2.5:\r\n- piccure+ is now compatible with Adobe Photoshop/Lightroom CC 2015.\r\n- Faster image processing (30-70% decrease in computation time)\r\n- Chromatic aberrations are not automatically corrected for &quot;Strong&quot; aberrations any longer\r\n- Faster RAW Thumbnail generation (90% decrease in Thumbnail generation)\r\n- Integrates as external application into several imaging programs (e.g. DxO Optics Pro and Capture One Pro)\r\n- Additional cameras are supported (RAW)\r\n\r\nStand Alone &amp; Plug-in: AdobeÂ® Photoshop Â® CS4 or later, Adobe Lightroom Â® version 3 or later\r\nAdobe PhotoshopÂ® Elements version 7 or later","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd03c88c3d048d9db4bb18fc652f55f65d312cf1","amp;dn":"Piccure+Plus+2.5.0.69+For+Adobe+Photoshop%2FLightroom+%5BSadeemPC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd03c88c3d048d9db4bb18fc652f55f65d312cf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,3,200,140,61,4,141,157,180,187,24,252,101,47,85,246,93,49,44,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
