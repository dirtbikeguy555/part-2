Winters\r\n\r\n Now Detective Hank Palace returns in Countdown City, the second volume of the Last Policeman trilogy. There are just 77 days before a deadly asteroid collides with Earth, and Detective Palace is out of a job. With the Concord police force operating under the auspices of the U.S. Justice Department, Hank's days of solving crimes are over...until a woman from his past begs for help finding her missing husband.\r\n\r\nBrett Cavatone disappeared without a trace--an easy feat in a world with no phones, no cars, and no way to tell whether someone's gone &quot;bucket list&quot; or just gone. With society falling to shambles, Hank pieces together what few clues he can, on a search that leads him from a college-campus-turned-anarchist-encampment to a crumbling coastal landscape where anti-immigrant militia fend off &quot;impact zone&quot; refugees","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83cf1c5e57d1bd00868faf2d2cf57d235cbc82b7","amp;dn":"Ben+H.+Winters-Countdown+City+%5BEpub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83cf1c5e57d1bd00868faf2d2cf57d235cbc82b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,207,28,94,87,209,189,0,134,143,175,45,44,245,125,35,92,188,130,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
