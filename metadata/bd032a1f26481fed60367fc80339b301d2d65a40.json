However, this basic simplicity combined with its multilayer architecture turns it into an easy-to-use but extremely powerful instrument that can be programmed and tweaked quickly, almost effortlessly leveraging its maximum potential.\n\n\nThe multilayer architecture guarantees that both the sound design possibilities and number of unique situations in which LuSH-101 can be used are virtually limitless. Layered sounds can be created simply by assigning the layers to the same MIDI channel; the results can sound as massive as anything imaginable! Assigning the layers to different keyboard zones allows you to create even the most sophisticated splits. Of course, you can always assign the various layers to different MIDI channels for 8-part multitimbral usage. And, virtually any combination of splits, layers, and multitimbrality is possible with just a single instance of LuSH. With each layer working as an independent synthesizer with its own polyphony, parameters, enhanced arpeggiator, and a palette of only the finest insert effects, LuSH-101 can push your creativity to unprecedented levels!\n\n\nWant to express yourself even more? In addition to a very sophisticated MIDI-learn implementation, an advanced modulation matrix is built into each layer. Even the Arpeggiator's MIDI output can be used as a modulation source, unleashing your creativity to build complex sequences and progressions.\n\n\nLuSH also comes complete with a powerful built in mixer, complete with layer-independent parametric equalizers and compressors. Three send effects in superb quality allow you to put the finishing touches on the final output.\n\n\nLuSH plays perfectly in any genre. For funkier styles, the Gate may be used instead of the VCA for instant staccato sounds full of energy and rhythmic pep. When creating Ambient or Chillout, longer attack and release times along with the smooth, rich spaciousness of the built-in reverb are enough to satisfy even the most ardent purists. Is Dubstep or Drum &amp; Bass more your thing? No problem! Filters modulated by the LFOs and envelopes in conjunction with Unison mode can lead to the sickest, nastiest, and most novel vibrationsÃ¢â‚¬â€your sound system won't know what hit it (and you won't, either), so watch out! No matter what you want to play or how you want to use it, LuSH will get the job done.\n\n\n\nSound like never before\n\n\nLuSH-101Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s uniquely accurate sound has been achieved only through experience: countless hours have been spent analyzing classic analogue synthesizers, and then designing and implementing DSP algorithms with close attention paid to every component in the signal pathÃ¢â‚¬â€not just the approximating the overall output. We deliver to you a synthesizer built on oscillators of uncompromising quality, filters with incredible natural warmth and character, and effects each at the absolute top of their class.\n\n\nInnovative oscillator algorithms developed by D16 make LuSH-101 sound exactly like a sampled hardware analog synthÃ¢â‚¬â€but without the sampling! There is no aliasing in the oscillators, even at 22kHz from the noteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s base frequency. Vibrato and pitch bend do not affect the spectral quality of the oscillators, allowing LuSH-101 to sound completely authentic under all conditions.\n\n\nA problem present in many virtual analogue synths is that the harmonics of generated sound waves start to disappear well below (and up to) the Nyquist frequency, causing the them to sound dull and lacking in clarity and punch. LuSH-101 was designed from the ground up to avoid this, resulting in a very rich and clear sound, even from the simplest waveforms!\n\n\nResonance is constant across the entire frequency domain, which makes the filter sound totally authentic, especially when controlled via the envelopes or an LFO. Turning resonance to maximum and turning all the oscillators down will produce a pure and pleasant sine wave as the filter is driven into self-oscillation, exactly as with true analog gear. Of course, keyboard tracking can also be applied to the filter for a smooth, adjustable cutoff gradient across the keyboard range.\n\n\n\n\nFull Features\n\nMulti-core support for computers equipped with multi-core processors for better performance.\nMultilayer architecture with 8 independent Layers (per-layer properties)\nUp to 32 voices of polyphony\nMIDI channel\nKeyboard zone\nAudio output\nSynthesis\nOscillators (Saw, PWM, Noise), with Supersaw and HardSync options\nSub Oscillator (5 waveforms)\nSelf-oscillating, high-quality, multimode filter\nPassive high-pass filter\nUp to 8 voice unison with Tune, Cutoff and Panorama spread\n2 LFOs with optional tempo synchronization and re-triggering modes (Trig, Gate, Arpe, None)\n2 envelopes with re-triggering modes (Trig, Gate, LFO1, LFO2)\nInsert effect (selectable algorithms):\nChorus\nString Ensemble\nPhaser\nFlanger\nDistortion\nVowel filter\nDecimator\nTremolo\nModulation Matrix (modulation sources):\nNote velocity\nPitch bend\nModulation wheel\nExpression pedal\nSustain pedal\nKeyboardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s aftertouch\nNote pitch\nArpeggiatorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s output\nArpeggiator\nStep sequencer (Gate and Tie per step)\n6 Run modes (Up, Down, Up and Down, Down and Up, Random, Manual)\nChord mode (Gater)\n3 Hold modes (Normal, Toggle, Trigger)\nShuffle\nTempo multiplier (Full notes, Dotted notes, Triplets)\nMixer\nParametric EQs (1 per channel strip)\nCompressors (1 per channel strip)\nUp to 11 freely-assignable stereo output busses per instance\nSend FXÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s (Reverb, Chorus, Delay with tempo sync)\nPresets\nOver 1600 factory presets\n5 preset categories (whole synth, single layer, Arpeggiator, Reverb, Delay)\nAdvanced, file-based preset browser\nMiscellaneous\nAdvanced MIDI learn\nParameter mapping for VST / AU automation\nSelectable GUI size\n\n\n\nSystem requirements\n\nOS: Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7\nCPU: 2.8 Ghz with SSE (i7 based 3.7 GHz recommended)\nRAM: 1 GB (1.5 GB recommended)\nSoftware: VST compatible host application (32bit or 64bit)\nIt's not a standalone program so you need a host application to use it.\n\n\n\n\n\nINSTALLATION\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ You need WinRAR to extract the rar's files.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Uninstall previous versions.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Install.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Use the keygen to generate a keyfile,\nor pre generated keyfile\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Register with the keyfile.\n\n\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ That's it!
