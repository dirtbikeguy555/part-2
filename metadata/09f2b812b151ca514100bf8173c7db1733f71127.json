Just when sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about to be reunited with PercyÃ¢â‚¬â€after six months of being apart, thanks to HeraÃ¢â‚¬â€it looks like Camp Jupiter is preparing for war. As Annabeth and her friends Jason, Piper, and Leo fly in on the Argo II, she canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t blame the Roman demigods for thinking the ship is a Greek weapon. With its steaming bronze dragon masthead, LeoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fantastical creation doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t appear friendly. Annabeth hopes that the sight of their praetor Jason on deck will reassure the Romans that the visitors from Camp Half-Blood are coming in peace.\n\nAnd thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only one of her worries. In her pocket Annabeth carries a gift from her mother that came with an unnerving demand: Follow the Mark of Athena. Avenge me. Annabeth already feels weighed down by the prophecy that will send seven demigods on a quest to findÃ¢â‚¬â€and closeÃ¢â‚¬â€ the Doors of Death. What more does Athena want from her?\n\nAnnabethÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s biggest fear, though, is that Percy might have changed. What if heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s now attached to Roman ways? Does he still need his old friends? As the daughter of the goddess of war and wisdom, Annabeth knows she was born to be a leader, but never again does she want to be without Seaweed Brain by her side.\n\nNarrated by four different demigods, The Mark of Athena is an unforgettable journey across land and sea to Rome, where important discoveries, surprising sacrifices, and unspeakable horrors await. Climb aboard the Argo II, if you dare. . . .\n\nIn The Son of Neptune, Percy, Hazel, and Frank met in Camp Jupiter, the Roman equivalent of Camp Halfblood, and traveled to the land beyond the gods to complete a dangerous quest. The third book in the Heroes of Olympus series will unite them with Jason, Piper, and Leo. But they number only six--who will complete the Prophecy of Seven?\n\n\nThe Greek and Roman demigods will have to cooperate in order to defeat the giants released by the Earth Mother, Gaea. Then they will have to sail together to the ancient land to find the Doors of Death. What exactly are the Doors of Death? Much of the prophesy remains a mystery. . . . With old friends and new friends joining forces, a marvelous ship, fearsome foes, and an exotic setting, The Mark of Athena promises to be another unforgettable adventure by master storyteller Rick Riordan.\n\n\n                            Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                            Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n\n          **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n             Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                 &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09f2b812b151ca514100bf8173c7db1733f71127","amp;dn":"The+Mark+of+Athena+by+Rick+Riordan+%28Heroes+of+Olympus+3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09f2b812b151ca514100bf8173c7db1733f71127","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,242,184,18,177,81,202,81,65,0,191,129,115,199,219,23,51,247,17,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
