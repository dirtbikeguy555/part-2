The Human Galactic Alliance has been\nconstantly fighting for its survival against a grotesque race of beings called Hideous. During an intense battle,\nthe young lieutenant Ledo and his humanoid mobile weapon Chamber are swallowed up into a distortion of time and space.\n\nWaking from his artificially induced hybernation, Ledo realises that he has arrived on Earth, the planet on the lost frontier.\nOn this planet that was completely flooded by the seas, people live in fleets of giant ships,\nsalvaging relics from the seas' depths in order to survive.\n\nLedo arrives on one of the fleets called Gargantia. With no knowledge of the planet's history or culture,\nhe is forced to live alongside Amy, a 15-year-old girl who serves as a messenger aboard the Gargantia fleet.\nTo Ledo, who has lived a life where he knows nothing but fighting, these days of peace continue to surprise him.\n\nVIDEO\n- Video Source: BD-J\n- Video Codec: H.264/AVC\n- Video Resolution: 1280x720p HD (16:9)\n- Video FPS: 23.976\n\nAUDIO\n- Codec: AAC\n- Track 1: English: Stereo\n- Track 2: Japanese: Stereo\n\nSUBTITLES\n- Track 1: English Signs/Songs\n- Track 1: English Subtitles\n\n[CBM] Gargantia on the Verdurous Planet 1-13+SP Complete (Dual Audio) [BDRip-720p-8bit]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cb87b3839f8ecca44635eb25bcceaad82b60636","amp;dn":"%5BCBM%5D+Gargantia+on+the+Verdurous+Planet+1-13%2BSP+Complete+%28Dual+A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cb87b3839f8ecca44635eb25bcceaad82b60636","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,184,123,56,57,248,236,202,68,99,94,178,91,204,234,173,130,182,6,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
