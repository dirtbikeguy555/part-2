Half of all species could disappear by the end of the century, and scientists now concede that most of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s endangered animals will survive only if conservationists keep rigging the world around them in their favor. So Mooallem ventures into the field, often taking his daughter with him, to move beyond childlike fascination and make those creatures feel more real. Wild Ones is a tour through our environmental moment and the eccentric cultural history of people and wild animals in America that inflects itÃ¢â‚¬â€from Thomas JeffersonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s celebrations of early abundance to the turn-of the-last-century origins of the teddy bear to the whale-loving hippies of the 1970s. In America, Wild Ones discovers, wildlife has always inhabited the terrain of our imagination as much as the actual land.\n\nThe journey is framed by the stories of three modern-day endangered species: the polar bear, victimized by climate change and ogled by tourists outside a remote northern town; the little-known LangeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s metalmark butterfly, foundering on a shred of industrialized land near San Francisco; and the whooping crane as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s led on a months-long migration by costumed men in ultralight airplanes. The wilderness that Wild Ones navigates is a scrappy, disorderly place where amateur conservationists do grueling, sometimes preposterous-looking work; where a marketer maneuvers to control the polar bearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s image while Martha Stewart turns up to film those beasts for her show on the Hallmark Channel. Our most comforting ideas about nature unravel. In their place, Mooallem forges a new and affirming vision of the human animal and the wild ones as kindred creatures on an imperfect planet.\n\nWith propulsive curiosity and searing wit, and without the easy moralizing and nature worship of environmental journalismÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s older guard, Wild Ones merges reportage, science, and history into a humane and endearing meditation on what it means to live in, and bring a life into, a broken world.\n\n    ------------------\n    \n     What is here is an azw3 file you can put in a Kindle directory, or Convert using Calibre or Zamzar Online to other ebook formats.     \n   \n  #~# What is not here is the album based on the book: WILD ONES by Black Prairie.\n  (((Podcast Episode 91 of 99% Invisible is a performance half hour of said audio.\n\n\n     he   l i i               a  r         u       y  y u r  a      i    i      leh","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ab679fc20b17399e951d9574b6e281ff78d29cc","amp;dn":"Wild+Ones+.+Jon+Mooallem+.+ebook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ab679fc20b17399e951d9574b6e281ff78d29cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,182,121,252,32,177,115,153,233,81,217,87,75,110,40,31,247,141,41,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
