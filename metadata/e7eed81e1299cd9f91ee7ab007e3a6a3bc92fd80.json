He really does.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nAnd as well as being compassionate, Nhat Hanh is also a master of how to communicate practice. He reminds us to wash the dishes as if they were sacred relics ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a practice that helps bring a sense of care and aesthetic enjoyment into a mundane activity. He suggests over and over that we smile ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a practice that reminds us that happiness is a choice. He is also of course famous for the mindfulness bell ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a practice of stopping and paying attention to our present-moment experience.\n\nA world-renowned Zen master, Nhat Hanh weaves practical instruction with anecdotes and other stories to show how the meditative mind can be achieved at all times and how it can help us all ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œreveal and heal.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Nhat Hanh is a master at helping us find a calm refuge within ourselves and teaching us how to reach out from there to the rest of the world.\n\nThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nothing complicated in this book, but then thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nothing complicated about mindfulness. the difficult thing is to remember to do it, and Thich Nhat HanhÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s book is full of suggestions for reminding ourselves to be mindful.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7eed81e1299cd9f91ee7ab007e3a6a3bc92fd80","amp;dn":"The+Miracle+of+Mindfulness+by+Thich+Nhat+Hanh+%287Summits%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7eed81e1299cd9f91ee7ab007e3a6a3bc92fd80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,238,216,30,18,153,205,159,145,238,122,176,7,227,166,163,188,146,253,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
