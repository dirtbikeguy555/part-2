Most of his subsequent works explored similar themes.\n\nOne of his most famous novels is SNOW COUNTRY (1935-37), a stark tale of a love affair between a Tokyo dilettante and a provincial geisha, which takes place in a remote hot-spring town somewhere in the mountainous regions of northern Japan.  It established Kawabata as one of Japan's foremost authors and became an instant classic, described by Edward Seidensticker as &quot;perhaps Kawabata's masterpiece.&quot;\n\nTwo of his most important post-war works are THOUSAND CRANES and THE SOUND OF THE MOUNTAIN.  THOUSAND CRANES (1952) is a luminous story of desire, regret, and the almost sensual nostalgia that binds the living to the dead.  While attending a traditional tea ceremony in the aftermath of his parents' deaths, Kikuji encounters his father's former mistress and soon succumbs to passion -- a passion with tragic and unforeseen consequences.  Death, jealousy, and attraction convene around the delicate art of the tea ceremony, where every gesture is imbued with profound meaning.  Themes of implicit incest, impossible love and impending death are again explored in THE SOUND OF THE MOUNTAIN (1954), where the protagonist, an aging man, has grown disappointed of his children and has lost all passion for his wife.  He is strongly attracted to his daughter in law and his thoughts for her are interspersed with memories of another forbidden love, for his dead sister-in-law.\n\nKawabata considered his finest work to be THE MASTER OF GO (1951).  In this semi-fictional chronicle of a 1938 match played between a revered and heretofore invincible Master and a younger, more modern challenger, Kawabata captured the moment in which the immutable traditions of imperial Japan met the onslaught of the twentieth century.\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB/MOBI format unless otherwise noted:\n\n* BEAUTY AND SADNESS (Vintage, 1996).
