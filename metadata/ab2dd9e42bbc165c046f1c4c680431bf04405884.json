Join Edward Tanguay as he dives into PHP programming. In his workshop, you will learn that it only takes a few minutes to get an Apache web server, a MySQL database, PHP 5.3, and the Eclipse editor up and running using the free XAMPP installation tool. Edward will then cover the PHP syntax, such as operators, loops and variables, before moving on to make you a PHP expert, tackling object orientation, databases, XML parsing, web services, security and much more. The training also includes important new features of PHP 5.3, such as namespaces, lambdas, and late static binding. Once you complete this video training, you will have the skills you need to build next-generation dynamic websites.\n\nInfo: https://www.video2brain.com/en/courses/php-5-3\n\nPlease SEED after you download so I get free to upload the next release.
