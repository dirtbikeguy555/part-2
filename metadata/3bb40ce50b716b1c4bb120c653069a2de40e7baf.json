For the mobi file I tried out the links using Aldiko, Moon+Reader for the epub file and Kindle for mobi on a Samsung Note 10.1 (2012 model)\n\nFor users of Kindle for PC. Had a good look online. Many people made comments about not being able to enlarge pictures in Kindle for PC. The application mobipocket reader is  a good alternative. It is great for zooming in on pictures.\n\nFor Calibre you can right click on pictures and select View Image.\n\n\nEnjoy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bb40ce50b716b1c4bb120c653069a2de40e7baf","amp;dn":"Lonely+Planet+%26ndash%3B+Ireland+ebook+epub+mobi+Non-Fiction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bb40ce50b716b1c4bb120c653069a2de40e7baf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,180,12,229,11,113,107,28,75,177,32,198,83,6,154,45,228,14,123,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
