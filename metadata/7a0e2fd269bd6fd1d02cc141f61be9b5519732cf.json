Original band members included: Ron Keel on vocals and guitar, Michael Dunigan on lead guitar, Bobby Eva on drums and Tim Morrison on bass. In 1982, they released the single &quot;Cold Day in Hell&quot;.\r\n\r\nEva left the band after a short while and was replaced by drummer Mark Edwards. This line-up did not last long and released no albums or singles. The band was now based in east Los Angeles, CA, living and rehearsing in a large warehouse.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1983, 19-year-old Swedish guitar virtuoso Yngwie Malmsteen completed the new line-up, after Dunigan and Morrison left the band. Rik Fox was now on bass and this classic line-up released the band's first and only album, Steeler. It saw moderate commercial success and is now a sought after album for many fans of Malmsteen and Keel. Malmsteen left soon after the record's completion and joined Graham Bonnett to form Alcatrazz.\r\n     \r\nSteeler (Yngwie J.
