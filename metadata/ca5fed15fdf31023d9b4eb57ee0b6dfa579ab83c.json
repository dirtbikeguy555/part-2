But he was a man in transition: the Ã¢â‚¬â„¢80s saw him embracing mainstream pop on albums like August and Journeyman, and some quietly wondered if heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d ever revisit the blues tunes he so successfully introduced to the masses.\nThen in 1991, an unthinkable tragedy happened: ClaptonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s four-year-old son, Conor, fell from the window of a New York apartment and died. The heartbroken father laid his emotions bare on a new song, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tears in Heaven,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ first released on the soundtrack to the film Rush, was out barely a week when Clapton played it for Unplugged and the feeling was just as raw as the studio version.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Tears in HeavenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was one of many highlights of Unplugged, a set which saw Clapton tackle his old blues favorites (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Before You Accuse Me,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Alberta,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Malted MilkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) as well as a dramatic reworking of Derek &amp; The DominosÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ fiery Ã¢â‚¬Å“Layla.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Both Ã¢â‚¬Å“LaylaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tears in HeavenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ were Top 20 hits, and the album was a massive success, topping the Billboard charts, certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America for over 10 million copies shipped, and winner of six Grammy Awards, including Record of the Year, Album of the Year and Song of the Year.\n\nAn album this big deserves some classy treatment, and the expanded, triple-disc Unplugged looks like it delivers. In addition to the original album, a six-track bonus disc of rehearsal takes is included, featuring Ã¢â‚¬Å“Big MaceoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ MerriweatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Worried Life Blues,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and originals Ã¢â‚¬Å“CircusÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“My FatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Eyes,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ later released on 1998Ã¢â‚¬Â²s Pilgrim. A bonus DVD features both the original MTV Unplugged feature and 14 rehearsal tracks recorded in addition to the final set.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca5fed15fdf31023d9b4eb57ee0b6dfa579ab83c","amp;dn":"Eric+Clapton+-+Unplugged+%5BDeluxe+Edition%5D+2CD+%282013%29+MP3VBR+Beol","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca5fed15fdf31023d9b4eb57ee0b6dfa579ab83c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,95,237,21,253,243,16,35,217,180,235,87,238,11,109,250,87,154,184,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
