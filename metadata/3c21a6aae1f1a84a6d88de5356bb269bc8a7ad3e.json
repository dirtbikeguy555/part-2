I have never\nseen acting as fantastic as Tom Hardy plays his character Freddie. They could not have\nchosen a finer actor and he deserves so much credit for this series alone. I actually\ndid not see this on television, but I bought it on DVD, and as you can tell I do not\nregret my decision. I would highly recommend this to anyone and everyone. If you love\nBritish drama, then you will love this. It has everything from sheer grit to absolutely\nheart breaking consequences. You cannot watch this without feeling so many different\nemotions, whether it is tears of laughter or tears of sadness. It will by far be the\nbest 3 hours you will ever watch and it will definitely be something you will want to\nwatch again and again. Martina Cole's &quot;The Take&quot; is nothing short of sheer brilliance.\n\nUploader comment:\nOriginally a four part tv special for Sky One.\nWith an IMDB rating of 8.0 this needed to be edited into a full movie!\nTaken from the PAL Dvd release.\n\nDirector: David Drury\nWriters: Neil Biswas (screenplay)\nMartina Cole (novel)\nStars: Tom Hardy, Shaun Evans, Brian Cox, Kierston Wareing &amp; Charlotte Riley\nIMDB........   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1366321/combined&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1366321/combined&lt;/a&gt;\nWIKI........   &lt;a href=&quot; https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/The_Take_(TV_series)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/The_Take_(TV_series)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nVIDEO\n\nSize.... 1.36gb\n\nDuration.... 02:53:13\n\nCodec....
