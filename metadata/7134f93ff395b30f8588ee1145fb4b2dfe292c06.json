Dr. Judy Willis responds with an emphatic yes in this informative guide to getting better results in math class. Tapping into abundant research on how the brain works, Willis presents a practical approach for how we can improve academic results by demonstrating certain behaviors and teaching students in a way that minimizes negativity.\n\nWith a straightforward and accessible style, Willis shares the knowledge and experience she has gained through her dual careers as a math teacher and a neurologist. In addition to learning basic brain anatomy and function, readers will learn how to:\n\n * Improve deep-seated negative attitudes toward math. \n * Plan lessons with the goal of achievable challenge in mind. \n * Reduce mistake anxiety with techniques such as errorless math and estimation. \n * Teach to different individual learning strengths and skill levels. \n * Spark motivation. \n * Relate math to students personal interests and goals. \n * Support students in setting short-term and long-term goals. \n * Convince students that they can change their intelligence.\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7134f93ff395b30f8588ee1145fb4b2dfe292c06","amp;dn":"Learning+to+Love+Math%3A+Teaching+Strategies+That+Change+Student+A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7134f93ff395b30f8588ee1145fb4b2dfe292c06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,52,249,63,243,149,179,15,133,136,238,17,69,251,75,45,254,41,44,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
