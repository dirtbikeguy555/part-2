It was a great year for Hip-Hop!\n\nI put this list together to share great Hip-Hop and a lot of slept-on gems with the masses and to emphasize the fact that REAL Hip-Hop is very much alive. If most of these artists and songs are unknown to you, I highly recommend you give it a listen. You won't find many commercial Hip-Hop artists or songs that were on the radio on this list.\n\nI've attempted to highlight a number of different projects and artists, but more or less, it's a collection of my favorite Hip-Hop and Rap songs of 2011. It is, of course, very subjective. There was a tremendous amount of great music, and it was very difficult to narrow this down to 100 songs and near-impossible to order them. I had to leave off songs from a lot of very good projects and albums. I could have easily turned this into a Top 200 list! But I'm happy with it, and I hope you enjoy it.\n\nSongs are judged based on lyricism, production, concepts, overall sound and vibe, and a combination of all of those. The only rule I have when making the list: No more than 3 tracks from a single project. Other than that, it's just the best of the best.\n\nI've provided some insight into why certain songs were included throughout the list, as well as a more in-depth description for the Top 10 records of the year.\n\n#100.
