Initially episodes were based on the short stories collected in the books Tales of the Unexpected, Kiss Kiss and Someone Like You by Roald Dahl.\n\nThe stories were sometimes sinister, sometimes wryly comedic, and usually had a twist ending.\n\nThe theme music for the series was written by Ron Grainer.\n\nThe series originally adapted various stories from Dahl's anthology books. Despite the low budget the series attracted guest stars of the highest calibre, such as Brian Blessed, Anna Neagle, Timothy West, Rod Taylor, John Gielgud, Elaine Stritch, John Mills, Julie Harris, Wendy Hiller, Ian Holm, Joan Collins, Joseph Cotten, Derek Jacobi, Janet Leigh, Andrew Ray, SiobhÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n McKenna and Cyril Cusack.\n\nDahl introduced all of his own stories himself, giving short monologues explaining what inspired him to write the story.\n\nAlthough many of Dahl's stories are left open to reader's interperetation, the television series usually provided a conclusion to the story. For example, in the Dahl story &quot;The Landlady&quot;, the character of Billy's ultimate fate is only hinted at, whereas in the TV version we are shown that the Landlady in question really has poisoned and preserved the guests of her bed and breakfast, and Billy is to suffer the same fate.\n\nMidway through the second series, episodes ceased to be written by Dahl and other authors' stories were adapted for all episodes following. The title reflected this when it became Tales of the Unexpected - Introduced by Roald Dahl. From series three, Dahl no longer introduced the stories and the series continued this way until the end.\n\nBy 1988, critics felt that the quality of the series was starting to dip, and after the ninth series in 1988, the series was axed.\n\nIn the US, John Houseman succeeded Dahl as the opening narrator.\n\nIn 2006, ITV3 began repeating the series. Series 1 to 8 have been released on DVD.\n\nIn 1980, Peter Cook starred alongside a host of celebrities in the LWT special &quot;Peter Cook &amp; Co.&quot;. The show included many sketches including a Tales of the Unexpected spoof titled &quot;Tales Of The Much As We Expected&quot;, which involved Cook as Roald Dahl explaining why he dropped the &quot;n&quot; in Ronald, the sketch ends with the fireplace spreading over the room.\n\nDahl had hosted a practically identical series for the American CBS network called Way Out in 1961, which was similar in concept and themes to Twilight Zone for 14 episodes on Saturday nights and actually used some stories which would later be adapted for Tales of the Unexpected. Dahl later published series for many other TV shows that became his.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWell Known And Much Beloved Works by Roald Dahl\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChildren's novels\n\nThe Gremlins (1943) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· James and the Giant Peach (1961) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (1964) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· The Magic Finger (1966) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Fantastic Mr Fox (1970) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator (1972) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Danny, the Champion of the World (1975) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· The Enormous Crocodile (1978) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· The Twits (1980) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· George's Marvellous Medicine (1981) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· The BFG (1982) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· The Witches (1983) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· The Giraffe and the Pelly and Me (1985) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Matilda (1988) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Esio Trot (1989) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· The Minpins (1991) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· The Vicar of Nibbleswicke (1991)\n\n[b]Children's poetry [/b]\n\nRevolting Rhymes (1982) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Dirty Beasts (1983) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Rhyme Stew (1989)\n\nAdult novels\n\nSometime Never: A Fable for Supermen (1948) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· My Uncle Oswald (1979)\n\n\nAdult short story\n\ncollections\n\nOver to You: Ten Stories of Flyers and Flying (1946) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Someone Like You (1953) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Kiss Kiss (1960) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Switch Bitch (1974) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Six More (1977) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Tales of the Unexpected (1979) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· More Tales of the Unexpected (1980) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Two Fables (1986) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Roald Dahl: Collected Stories (2006)\n\nNon-fiction\n\nThe Mildenhall Treasure (1946) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Boy: Tales of Childhood (1984) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Going Solo (1986) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Memories with Food at Gipsy House (1991) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Roald Dahl's Guide to Railway Safety (1991) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· My Year (1993)\n\nFilm adaptations\n\nWilly Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory (1971) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Danny, the Champion of the World (1989) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· The BFG (1989) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· The Witches (1990) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· James and the Giant Peach (1996) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Matilda (1996) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)\n\nPlays\n\nThe Honeys (1955)\n\nFilm scripts\n\nYou Only Live Twice (1967) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· The Night Digger (1971) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory (1971)\n\nTelevision series\n\nWay Out (1961) Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Tales of the Unexpected (1979ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“88)\n\n\nTECHNICAL DETAILS - more or less the same for all episodes\n\nFormat : AVI\nFile size : 175 MiB\nDuration : 26mn\nOverall bit rate : 909 Kbps\n\nVideo\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual : XVID\nBit rate : 804 Kbps\nWidth : 512 pixels\nHeight : 384 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 4:3\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nCompression mode : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.164\nStream size : 154 MiB (88%)\nWriting library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio : MP3:Variable : 96.0 Kbps : 1 channel : 48.0 KHz : Lossy\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c424587d75a0f77d1e20356f34d783c5098f1e0d","amp;dn":"Tales+of+the+Unexpected++%28Complete+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c424587d75a0f77d1e20356f34d783c5098f1e0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,36,88,125,117,160,247,125,30,32,53,111,52,215,131,197,9,143,30,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
