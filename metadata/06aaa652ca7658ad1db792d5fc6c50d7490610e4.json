Along the way we will cover a range of techniques including: Offsetting layers to create interesting animations, using blend modes to build up interesting textures, animating text onto the screen effectively rather than using the unscalable Write-on tool, creating basic 3D made entirely in After Effects, and using the curves in the graph editor effectively to get silky smooth movement.\n\nBy the end of this tutorial, you will have learned how to use all these techniques and more to create an After Effects project without the use of any expensive, 3rd party plugins.\n\n\n1.
