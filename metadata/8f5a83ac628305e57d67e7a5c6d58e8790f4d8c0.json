It peaked at #1 on the Billboard 200, and became one of the band's biggest-selling albums in the United States, and has been certified by the RIAA as having six million copies sold as of 2000. It was a major critical success, with many reviewers calling it a classic return to form, and their best album since 1972's Exile on Main St.\n\nRe-release\n\nSome Girls was re-issued on 21 November 2011 as a 2 CD deluxe edition, including twelve songs recorded during the recording sessions for the album (with the exception of &quot;So Young&quot;). A Super-Deluxe edition also included a DVD with live footage &amp; promo videos, a 100-page book, 5 postcards, a poster, and a 7&quot; 180-gram replica vinyl single of &quot;Beast of Burden&quot;.[3] The backing tracks were recorded in Paris between October 1977 and March 1978 with mostly newly-recorded vocals by Mick Jagger, which were recorded sometime during 2010 and 2011. The album re-entered the charts at #58 in the UK and #46 in the US. [4] &quot;No Spare Parts&quot; was released as a single on 13 November, which went to No. 2 on Billboard's Hot Singles Sales. &quot;So Young&quot; was the second single from the Some Girls reissue, released briefly for free on iTunes the same day &quot;No Spare Parts&quot; was released. A video for &quot;No Spare Parts&quot; was produced and was later released on 19 December 2011.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\nDisc 1 - Remastered \n\n01. \t&quot;Miss You&quot;   \t4:48\n02. \t&quot;When the Whip Comes Down&quot;   \t4:20\n03. \t&quot;Imagination&quot; (Norman Whitfield/Barrett Strong) \t4:38\n04. \t&quot;Some Girls&quot;   \t4:36\n05. \t&quot;Lies&quot;   \t3:11\n06. \t&quot;Far Away Eyes&quot;   \t4:24\n07. \t&quot;Respectable&quot;   \t3:06\n08. \t&quot;Before They Make Me Run&quot;   \t3:25\n09. \t&quot;Beast of Burden&quot;   \t4:25\n10. \t&quot;Shattered&quot;   \t3:48\n   \nDisc 2 - 2011 Bonus \n\n01. \t&quot;Claudine&quot;   \t3:42\n02. \t&quot;So Young&quot;   \t3:18\n03. \t&quot;Do You Think I Really Care?&quot;   \t4:22\n04. \t&quot;When You're Gone&quot; (Jagger/Richards/Ronnie Wood) \t3:51\n05. \t&quot;No Spare Parts&quot;   \t4:30\n06. \t&quot;Don't Be a Stranger&quot;   \t4:06\n07. \t&quot;We Had It All&quot; (Troy Seals/Donnie Fritts) \t2:54\n08. \t&quot;Tallahassee Lassie&quot; (Crewe/Slay Jr./Picariello) \t2:37\n09. \t&quot;I Love You Too Much&quot;   \t3:10\n10. \t&quot;Keep Up Blues&quot;   \t4:20\n11. \t&quot;You Win Again&quot; (Hank Williams) \t3:00\n12. \t&quot;Petrol Blues&quot;   \t1:35","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f5a83ac628305e57d67e7a5c6d58e8790f4d8c0","amp;dn":"The+Rolling+Stones+-+Some+Girls+%5BDELUXE%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f5a83ac628305e57d67e7a5c6d58e8790f4d8c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,90,131,172,98,131,5,229,125,103,231,165,198,213,142,135,144,244,216,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
