The band enjoys a popularity level unheard of in reality, ranking as the seventh largest economy on Earth. They are so popular that impressionable fans will often do anything their songs tell them, even if it means death, which is usually the case. If Dethklok endorses a product or service, it quickly drives every competitor out of business. Part of the show's appeal is also high-quality metal music written by guitarist/creator Brendon Small and others, which is accredited to the band, and is featured in most episodes including actual guitar-fingerings and other band-movements of the characters.\nWIKI: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalocalypse\nIMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0839188/\n\nCreators: Brendon Small, Tommy Blacha.\nDirectors: Jon Schnepp, Chris Prynoski, Mark Brooks, Tommy Blacha.\nStarring: Tommy Blacha, Brendon Small, Mark Hamill, Victor Brandt, Malcolm McDowell, George Fisher, Laraine Newman, James Hetfield, Kim B.
