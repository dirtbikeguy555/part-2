Civilization IV: The Complete Edition includes the original strategy classic, plus the two expansion packs and the standalone game Colonization in one box, for one incredible value.\n\n\nIncludes all the expansion packs. No disk needed to play once installed. Not hacked/cracked just the install folder ripped from the actual DVD I bought. Copy Civ4 folder to location of your choice open it, double click setup.exe, install and play. I originally uploaded the complete ISO of the Disk but for some reason Civ III will not install properly so I just cut this Civ IV folder and am uploading it alone. Tested on Windows 7 64bit Home Edition on both a laptop and desktop and install and runs fine.\n\n                                               zGhost","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e58a92027cfd743231e6de1e1b48aa5d32619a56","amp;dn":"Civilization+IV+Complete+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e58a92027cfd743231e6de1e1b48aa5d32619a56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,138,146,2,124,253,116,50,49,230,222,30,27,72,170,93,50,97,154,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
