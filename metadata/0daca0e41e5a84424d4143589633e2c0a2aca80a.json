Learn what many candidates do wrong, and how to avoid these issues.\n* Steps to Prepare for Behavioral and Technical Questions: Stop meandering through an endless set of questions, while missing some of the most important preparation techniques. Follow these steps to more thoroughly prepare in less time.\n* Interview War Stories: A View from the Interviewer's Side: Humorous but instructive stories from our interviewers show you how some candidates really flopped on the most important question - and how you can avoid doing the same.\n\n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0daca0e41e5a84424d4143589633e2c0a2aca80a","amp;dn":"Cracking+the+Coding+Interview%3A+150+Programming+Interview+Questio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0daca0e41e5a84424d4143589633e2c0a2aca80a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,172,160,228,30,90,132,66,77,65,67,88,150,51,226,192,162,172,168,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
