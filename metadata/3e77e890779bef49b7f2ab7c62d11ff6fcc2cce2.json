Each technique addresses a specific task youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll face, like querying big data using Pig or writing a log file loader. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll explore each problem step by step, learning both how to build and deploy that specific solution along with the thinking that went into its design. As you work through the tasks, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find yourself growing more comfortable with Hadoop and at home in the world of big data.\n\nThis book assumes the reader knows the basics of Hadoop.\n\nWhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Inside\n- Conceptual overview of Hadoop and MapReduce\n- 85 practical, tested techniques\n- Real problems, real solutions\n- How to integrate MapReduce and R\n\nTable of Contents\nPart 1: Background and Fundamentals\nChapter 1.
