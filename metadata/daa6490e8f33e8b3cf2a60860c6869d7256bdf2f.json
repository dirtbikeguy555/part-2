Swedish Jose Gonzales does a very fine job with this singer/songwriter production. One of the best albums in 2003, not like the ususal commercial crap the record companies spits out on a daily basis.\n\nIf you haven't heard this album before, don't miss out on this opportunity!\nVery soft and moody, the kind of music you want to make out to ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:daa6490e8f33e8b3cf2a60860c6869d7256bdf2f","amp;dn":"Jose+Gonzales-Veneer-2003-CTA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"daa6490e8f33e8b3cf2a60860c6869d7256bdf2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,166,73,14,143,51,232,179,207,42,96,134,12,104,105,215,37,107,223,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
