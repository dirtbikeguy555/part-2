The two men debated the political problems faced by society, and the technological solutions engendered by the global networkÃ¢â‚¬â€from the Arab Spring to Bitcoin. They outlined radically opposing perspectives: for Assange, the liberating power of the Internet is based on its freedom and statelessness. For Schmidt, emancipation is at one with US foreign policy objectives and is driven by connecting non-Western countries to American companies and markets. These differences embodied a tug-of-war over the InternetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s future that has only gathered force subsequently.\n\nWhen Google Met WikiLeaks presents the story of Assange and SchmidtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s encounter. Both fascinating and alarming, it contains an edited transcript of their conversation and extensive, new material, written by Assange specifically for this book, providing the best available summary of his vision for the future of the Internet. \n\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nFormati: Epub Mobi Azw3 Pdf\nEditore: OR Books (20 novembre 2014)\nVenduto da: Amazon Media EU S.ÃƒÂ  r.l.\nLingua: Inglese\nASIN: B00PYZONM2\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/zO9CgDf.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81545302bb98422ecd2667ea56f2bc2af587339f","amp;dn":"Julian+Assange+-+When+Google+Met+WikiLeaks++%5BEbook+-+Eng%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81545302bb98422ecd2667ea56f2bc2af587339f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,84,83,2,187,152,66,46,205,38,103,234,86,242,188,42,245,135,51,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
