Those who do not vow their blood and bodies to the Emperor risk the execution of their loved ones and the destruction of all they hold dear.\n\nIt is in this brutal world, inspired by ancient Rome, that Laia lives with her grandparents and older brother. The family ekes out an existence in the EmpireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impoverished backstreets. They do not challenge the Empire.

In exchange for help from rebels who promise to rescue her brother, she will risk her life to spy for them from within the EmpireÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest military academy.\n\nThere, Laia meets Elias, the schoolÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s finest soldierÃ¢â‚¬â€and secretly, its most unwilling. Elias wants only to be free of the tyranny heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s being trained to enforce. He and Laia will soon realize that their destinies are intertwinedÃ¢â‚¬â€and that their choices will change the fate of the Empire itself","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38e0838f28efb95382ea3d066f064d02273eb33d","amp;dn":"An+Ember+In+The+Ashes+-+Sabaa+Tahir","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38e0838f28efb95382ea3d066f064d02273eb33d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,224,131,143,40,239,185,83,130,234,61,6,111,6,77,2,39,62,179,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
