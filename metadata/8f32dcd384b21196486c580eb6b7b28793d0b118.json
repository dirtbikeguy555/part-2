VIruz did all the real work.\n\n----\n\nUpdate 01.038.008 (10/07/14)\n\nSummary:\nSteering wheels and wheel controls have been added in Space Engineers. Players can now build and control vehicles. Every block that is visible in terminal can be now displayed on HUD (set on/off on terminal screen). Also some issues with Factions have been resolved (see the list below for more details).\n\nNote: wheels in multi-player are still work-in-progress and some things might not be functioning properly \n\n\nFeatures:\n- steering wheels (sounds are placeholders Ã¢â‚¬â€œ wheels in multi-player are still WIP)\n- wheel controls (WSAD)\n- adjustable welder and grinder speed (in world settings)\n- name and location of blocks visible in terminal can be shown on HUD\n- new inventory filter (hide empty inventories)\n- join game search box\n- hacking computers is a bit slower (grinding block of non-friend is slower by factor of 3)\n\nFixes:\n- fixed some Factions issues (turrets shooting on it's own ship, non-changeable ownership)\n- reduced network bandwidth during line/plane building\n- fixed beacon range and visibility\n- fixed issue when beacon broadcast was killing the server\n- fixed issue when antenna was working without power\n- fixed red circle after re-spawn\n- fixed beacon broadcast distance does not save\n- fixed old save files have no ownership\n\nUpdate 01.037.014 (04/07/14)\n\n- removed computer component from large ship thrusters\n- removed computer component from conveyors (so turret won't attack it)\n- fixed crash when server selects all objects on the grid and sets &quot;Me&quot; as owner and &quot;share with my faction&quot;\n- fixed cannot save issue after cargo ship permissions changes\n- fixed crash in factions after changing faction properties or members\n- fixed crash when closing faction screen\n- fixed crash when mining asteroid\n- fixed crash when switching characterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s light\n- fixed crash when client canceled join request or joined other faction\n- fixed crash when character was shooting when died\n- fixed crash caused by selecting empty space in ownership (there are no empty options in ownership drop down menu)\n- fixed crash when client was trying to join a faction multiple times\n- fixed server steals all ownership\n\nUpdate 01.037.012 (04/07/14)\n\nSummary:\nFactions are now available in Space Engineers. Players can create and join factions, determine ownership of blocks and manage the relations between them (hostile/ally). Block ownership is determined by computers, so if players want to take over hostile blocks, they will have to replace the computers that are in these blocks. Ownership can be transferred manually by the owner. Blocks can be shared within faction members or everyone.\n \nIMPORTANT NOTE: Factions are still Work-in-Progress and this is only the first update. There are still many things to be added during the next weeks (eg. chat and communication) and some bugs/issues are yet to be fixed. We decided to release it now so we can get the best feedback possible from the players.\n\n\nFeatures:\n- factions\n- ownership of blocks\n- hacking/take-over of hostile objects\n- block sharing\n- looting dead engineer\n- copy/paste: rotate object before pasting\n \nFixes:\n- fixed mirroring planes not visible\n- fixed extreme lag issues in some worlds\n- fixed issue with having access to control panel from passenger seat\n- fixed wrong highlight on door model\n- fixed missing dialog box in main menu and pause screen\n- fixed dedicated server issue: clean exit with save not working\n- fixed issue with NPC ships not de-spawning\n- fixed world name file folders aren't updating with &quot;Save As&quot; feature\n- fixed crashes and asteroid physics\n- fixed issue when connecting via connector deletes grouping\n- fixed copy+paste option for dedicated server setup\n- fixed missing thruster effect\n- fixed weird character animations with tools &amp; cube placement\n\nUpdate 01.036.009 (26/06/14)\n\nFeatures:\n- conveyor-connector system is fully functional\n- set custom color to astronautÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s suit \n- passenger seat\n- copy-paste the grids which are connected through rotors\n- items ejected from the ejector now inherit velocity\n \nFixes:\n- fixed weird/purple colors (especially visible on asteroids)\n- fixed hand drill issue\n- fixed clustered cargo ships in MP consuming server memory causing high ping\n- fixed control groups after merging/splitting\n- fixed issue with merge block causing CTD and stops Dedicated Server\n- fixed issue when switching while in load screen by using ALT-TAB and load worlds list stays blank\n- fixed issue when connectors could not connect if mounted to the same ship\n- fixed crash when merging small ships\n- fixed pink textures on asteroids\n- fixed dedicated server crash when socket is already in use\n- fixed few instances where mining is not working\n- fixed some symmetry is off (Cockpit 3 Large, Cockpit 1 Small.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f32dcd384b21196486c580eb6b7b28793d0b118","amp;dn":"Space+Engineers+v01.038.008+by+VIruz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f32dcd384b21196486c580eb6b7b28793d0b118","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,50,220,211,132,178,17,150,72,108,88,14,182,183,178,135,147,208,177,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
