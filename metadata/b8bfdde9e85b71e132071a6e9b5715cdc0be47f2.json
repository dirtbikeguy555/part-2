The program concerned a high-tech military helicopter, code named Airwolf, and her crew as they undertook various missions, many involving espionage, with a Cold War theme.\n\nThe show was created by Donald Bellisario. The first three seasons starred Jan-Michael Vincent, Ernest Borgnine, Alex Cord,\n\nThe series' protagonist is Stringfellow Hawke (Jan-Michael Vincent), a loner who lives in a cabin outside of Los Angeles, CA in a mountain resort area called Big Bear, accompanied only by his Bluetick Coonhound, &quot;Tet&quot;, and the surrounding wildlife. Hawke is a recluse, spending most of his time alone with his priceless collection of paintings which he inherited from his grandfather (the art was a gift for his grandmother), and serenading eagles with his equally priceless Stradivarius cello. His only real friend and mentor is the older, eternally cheerful Dominic Santini (Ernest Borgnine) who raised Stringfellow and his brother Saint John (pronounced &quot;sin-jin&quot;) after their parents died. Stringfellow's father and Dominic flew in World War II together.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086862/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086862/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8bfdde9e85b71e132071a6e9b5715cdc0be47f2","amp;dn":"Airwolf+Season+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8bfdde9e85b71e132071a6e9b5715cdc0be47f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,191,221,233,232,91,113,225,50,7,26,110,155,87,21,205,192,190,71,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
