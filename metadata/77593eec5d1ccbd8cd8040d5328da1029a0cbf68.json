Unfortunately for them, there&amp;#039;s Veronica Mars, a smart, fearless 17-year-old apprentice private investigator dedicated to solving the town&amp;#039;s toughest mysteries. Veronica used to be one of the popular girls, but it all came crumbling down around her after her best friend, Lilly, was murdered, and her then-sheriff father, Keith, was removed from office for naming Lilly&amp;#039;s rich father as the lead suspect. During the day, Veronica must negotiate high school like any average teenage girl. But at night, she helps with her father&amp;#039;s struggling, new private investigator business--and what she finds may tear the town of Neptune apart at the seams.\n\nTAIKONAUT","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77593eec5d1ccbd8cd8040d5328da1029a0cbf68","amp;dn":"Veronica+Mars+seanson+1%2C+2+and+3-Taikonaut","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77593eec5d1ccbd8cd8040d5328da1029a0cbf68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,89,62,236,93,28,203,216,205,128,64,213,50,141,161,2,154,12,191,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
