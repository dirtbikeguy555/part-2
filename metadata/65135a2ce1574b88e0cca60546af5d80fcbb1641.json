The game's focus is on the SAS and Delta Force teams operating in and around Iraq during the time of the Gulf War. Players must lead a squad of soldiers charged with the task of defending Kuwait against the Iraqi invasion. Players will once again need to balance the need for action against the need for survival in a series of 10 missions designed to fulfill operation objectives.\n\nBack to Baghdad takes players further into Kuwait as they try to neutralize scud missile installations, prevent the use of chemical weapons, free prisoners of war, and oust Hussein's Republican Guard from their entrenched position within Kuwait City. Each SAS and Delta Force squad consists of a team leader, combat engineer, sniper, and heavy weapons specialist.
