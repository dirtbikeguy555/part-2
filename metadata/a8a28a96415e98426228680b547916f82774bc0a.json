Smith\nEPUB\nYoung adult novel\n\nToday should be one of the worst days of seventeen-year-old Hadley Sullivan's life. Having missed her flight, she's stuck at JFK airport and late to her father's second wedding, which is taking place in London and involves a soon-to-be stepmother Hadley's never even met. Then she meets the perfect boy in the airport's cramped waiting area. His name is Oliver, he's British, and he's sitting in her row.\n\nQuirks of timing play out in this romantic and cinematic novel about family connections, second chances, and first loves. Set over a twenty-four-hour-period, Hadley and Oliver's story will make you believe that true love finds you when you're least expecting it.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8a28a96415e98426228680b547916f82774bc0a","amp;dn":"The+Statistical+Probability+of+Love+at+First+Sight+-+Jennifer+E.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8a28a96415e98426228680b547916f82774bc0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,162,138,150,65,94,152,66,98,40,104,11,84,121,22,248,39,116,188,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
