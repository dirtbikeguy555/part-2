His social and political views are contrarian, but always sincere. The twisted things he says are what he believes, he?s come to them using his own dark logic. His belief in what he says - it?s not just ?material? - is probably why sometimes he gets visceral responses from audiences, often inducing walkouts not ready for the truth as Stanhope sees it.\n\nStanhope often draws comparisons to Bill Hicks and Lenny Bruce, but he mostly doesn?t see it.\n\nContained are live recordings from 7 different shows in mp3:\n- Deadbeat Hero\n- Die Laughing\n- Sicko\n- Something To Take The Edge Off\n- The Great White Stanhope\n- Live @ Wiseacres (XM Bootleg)\n- ACID Bootleg\n\nEnjoy\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e187f9990f324e46eed470d64c9a7790af212c6","amp;dn":"Standup+Comedy+-+Doug+Stanhope+-+7+Albums+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e187f9990f324e46eed470d64c9a7790af212c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,24,127,153,144,243,36,228,110,237,71,13,100,201,167,121,10,242,18,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
