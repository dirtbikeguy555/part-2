Sometimes they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust\n    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. \n    \n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause\n    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow \n    apps &amp; malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is\n    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull &amp; Crossbones icon are trusted.\n\n06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously\n    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and\n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.\n\n10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result\n    in getting banned from TPB!\n\nRequests?
