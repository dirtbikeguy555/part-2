If Sly Stone and Jimi Hendrix took a space ship to India together, they very well might have come up with something approximating On The Corner. This utterly unique and unprecedented recording was savaged by a lot of the critics of its day. They blasted Miles for creating a new &quot;anti-jazz&quot; that fundamentally violated the genre&amp;#039;s integrity. Reviled as the jazz anti-Christ, his playing on this recording was indeed demonic. His trumpet spits out wah-wah distorted licks of fire and nastiness, and he grinds on the organ like it was a cheap date. He masterfully tangles and intertwines the varied sounds of the sitar, conga, electric guitar, tabla, organ, and electric bass to create thickly-layered rhythms of dazzling complexity. He throws in some heavy licks on top of it all, hitting hard with quick and punchy bursts from his horn that make the groove throb. This explosive session is anything but harmless, as it still remains the album that the purists most love to hate. Brimming with the risky inventiveness of untested ideas, Miles pushed the envelope a little too far for many of the less visionary critics with On The Corner. If Bitches Brew was the first bombshell Miles dropped on the jazz world, this surely was the second. Still, with both recordings, Miles showed why its better to burn as a devil in the fire than rot as an angel in the wings.\n---John Ballon\n\n1.On The Corner / New York Girl / Thinkin&amp;#039; Of One Thing And Doin&amp;#039; Another / Vote For Miles\n2.Black Satin\n3.One And One\n4.Helen Butte / Mr. Freedom X\n\nPlayers:\nMiles Davis: Trumpet\nBadal Roy: Tabla\nColin Walcott: Sitar\nChick Corea: Keyboard\nHerbie Hancock: Keyboard\nHarold I.
