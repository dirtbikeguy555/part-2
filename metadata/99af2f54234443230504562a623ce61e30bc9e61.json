Hall &amp; Oates' music was remarkably well constructed and produced; at their best, their songs were filled with strong hooks and melodies that adhered to soul traditions without being a slave to them by incorporating elements of new wave and hard rock.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tR&amp;B/Soul\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Sara Smile\n02.She's Gone\n03.Rich Girl\n04.Wait For Me\n05.Kiss On My List\n06.I Can't Go For That (No Can Do)\n07.Private Eyes\n08.Maneater\n09.One On One\n10.Family Man\n11.Say It Isn't So\n12.Adult Education\n13.Out Of Touch\n14.Method Of Modern Love\n15.Everything Your Heart Desires\n16.So Close\n17.Starting All Over Again\n18.I Can't Go For That (No Can Do) (Hoax Remix)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                   ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99af2f54234443230504562a623ce61e30bc9e61","amp;dn":"Daryl+Hall+%26+John+Oates+-+The+Essential+%282001%29+mp3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99af2f54234443230504562a623ce61e30bc9e61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,175,47,84,35,68,67,35,5,4,86,42,98,60,230,30,48,188,158,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
