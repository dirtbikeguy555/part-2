From about 1987 on (around the time of Death Before Dishonour) they changed into a crossover thrash band. Formed in Edinburgh by ex-soldier Wattie Buchan, they signed to Secret Records in March 1981 and released their debut EP Army Life. The album Punks Not Dead followed in the same year. Despite many lineup changes, the band continued into the 2000s and has developed a worldwide following. \nThe band are currently writing material for a new album ........AND I CAN'T WAIT!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09a098588bcbc298a52163ab18a4143d4830d04f","amp;dn":"The+Exploited+Studio+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09a098588bcbc298a52163ab18a4143d4830d04f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,160,152,88,139,203,194,152,165,33,99,171,24,164,20,61,72,48,208,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
