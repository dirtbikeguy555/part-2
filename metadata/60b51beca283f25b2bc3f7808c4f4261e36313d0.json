Or maybe not. Durbeyfield sends his daughter Tess to check on a family named d&amp;#039;Uberville living in a manor house less than a day&amp;#039;s carriage ride away. Alec d&amp;#039;Urberville is delighted to meet his beautiful &quot;cousin&quot; and seduces her with strawberries and roses. Actually Alec has gotten his illustrious name and coat of arms by purchasing them. Tess too takes up the game of illusion when she finds, loses and finds again her true love Angel.\n\n4cory@mea","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60b51beca283f25b2bc3f7808c4f4261e36313d0","amp;dn":"Roman+Polanski+1979+-+TESS+XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60b51beca283f25b2bc3f7808c4f4261e36313d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,181,27,236,162,131,242,91,43,195,247,128,140,79,66,97,227,99,19,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
