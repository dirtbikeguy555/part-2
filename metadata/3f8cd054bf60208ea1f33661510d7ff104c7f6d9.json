Witnessing the horrors of slavery, bilked out of his inheritance, and blamed in his youth for a murder he didn't commit, E.J. developed a reputation for violence that preceded him everywhere he went. Finally, it brought him to a tragic and bloody end as his family watched in helpless horror. Borrowing an old local tale about a man who was killed by his neighbors, Matthiessen creates a powerful character. George Guidall's excellent reading brings this moving tragedy home to us with a passion","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f8cd054bf60208ea1f33661510d7ff104c7f6d9","amp;dn":"Peter+Matthiessen-Bone+by+Bone","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f8cd054bf60208ea1f33661510d7ff104c7f6d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,140,208,84,191,96,32,142,161,243,54,97,81,13,127,241,4,199,246,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
