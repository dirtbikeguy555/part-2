What came to be known as Fermat's Last Theorem looked simple; proving it, however, became the Holy Grail of mathematics, baffling its finest minds for more than 350 years.  In Fermat's Enigma--based on the author's award-winning documentary film, which aired on PBS's &quot;Nova&quot;--Simon Singh tells the astonishingly entertaining story of the pursuit of that grail, and the lives that were devoted to, sacrificed for, and saved by it.  Here is a mesmerizing tale of heartbreak and mastery that will forever change your feelings about mathematics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20cd19b7d4981c781c0a07971c313525a2781d15","amp;dn":"Fermat%27s+Last+Theorem","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20cd19b7d4981c781c0a07971c313525a2781d15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,205,25,183,212,152,28,120,28,10,7,151,28,49,53,37,162,120,29,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
