Major William Cage (Cruise) is an \n\nofficer who has never seen a day of combat when he is unceremoniously dropped into what amounts to a suicide mission. Killed within minutes, \n\nCage now finds himself inexplicably thrown into a time loop-forcing him to live out the same brutal combat over and over, fighting and dying \n\nagain...and again. But with each battle, Cage becomes able to engage the adversaries with increasing skill, alongside Special Forces warrior \n\nRita Vrataski (Blunt). And, as Cage and Vrataski take the fight to the aliens, each repeated encounter gets them one step closer to defeating \n\nthe enemy.\n\nSource: Edge of Tomorrow 2014 1080p BluRay x264-SPARKS\n\nFormat                         : MPEG-4\nFile size                      : 2.35 GiB\nDuration                       : 1h 53mn\nOverall bit rate               : 2 960 Kbps\n\nVideo\n\nFormat                         : HEVC [X265]\nBit rate                       : 2 574 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate               : 19.7 Mbps\nWidth                          : 1 920 pixels\nHeight                         : 800 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio           : 2.40:1\nFrame rate                     : 23.976 fps\nStream size                    : 2.04 GiB (87%)\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                         : AC-3\nBit rate                       : 384 Kbps\nChannel(s)                     : 6 channels (5.1)\nSampling rate                  : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                      : 16 bits\nCompression mode               : Lossy\nStream size                    : 312 MiB (13%)\n\nSubtitles: English (External)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8aabfa9fde2bb751428de8c00cba39acf8684155","amp;dn":"Edge+of+Tomorrow+2014+1080p+BluRay+X265","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8aabfa9fde2bb751428de8c00cba39acf8684155","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,171,250,159,222,43,183,81,66,141,232,192,12,186,57,172,248,104,65,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
