It explains the hidden meanings of silences, body language, expression and tone and it shows how to get on someone's wavelength and how to speak someone's language.\nThis book develops further the system of self-defense against verbal abuse presented in The Gentle Art of Verbal Self-Defense (Prentice-Hall, 1980). If you haven't read that book and can't conveniently get a copy, you will still be able to use this intermediate book; the basic terms and concepts you might need for that purpose are explained in the Appendix beginning on page 266.\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s14.postimg.org/ovtp2vcqp/elgin.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s14.postimg.org/ovtp2vcqp/elgin.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzette_Haden_Elgin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzette_Haden_Elgin&lt;/a&gt;\nSuzette Haden Elgin (born Patricia Anne Wilkins; November 18, 1936 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ January 27, 2015) was an American science fiction author.
