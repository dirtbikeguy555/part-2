You also must uninstall \r\n\r\nand then install the content for 3.3.5.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course it contains cracked API.dll and SDK if someone is interested. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt not my work, just uploading it to share. \r\n\r\nChears Dace","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96b05ca2b0cd8d6e35b6f5f30a7deb8cc3f9c5dd","amp;dn":"%5BP3D%5D+Prepar3D+v3+Professional+Plus+3.3.5.17625","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96b05ca2b0cd8d6e35b6f5f30a7deb8cc3f9c5dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,176,92,162,176,205,141,110,53,182,245,243,10,125,235,140,195,249,197,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
