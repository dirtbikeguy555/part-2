O.A.R. has always been a band that reveled in the hacky sack inclusiveness of the jam band scene, offering up an easy, melodic, and always danceable infusion of '90s college rock and suburban reggae-pop that fell somewhere between DMB, Rusted Root, Ziggy Marley, and the Goo Goo Dolls, and Rockville is no exception, especially on cuts like &quot;Two Hands Up,&quot; &quot;The Architect,&quot; and &quot;Favorite Song.&quot;\n\nTrack List:\n***********\n01 Two Hands Up\n02 We'll Pick Up Where We Left Off\n03 Peace\n04 The Element\n05 Favorite Song\n06 So Good So Far\n07 The Architect\n08 Place to Hide\n09 Caroline the Wrecking Ball\n10 I Will Find You\n\nAudio Info:\n***********\n\nAudio\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nMode : Joint stereo\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\nWriting library : LAME3.99.5","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f49bc715bd2f8dcd96558941ccca73dafa826ddb","amp;dn":"O.A.R.+-+The+Rockville+LP%5BMp3-320kbps-2014%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f49bc715bd2f8dcd96558941ccca73dafa826ddb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,155,199,21,189,47,141,205,150,85,137,65,204,202,115,218,250,130,109,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
