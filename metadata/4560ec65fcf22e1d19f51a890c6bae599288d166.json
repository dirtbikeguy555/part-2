Burn or Mount and install Drakan: Order of the Flame (FULL INSTALL).\n 2. Apply the build 445 update to patch the game to the latest version.\n 3. Install the Drakan: 10th Anniversary MOD. (OPTIONAL)\n\n\nNOTE\n\n\nThe MOD should render the game playable on Windows 7 &amp; 8.\n\n Drakan: 10th Anniversary is a mod for Drakan: The Order of the Flame fixing the majority of known bugs and adding new graphic effects based on an additional DirectX 9 rendering engine. This allows for previously unavailable effects such as normal mapping, depth of field, motion blur, etc.\n\nIt does not add/modify gameplay/monsters/weapons/quests in the game! It simply improves itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s graphics.\n\n The MOD does not alter game files, so even if you install it, you can still play the original without any issues. No matter what version you play save game are interchangeable. (itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s better to install it and use it when you want to exit a certain area of the map that keeps crashing your game and prevents you from advancing forward in Drakan)\n\nThe game seems to work flawlessly even without the graphics mod on Radeon cards running AMD Catalyst 11.12 (other drivers seem to make the game crash).\n\n\nEnjoy &amp; Seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4560ec65fcf22e1d19f51a890c6bae599288d166","amp;dn":"Drakan+-+Order+of+the+Flame+%2B+Win7+MOD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4560ec65fcf22e1d19f51a890c6bae599288d166","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,96,236,101,252,242,46,29,25,245,26,137,12,107,174,89,146,136,209,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
