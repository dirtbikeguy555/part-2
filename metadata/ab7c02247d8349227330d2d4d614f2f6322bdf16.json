Musicians and producers featured on the album includes Tek-One, Robot Sonic, Ben Weinman from The Dillinger Escape Plan, Outcry Collective, LÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Amour La Morgue (Ian Watkins from Lostprophets), Utah Saints and Shawn Crahan from Slipknot. Sykes also stated that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not a song on there that really sounds like the original. WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s great though is the diversity of each song. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s dub-step to hip-hop, electro to drum and bassÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\n1. \t&quot;The Comedown&quot; (RobotSonics) \t5:17\n\n2. \t&quot;Chelsea Smile&quot; (KC Blitz) \t4:12\n\n3. \t&quot;It Was Written in Blood&quot; (L'Amour La Morgue (Ian Watkins) \t4:58\n\n4. \t&quot;Death Breath&quot; (Toxic Avenger) \t4:33\n\n5. \t&quot;Football Season Is Over&quot; (After The Night) \t3:57\n\n6. \t&quot;Sleep With One Eye Open&quot; (Tek One) \t4:41\n\n7. \t&quot;Diamonds Aren't Forever&quot; (I Haunt Wizards) \t3:55\n\n8. \t&quot;The Sadness Will Never End&quot; (Sonny Moore) \t6:03\n\n9. \t&quot;No Need For Introductions, I've Read About Girls Like You on the Backs of Toilet Doors&quot; (Ben Weinman from Dillinger Escape Plan) \t2:46\n\n10. \t&quot;Suicide Season&quot; (The Secret Handshake) \t2:56\n\n11. \t&quot;Football Season Is Over&quot; (Utah Saints) \t5:03\n\n12. \t&quot;Sleep With One Eye Open&quot; (Shawn &quot;Clown&quot; Crahan of Slipknot) \t5:55\n\n13. \t&quot;Chelsea Smile&quot; (Travis McCoy) \t3:42\n\n14. \t&quot;Suicide Season&quot; (Outcry Collective) \t5:05\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab7c02247d8349227330d2d4d614f2f6322bdf16","amp;dn":"Bring+Me+The+Horizon+-+Suicide+Season-Cut+Up","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab7c02247d8349227330d2d4d614f2f6322bdf16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,124,2,36,125,131,73,34,115,48,210,212,214,20,242,246,50,43,223,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
