Statistics is all around us in our daily lives, and Triola is dedicated to finding new real-world examples and data sets for you to use in your classroom.\n\n \n\nThe Eleventh Edition contains more than 2000 exercises, 87% of which are new, and 82% of which use real data. It also contains hundreds of examples, 86% of which are new and 94% of which use real data. By analyzing real data, students are able to connect abstract concepts to the world at large. As a result, they gain conceptual understanding and learn to think statistically, using the same methods that professional statisticians employ.\n\n \n# Hardcover: 896 pages\n# Publisher: Addison Wesley; 11 edition (January 7, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0321500245\n# ISBN-13: 978-0321500243","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dbbc84a47206c25f38a8da07007f728ec8413f3","amp;dn":"Elementary+Statistics+%2C11th+Edition+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dbbc84a47206c25f38a8da07007f728ec8413f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,187,200,74,71,32,108,37,243,138,141,160,112,7,247,40,236,132,19,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
