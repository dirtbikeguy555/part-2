It also featured guest vocals by Elliott, Bilal, and BeatClub Records' Ms. Jade, and included a bonus track performed by Elliott, &quot;Big Spender&quot;, which samples the song of the same name from the 1966 musical Sweet Charity. After the successful lead single, the album spawned another two, the Timbaland-produced &quot;Call Me&quot; and the radio single &quot;Smoking Cigarettes&quot;, which had a video shot for it directed by Little X, but was never released.\n\n\n\n- Encoded in mp3 best quality, Constant Bit Rate 320 kbps, enjoy :)-\n\n\n\n*** TRACKLIST ***\n1. \t&quot;So Much to Say (Intro)&quot;  \n2. \t&quot;My Place&quot; \n3. \t&quot;Smoking Cigarettes&quot;\n4. \t&quot;Best Friend&quot; (featuring Bilal)\n5. \t&quot;Always Will&quot;  \n6. \t&quot;Boogie 2nite&quot; \n7. \t&quot;Oops (Oh My)&quot; (featuring Missy &quot;Misdemeanor&quot; Elliott)\n8. \t&quot;Make Ur Move&quot; \n9. \t&quot;Motel&quot;  \n10. \t&quot;Beautiful&quot;  \n11. \t&quot;Complain&quot;  \n12. \t&quot;Heaven&quot; \n13. \t&quot;Call Me&quot;  \n14. \t&quot;Drunk&quot; \n15. \t&quot;Southern Hummingbird (Outro)&quot;  \n16. \t&quot;Sexual Healing (Oops Pt. 2)&quot; (featuring Ms. Jade)\n17. \t&quot;Big Spender&quot; (performed by Missy &quot;Misdemeanor&quot; Elliott)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aef30d3c2b7d0f6a2b2b147516f8c392677434a0","amp;dn":"Tweet+-+Southern+Hummingbird+%5B2002+RnB%5D+320+kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aef30d3c2b7d0f6a2b2b147516f8c392677434a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,243,13,60,43,125,15,106,43,43,20,117,22,248,195,146,103,116,52,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
