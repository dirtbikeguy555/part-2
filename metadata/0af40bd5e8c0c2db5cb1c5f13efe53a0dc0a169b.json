It established the mutual gains approach to negotiation, or what the popular media likes to call &quot;win-win negotiation&quot;. But there are few, if any, negotiating situations in which everyone can get everything they want.\n\nIn reality, most people want to win at win-win negotiation. And the way to win is to come up with a proposed agreement that is &quot;good&quot; for the other side and &quot;great&quot; for you.\n\nGood for You, Great for Me provides the missing operational guidelines for winning negotiations in business, family disputes, international relations, or public affairs, without undermining trust or ruining relationships. It provides not just new principles but new tools - six operational steps to take after youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve found your way into the trading zone - to ensure you get as large a share of the pie as possible.
