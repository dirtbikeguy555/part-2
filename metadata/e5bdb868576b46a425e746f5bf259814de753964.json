Japan bombs Pearl Harbor. The Caliphs of Baghdad spend themselves into bankruptcy. The Aztecs greet the Conquistadors with open arms. Mexico invites the Americans to Texas-and the Americans never leave. \n\nAnd the rest is history...\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nLiked it?
