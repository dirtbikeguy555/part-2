Satyr and Frost have been the band's core members since 1993. The band's first three albums typify the Norwegian black metal style. Since its fourth album in 1999, the band has strayed from this style and included elements of hard rock in their sound. Satyricon was the first Norwegian black metal band to join a multi-national record label (EMI).\nimage\nThe band were formed in 1990 as Eczema by the bassist Wargod and drummer Exhurtum. In 1991, they decided to start playing black metal, so the name was changed to Satyricon. Satyr (Sigurd Wongraven) then joined the band. After the first demo All Evil, Exhurtum was kicked out of the band because he &quot;preferred hanging out with my girl at the time rather than kicking down gravestones together with the band&quot;, while Wargod left the music scene and became a UN soldier afterwards. Lemarchand was kicked out after the second demo. Remaining members Satyr and Lemarchand hired the drummer Frost (Kjetil-Vidar Haraldstad) as a session musician and recorded their second and last demo, The Forest Is My Throne. Shortly after this, Lemarchand also left the band. But before leaving the band he recorded guitars (uncredited on the booklet) for the first full-length album, Dark Medieval Times. In the meantime, Frost was being &quot;promoted&quot; as a permanent member and had recorded drums for the aforementioned album. Satyricon haveÃ¢â‚¬â€with two exceptionsÃ¢â‚¬â€been a two-man band ever since: from 1993Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1996, Tomas ThormodsÃƒÂ¦ter 'Samoth' Haugen from Emperor was the bassist and guitarist of Satyricon, and participated in the recording of their second album, The Shadowthrone; and later, in 1996, Darkthrone member Nocturno Culto (Ted Skjellum, known as &quot;Kveldulv&quot; during Satyricon's period) became guitarist on the third full-length Satyricon album, Nemesis Divina.\n\nRebel Extravaganza, Satyricon's fourth album, was released in 1999. During this period Satyr drastically changed his look by shaving off his hair, as seen in the photoshoot for the album as well as their live performances.\nimage\nIn April and May 2000, Satyricon toured as a supporting band for Pantera. Phil Anselmo has spoken of his love for black metal numerous times, and has participated in Eibon with Satyricon frontman Satyr.They used to be signed with Daron Malakian's music label EatUrMusic.\nimage\nTheir fifth studio album Volcano was released in 2002 and won four awards: the Norwegian Grammy for Best Metal Album, an Alarm award for the track &quot;Fuel for Hatred&quot; in the category Song of the Year, the Alarm Award for Metal Album of the Year and The Oslo award for Best Overall Album.\n\nSatyricon participated in the Darkthrone tribute Darkthrone Holy Darkthrone, released by Moonfog Productions in 1998, covering the song &quot;Kathaarian Life Code&quot;. In the same year, Satyricon participated in the Bathory tribute In Conspiracy with Satan, released by Hellspawn/No Fashion Records, featuring the song &quot;Born for Burning&quot; originally released on Crusade from the North in 1996.\nimage\nIn 2006, Satyricon released Now, Diabolical.\n\nIn March 2008, the band headlined the Inferno Metal Festival in Oslo for the first time.\n\nThe EP My Skin Is Cold was released before their seventh album, The Age of Nero, which was released on 3 November 2008.\nimage\nSatyricon released their self-titled eighth full-length album on 9 September 2013.\n\nThe band are set to release their first ever Full Length live CD/DVD set titled 'Satyricon - Live at the Opera' which was filmed in September 2013, featuring the band alongside the Norwegian national Opera, and is to be released on 4 May 2015.\nimage\n\nTracklist\n\n01.
