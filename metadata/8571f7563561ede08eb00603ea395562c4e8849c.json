This book is provided to give a broad, in-depth overview of the field of Fuzzy Logic. The basic principles of Fuzzy Logic are discussed in detail with various solved examples. The different approaches and solutions to the problems given in the book are well balanced and pertinent to the Fuzzy Logic research projects. The applications of Fuzzy Logic are also dealt to make the readers understand the concept of Fuzzy Logic. The solutions to the problems are programmed using MATLAB 6.0 and the simulated results are given. The MATLAB Fuzzy Logic toolbox is provided for easy reference.\n\nTitle: Introduction to Fuzzy Logic using MATLAB\nAuthor: Sivanandam S.N.\nPublisher: Springer\nYear: 2006\nFormat: PDF\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
