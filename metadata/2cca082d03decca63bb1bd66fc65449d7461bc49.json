Of the four founding members, only Hugh Cornwell had any kind of recognizable historical pedigree, having played alongside Richard Thompson in the schoolboy band Emil &amp; the Detectives. According to Thompson, their repertoire stretched from &quot;Smokestack Lightning&quot; and the blues, through to &quot;old Kiki Dee B-sides,&quot; while their gigging was largely confined to the Hornsey School of Art, where Thompson's sister was Social Secretary. \n\nThe Guildford Stranglers were confined to a similar circuit. It was 1975 before they ventured into even the London suburbs, although once there -- and having shortened their name to the less parochial Stranglers -- things began moving quickly. The established pub rock scene was dying and promoters were willing to give any unknown band a break, simply to try and establish a new hierarchy. Thus it was that as the first stirrings of punk began to make their own presence felt on the same circuit, the Stranglers were on board the bandwagon from the beginning.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tAlternative\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Peaches\n02.Something Better Change\n03.No More Heroes\n04.Walk On By\n05.Duchess\n06.Golden Brown\n07.Strange Little Girl\n08.European Female\n09.Skin Deep\n10.Nice In Nice\n11.Always The Sun\n12.Big In America\n13.All Day And All Of The Night\n14.96 Tears\n15.No Mercy\n\n\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cca082d03decca63bb1bd66fc65449d7461bc49","amp;dn":"The+Stranglers+-+Greatest+Hits+1977-1990+%281990%29+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cca082d03decca63bb1bd66fc65449d7461bc49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,202,8,45,3,222,204,166,59,177,189,102,252,101,68,157,116,97,188,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
