His field is primarily comparative literature, and his work explores cultural and philosophical issues, particularly the anomalies of contemporary Western culture, translation and the nature of language and literature, and the impact of the Holocaust.  His best-known book, AFTER BABEL (1975), quickly established itself as both a controversial and seminal study of literary theory, and an early contribution to the field of translation studies.\n\nHis essays and books are always provocative and thrilling, addressing a broad range of topics, making new books, difficult ideas, and unfamiliar subjects seem compelling not only to intellectuals but to &quot;the common reader.&quot;  He possesses a famously dazzling mind: paganism, the Dutch Renaissance, childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s games, war-time Britain, HitlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bunker, and chivalry attract his interest as much as Levi-Strauss, Cellini, Bernhard, Chardin, Mandelstam, Kafka, Cardinal Newman, Verdi, Gogol, Borges, Brecht, Wittgenstein, Chomsky, and art historian/spy Anthony Blunt.  Central to Steiner's thinking, he has stated, &quot;is my astonishment, naÃƒÂ¯ve as it seems to people, that you can use human speech both to love, to build, to forgive, and also to torture, to hate, to destroy and to annihilate.&quot;\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format unless otherwise indicated.
