This book surveys major interests and institutions and examines how state and non-state actors pursue wealth and power. Emphasizing fundamental economic concepts as well as the interplay between domestic and international politics, International Political Economy not only explains how the global economy works; it also encourages readers to think critically about how economic policy is made in the context of globalization.\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1.
