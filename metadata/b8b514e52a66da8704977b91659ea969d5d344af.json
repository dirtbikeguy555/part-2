One day,\nupon checking his android's behavioral log, Rikuo, a student, noticed his android's returning times\nhave been odd recently. With his friend Masaki, they found out the place where his android, Sammy,\nhave been visiting: a small cafe called Eve no Jikan where androids and human are not seen as different.\nUpon talking with the &quot;people&quot; in the cafe and discovering more of Sammy's behavior, Rikuo changed his\nview about androids and treat them as friends rather than tools. At the same time, elsewhere in Japan, the\nEthics committee is trying to impose policies to reduce the involvement and use of androids in society.\n\nVIDEO\n- Video Source: BD International release\n- Video Codec: H.264/AVC\n- Video Resolution: 1280x720p HD (16:9)\n- Video FPS: 23.976\n\nAUDIO\n- Codec: AAC\n- Track 1: English: Stereo\n- Track 2: Japanese: Stereo\n\nSUBTITLES\n- Track 1: English Signs/Songs [ZUM]\n- Track 1: English Subtitles [ZUM]\n\nCOMMENTS\n- Credit goes to &quot;Zettai Unmei Mokushiroku&quot; [ZUM] for the English Subtitles!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8b514e52a66da8704977b91659ea969d5d344af","amp;dn":"%5BCBM%5D+Time+of+EVE+the+Movie+%28Dual+Audio%29+%5BBDRip-720p-8bit%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8b514e52a66da8704977b91659ea969d5d344af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,181,20,229,42,102,218,135,4,151,123,145,101,158,169,105,213,211,68,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
