The enemy was too powerful, too numerous, and utterly determined to exterminate humanity.\r\n\r\nBut the appearance of a new ally in the fight has changed all of that. For the first time since the original incursion, Wolfe thinks that maybe there's a chance to stop their implacable enemy before they have the chance to wipe out any more human planets. That opportunity comes at great cost, however, and even as he makes plans for their first offensive move on the Phage, Jackson is all too aware that most of them will not survive.\r\n\r\nRead by Mark Boyett\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abeb2bdfe771dd4ec645d333ce7ce2e5cc65f694","amp;dn":"Joshua+Dalzelle+-+Counterstrike+%28Black+Fleet+Trilogy+%233%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abeb2bdfe771dd4ec645d333ce7ce2e5cc65f694","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,235,43,223,231,113,221,78,198,69,211,51,206,124,226,229,204,101,246,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
