These were ripped from the 2-disc set.  They were presented by one big track for each disk.  However instead of making 2 big files (1 for each disc), I split up the files into approximately 30 minute chunks.  There are 9 files/parts altogether.  They were all split at an appropriate natural chapter break.\n\nSource: DVD Rip\nConstant Quality Rate Factor(CRF) of 19\n\nVIDEO:\nContainer: MKV\nCodec: x264\nResolution: 720 x 480 (4:3 aspect ration)\nfps: 29.97\n\nAUDIO: (untouched from DVDs)\nFormat: Dolby AC3 2.0\nBitrate: 192 Kbps\n3333333\nPlease seed when you are finished downloading. It seems a good rule of thumb is to upload at least as much as you've downloaded (1 to 1 ratio)...thanks!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCRF encoding maintains a constant quality for all encoded videos.  It adjusts the file size/bit-rate as needed (every video is different!) to maintain the desired quality. &quot;CRF&quot;...file sizes never too little and never too big...sized just right to maintain a constant high quality across the board.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n~Meech = Always: Untouched ac3 or dts audio, full resolution video, high-profile x264 settings, Larger files (only) when needed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cf3bcec8f33114bf25f7d235dbb721035a9715c","amp;dn":"Sesame.Street.40.Years.of.Sunny.Days.dvdrip.x264-MCH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cf3bcec8f33114bf25f7d235dbb721035a9715c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,243,188,236,143,51,17,75,242,95,125,35,93,187,114,16,53,169,113,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
