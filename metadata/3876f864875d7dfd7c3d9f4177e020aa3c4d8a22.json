As many of you know, I typically do not encode many movies that are already well represented in high quality and low file sizes, but most of the other low file size versions either suffer from excessively low bit rates and are therefore not conducive to viewing on screens any larger than computer monitors, or they do not include the director's commentary track and soft-coded subtitles. \n\nBitrates listed are variable, using multi-pass encoding for maximum quality, which means the numbers you see are average bitrates.\n\nPlease seed as long as possible, preferably until reaching a share ratio of at least 3:1.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3876f864875d7dfd7c3d9f4177e020aa3c4d8a22","amp;dn":"The+Shawshank+Redemption+%281994%29+%5B1080p%5D+x264+-+Jalucian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3876f864875d7dfd7c3d9f4177e020aa3c4d8a22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,118,248,100,135,93,125,253,124,61,159,65,119,224,32,170,60,77,138,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
