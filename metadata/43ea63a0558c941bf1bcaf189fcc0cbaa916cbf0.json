A Quick And Easy Method by John LaCarna\n\nOverview: This book uses a powerful mnemonic technique, the keyword method, to lock 1413 SAT and GRE words into the reader's memory quickly and easily. Dramatic improvements can be made in vocabulary size, reading comprehension, and scores on verbal exams. Since standard intelligence tests have significant verbal components, a major increase in vocabulary should increase IQ scores. Here's how it works: Take the word DEFENESTRATE, which means to throw out of a window. If you already know that word, you probably don't need this book. DEFENESTRATE is too limited in use to be in the book, but we want to demonstrate the method by having you actually learn a new word. The next time you encounter DEFENESTRATE, think DEFEND THE STREET. That's called the &quot;key.&quot; Now, to &quot;link&quot; the key to the definition, imagine your town invaded by enemy troops, and citizens defending the streets by throwing objects out of the windows at them.
