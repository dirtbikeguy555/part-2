The result is Magical Healing Mantras, a soothing and nourishing album of Indian devotional chants.\nLike a soft rain at the window, the gentle but steady rhythms of mantras&amp;#039; seven tracks lull their listener into a sweet state of tranquillity. The group weaves the sounds of guitar, sitar, flute and table (Indian kettle drums) to form a swirling, multi-textured backdrop for their soul-caressing vocals. The songs calm the mind with honey-flavored tones and hypnotic repetition.\nThe subtle chirping of crickets heard throughout &quot;Govindam&quot; gives one the feeling of being on a Nepalese hillside under a bright summer moon. The slightly up-tempo &quot;Jay Shree Krishna&quot; and &quot;Govinda Jaya Jaya&quot; raise the energy level just enough to keep the listener in a state of peaceful alertness. By the CD&amp;#039;s conclusion, the music has cast a spell of serenity that lasts long after the last note has ceases ringing.\nThe members of Namaste, who hail from France, Chile, Germany, and Japan, among other countries, have combined their diverse backgrounds and talents to birth a work of beauty and integrity. Massage practitioners and recipients who wish to avoid religious overtones may want to look elsewhere, but those with a taste for the spiritual are encouraged to light a candle and set forth on this cultured album&amp;#039;s healing journey.\nThe power of a mantra to heal and liberate lies in it&amp;#039;s vibration in the body. They are most effective when sung, especially in a group. There are some general techniques that facilitate the practice of using mantras: Take a few deep breaths and dispel any negativity that might interfere with focusing. Find or create a sacred place to chant. Experiment with different times of the day. Use candles or incense to enhance the ceremonial atmosphere. An ancient Hindu technique suggests repeating a mantra in 108 successions for 40 days to secure the mantras vibration in the body. if any if the days are missed it is important to start again at the beginning of the 40 day period.\nMuch has been written about the power of thought on action. A mantra is devotional and, therefore, inspired. Each mantra has a specific purpose to serve a higher ideal. If the intention serves this ideal and the universe, a profound and positive change can occur within the individual.\nMagical, healing mantras by Namaste is a collection of mantra kirtans, which simply means mantras accompanied by music.\nThe power of a verbalized mantra is in it&amp;#039;s vibration, which has a profound effect on the body. When a mantra is sung, as is intended, it becomes a chant. Chanting facilitates meditation because it opens the heart and quiets the mind. It is always devotional singing. The three most common kinds of chanting are: Kirtan, a repetitive call and response singing; bhajan, poems to god that are said to music and written by realized beings; and concert, which is like any other musical concert but the instruments are indian and the words are often in sanskrit.\nNew Earth Records Magical Healing Mantras by Namaste is a brilliant collection of seven mantras. Each mantra is recorded five to ten minutes in length. Twenty two vocalists accompany seven instrumental musicians. Guitars, flutes, sitars, tablas and a tarang are the instruments used to create a memorable Eastern and Western fusion sound that is, at once, exotic and familiar. The sound of the voices and the instrumental music flow together like the current of a river opening into the sea. The singers maintain a beautiful and sometimes haunting clarity while harmonizing seamlessly with the instrumental music. Though the lyrics are in sanskrit, the music cannot be defined or even characterized by any one culture. It is a true collaboration of individuals consciously choosing to unite as an eclectic group to serve a single intent.\nThe most important information to remember is that weather you choose to sing along or simply listen, the inherent healing power released by these mantras is unconditional and highly contagious.\n\nEnjoy It!\nUlysses56","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76b6034a6e780fcb45c0f8852855031477acd3ce","amp;dn":"NAMAST%C3%89+-+Magical+Healing+Mantras","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76b6034a6e780fcb45c0f8852855031477acd3ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,182,3,74,110,120,15,203,69,192,248,133,40,85,3,20,119,172,211,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
