However,the new member, Mi Nam, had to go to the States to repair a botched eye job just before signing the contract. His agent came up with\nthe idea of having his twin sister, Mi Nyu,to stand in for him and pretend that she was her brother. The two of them grew up in an orphanage and Mi Nyu, who was all set to become a nun, agreed to this\ncharade as she didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to spoil her brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chance of fame which would make it easier to look for their mother.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:faf833ddcaba7bda143867b894d0e4465a00504f","amp;dn":"You%27re+Beautiful+%28K-Drama%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"faf833ddcaba7bda143867b894d0e4465a00504f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,248,51,221,202,186,123,218,20,56,103,184,148,208,228,70,90,0,80,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
