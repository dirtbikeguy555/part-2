Author Jon Peck shows how to build a magazine cataloging system while describing how to use a MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework like CodeIgniter.\n\nStarting with the what and why of CodeIgniter, Jon introduces key concepts such as the MVC pattern and libraries by demonstrating how to create static pages, then storing and displaying magazine info in a database. Advanced topics like classes and helpers are explored to validate user input, upload files, and much more. By creating a complete system, you'll have the foundation to build your own applications with CodeIgniter.\nTopics include:\n\n    What is CodeIgniter?\n    Creating a static page controller\n    Generating output with a view\n    What is a model?\n    Saving data with Active Records\n    Creating forms\n    Validating user input\n    Listing records in tables\n    Uploading images\n    Viewing and deleting records\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7193cf121165670f8c4edc3c2df6270f51d2d00a","amp;dn":"Lynda.com-Up+and+Running+with+PHP+CodeIgniter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7193cf121165670f8c4edc3c2df6270f51d2d00a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,147,207,18,17,101,103,15,140,78,220,60,45,246,39,15,81,210,208,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
