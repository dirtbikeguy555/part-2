DanteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s theme is universal; it involves the greatest concepts that man has ever attained. Only a genius could have found the loftiness of tone and the splendor and variety of images that are presented in The Divine Comedy.\n\nThe story is an allegory representing the soulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s journey from spiritual depths to spiritual heights. As mankind exposes itself, by its merits or demerits, to the rewards or the punishments of justice, it experiences Ã¢â‚¬Å“InfernoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or hell, Ã¢â‚¬Å“PurgatorioÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or purgatory, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“ParadisoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or heaven, a vision of a world of beauty, light, and song. A single listening will reveal the power of Dante's imagination to make the spiritual visible.\n\nIn this edition, &quot;Inferno&quot; is translated by John Aitken Carlyle, &quot;Purgatorio,&quot; by Thomas Okey, and &quot;Paradiso&quot; by Philip H. Wicksteed.\n\n\nREVIEWS\n\n&quot;A modern reader, uninformed, could peruse the whole Commedia, satisfied with the mere literal story and entranced by its unparalleled beauty of language and imagery, but he would miss the inspiration of that higher message which so clearly merits the name of divine.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€œÃ¢â‚¬â€œC. H. Grandgent\n\n\nDANTE ALIGHIERI (1265-1321), one of the greatest poets in the Italian language, was born in Florence and later banished from there for his political activities. His philosophical-political poem Commedia, later called Divina Commedia, is considered a masterpiece of world literature.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62d7c891dc1b246ec81a31b2b2f4d287be584395","amp;dn":"Dante+Alighieri+-+The+Divine+Comedy+%28Audibook%2C+PDF%2C+TTC+Lectures","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62d7c891dc1b246ec81a31b2b2f4d287be584395","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,215,200,145,220,27,36,110,200,26,49,178,178,244,210,135,190,88,67,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
