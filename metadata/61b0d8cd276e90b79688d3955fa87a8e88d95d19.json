It is a double album which was released on 24 February 1975. Recording sessions for the album were initially disrupted when John Paul Jones considered leaving the band. After reuniting at Headley Grange, the band wrote and recorded eight songs, the combined length of which stretched the album beyond the typical length of an LP. This prompted the band to make Physical Graffiti a double album by including previously unreleased tracks from earlier recording sessions.\n\nPhysical Graffiti was commercially and critically successful; the album is 16 times platinum (though this signifies sales of 8 million copies, as it is a double album) in the United States alone, and has come to be regarded as one of Led Zeppelin's defining works. The album is ranked highly on several prominent best album or best rock album lists of all time.\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,\nHHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality\nof the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n     CD1\n\n01.Custard pie                                          [04:16]\n02.The rover                                            [05:39]\n03.In my time of dying                                  [11:04]\n04.Houses of the holy                                   [04:04]\n05.Trampled under foot                                  [05:38]\n06.Kashmir                                              [08:33]\n\n     CD2\n\n01.In the light                                         [08:50]\n02.Bron-Yr-aur                                          [02:07]\n03.Down by the seaside                                  [05:17]\n04.Ten years gone                                       [06:35]\n05.Night flight                                         [03:38]\n06.The wanton song                                      [04:10]\n07.Boogie with stu                                      [03:53]\n08.Black country woman                                  [04:33]\n09.Sick again                                           [04:44]\n____\n\n83:01 min\n120,5 MB\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61b0d8cd276e90b79688d3955fa87a8e88d95d19","amp;dn":"Led_Zeppelin-Physical_Graffiti-2CD-%28Retail%29-1975-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61b0d8cd276e90b79688d3955fa87a8e88d95d19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,176,216,205,39,110,144,183,150,136,211,149,95,168,122,142,136,217,93,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
