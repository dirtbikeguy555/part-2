Alien Skin Software has released a steady stream of highly regarded tools for photographers and graphic designers. We distill advanced math and cutting edge research into simple tools that render beautiful pictures. This plug-ins bundle contains their all newly update graphic softwares, which are Blow Up, Bokeh, Exposure, Eye Candy, Snap Art, that are able to work on Windows platform.\r\n\r\nAlien Skin Exposure for Photoshop\r\nExposure helps you visually explore carefully designed looks, reducing the need to fiddle with techy controls. The redesigned user interface in Exposure 5 reduces distraction and provides new ways to quickly find your style. There is a much wider range of textures and new controls to subtly combine them. Exposure works everywhere you do, now with Aperture support and as a stand-alone application that provides easy batch processing.\r\n\r\nAlien Skin Eye Candy for Photoshop\r\nEye Candy 7 renders realistic effects that are difficult or impossible to achieve in Photoshop alone, such as Fire, Chrome, and the new Lightning. Effects like Animal Fur, Smoke, and Reptile Skin are rendered in exquisite detail down to individual hairs, turbulent wisps, and shiny scales. Eye Candy helps you quickly explore and design looks. In Eye Candy 7, effects are chosen through easy to recognize icons rather than text menus. Presets are rapidly previewed by simply mousing over them. The theme is less clicking and more visual browsing.\r\n\r\nAlien Skin Blow Up for Photoshop\r\nBlow Up keeps photos crystal clear during enlargement. Especially in large prints hung on a wall, the difference between Blow Up and Photoshop is astounding. Version 3 makes pictures even sharper without computer artifacts. If you understand Photoshopâ€™s resize command then you already know how to use Blow Up. Our large library of standard paper sizes makes it even easier. With Lightroom and CMYK support, Blow Up fits into a professional workflow.\r\n\r\nAlien Skin Snap Art for Photoshop\r\nSnap Art turns your photograph into a beautiful work of art that looks completely handmade. Improved realism in version 3 keeps your subject natural and recognizable. The result is a finished piece worthy of printing on canvas and hanging in a gallery. Using Snap Art just requires a creative idea, not hand-eye coordination or technical training. Simply choose from hundreds of styles such as oil paint, watercolor, pencil sketch, or the new crayon. If you need more control, the new detail mask letâ€™s you quickly mark areas where you want the subject to be clearer.\r\n\r\nAlien Skin Bokeh for Photoshop\r\nBokeh 2 provides a wide range of creative focus effects and accurate lens simulation in a simple interface. Photographers use Bokeh to draw attention to their subject by manipulating focus, vignette, and depth of field. Bokeh gives you the visual language of specialized lenses without the expense or hassle. Just drop a focus region over your subject and choose a preset or easily craft your own look.\r\n\r\nIncluded Plug-ins:\r\nâ€¢ Exposure X Bundle 1.0.0.264 Revision 33148 (New)\r\nâ€¢ Blow Up 3.1.0.112 Revision 33176 (New)\r\nâ€¢ Exposure X 1.1.0.2223 Revision 33178\r\nâ€¢ Snap Art 4.1.0.103 Revision 33177\r\nâ€¢ Eye Candy 7.1.0.1203 Revision 26388\r\n\r\nHost Requirements\r\nExposure X may be used as a standalone program or a plug-in.
