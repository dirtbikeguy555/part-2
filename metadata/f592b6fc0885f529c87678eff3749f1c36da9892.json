As conflicts continue to proliferate around the globe, the perception of a colossal, unyielding, and unavoidable struggle between Islam and the West has intensified. These numerous conflicts, both actual and ideological, have revived fears of an ongoing &quot;clash of civilizations&quot; â€• an intractable and irreconcilable conflict of values between Western cultures and an Islam that is portrayed as hostile and alien.\r\n\r\nThe New Crusades takes head-on the idea of an emergent &quot;Cold War&quot; between Islam and the West. It explores the historical, political, and institutional forces that have raised the specter of a threatening and monolithic Muslim enemy and provides a nuanced critique of much received wisdom on the topic, particularly the &quot;clash of civilizations&quot; theory. Bringing together twelve of the most influential thinkers in Middle Eastern and religious studies â€• including Edward Said, Roy Mottahedeh, and Fatema Mernissi â€• this timely collection confronts such depictions of the Arab-Islamic world, showing their inner workings and how they both empower and shield from scrutiny Islamic radicals who operate from similar paradigms of inevitable and absolute conflict","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f592b6fc0885f529c87678eff3749f1c36da9892","amp;dn":"The+New+Crusades%3A+Constructing+the+Muslim+Enemy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f592b6fc0885f529c87678eff3749f1c36da9892","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,146,182,252,8,133,245,41,200,118,120,239,243,116,159,28,54,218,152,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
