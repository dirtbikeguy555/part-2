But these Capitol recordings show the bandleader at the height of his artistry; it's a trip well worth the steep price for Prima completists. Eight CDs document the classic &quot;jump, jive, and wail&quot; that made Prima a lounge icon. One CD is devoted exclusively to his live work. Keely Smith (Prima's best-known singing companion/wife) and Sam Butera (Prima's long-time arranger/saxophonist) are both represented here, with two CDs each. The liner notes, as with all Bear Family box sets, are intelligent, profuse, and well-researched. The collection is really more Prima than you probably ever wanted, but for parties, it can't be beat. --Jason Verlinde\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img299.imageshack.us/img299/2127/prima.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img299.imageshack.us/img299/2127/prima.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\nCD1\n01 Buona Sera\n02 Oh Marie!\n03 Just A GigoloI Ain't Got Nobody\n04 Body And Soul\n05 Jump, Jive, An' Wail\n06 (Nothing's Too Good) For My Baby\n07 I'll Be Glad When You're Dead You Rascal You\n08 Basin Street BluesWhen It's Sleepy Time Down South\n09 Night Train\n10 The Lip\n11 Whistle Stop\n12 Five Months, Two Weeks, Two Days\n13 Banana Split For My Baby\n14 Be Mine (Little Baby)\n15 When You're SmilingSheik of Araby\n16 The Birth Of The Blues\n17 Blow, Red Blow\n18 When The Saints Go Marching In\n19 Sentimental Journey\n20 There'll Be No Next Time\n21 The Closer To The Bone\n22 I've Got The World On A String\n23 Much Too Young To Loose My Mind\n24 Don't Let A Memory\n25 Pennies From Heaven\n26 Baby Won't You Please Come Home\n27 Autumn Leaves\n\nCD2\n01 The Pump Song\n02 The Boulevard Of Broken Dreams\n03 Natural Buy\n04 Beep!
