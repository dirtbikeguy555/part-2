In an age of overly polite debate bending over backward to reach a happy consensus within an increasingly centrist political dialogue, Hitchens pointedly pitches himself in contrast. He bemoans the loss of the skills of dialectical thinking evident in contemporary society. He understands the importance of disagreement - to personal integrity, to informed discussion, to true progress - heck, to democracy itself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:623dca2614590a07ed4b488469f5bf5ba3876d6f","amp;dn":"Christopher+Hitchens+-+Letters+to+a+Young+Contrarian+%5BUnabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"623dca2614590a07ed4b488469f5bf5ba3876d6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,61,202,38,20,89,10,7,237,75,72,132,105,245,191,91,163,135,109,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
