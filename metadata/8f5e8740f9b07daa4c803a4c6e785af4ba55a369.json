Yet for many, China's history remains unknown, or known only through the stylized images that generations in the West have cherished or reviled as truth. \n\nWith his command of character and event -- the product of thirty years of research and reflection in the field -- Spence dispels those myths in a powerful narrative. Over four centuries of Chinese history, from the waning days of the once-glorious Ming Dynasty to Deng Xiaoping's bloody suppression of the pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, Spence fashions the astonishing story of the effort to achieve a modern China. Through the ideas and emotions of its reformist Confucian scholars, its poets, novelists, artists, and visionary students, we see one of the world's oldest cultures struggling to define itself as Chinese and modern.\n\nAudio Cassette\nPublisher: Blackstone Audio, Inc.; Unabridged LIBRARY (part 1 of 2 parts) edition (August 1, 1997)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0786102217\nISBN-13: 978-0786102211\n\nRead by Frederick Davidson \nFormat: MP3 \nBitrate: 64 Kbps \nUnabridged \n\n\nCome &amp; Join Suprbay; Post Requests, Suggestions &amp; Surf the TPB Forum. \n\n                                               &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/index.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/index.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\n__________________\n\n\nAnd, My Link On Suprbay:\n                                               &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Thread-Promising-ebooks-Audio-Books-Torrents-by-The-Abee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Thread-Promising-ebooks-Audio-Books-Torrents-by-The-Abee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGet me there. :)\n\n\n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n\n\n\n                                                     :)__Abee","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f5e8740f9b07daa4c803a4c6e785af4ba55a369","amp;dn":"The+Search+for+Modern+China+%5B64%5D+by+Jonathan+D.+Spence+ABEE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f5e8740f9b07daa4c803a4c6e785af4ba55a369","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,94,135,64,249,176,125,170,76,128,58,76,110,120,90,244,186,85,163,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
