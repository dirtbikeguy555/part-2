Palin's Joe Sixpack - who she actually doesn't give a toss about (apart from his or her vote, of course) often goes without and that's just fine in corporate-controlled anti-social America. At the same time, many Americans brainwashed by the corporate media and influenced by vain patriotism still believe that America's medieval health system is the best in the world while millions of Americans can't afford to see a doctor causing widespread untreated disease in 'the free world'. Universal health care or vaguely compassionate legislation to change this sorry state of affairs is immediately decried as 'socialist' or even 'terrorist' by America's money-grabbing corporate fascists.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5323c142284ac5af1b5473e0b93dde95327b1d99","amp;dn":"Sicko+by+Michael+Moore","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5323c142284ac5af1b5473e0b93dde95327b1d99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,35,193,66,40,74,197,175,27,84,115,224,185,61,222,149,50,123,29,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
