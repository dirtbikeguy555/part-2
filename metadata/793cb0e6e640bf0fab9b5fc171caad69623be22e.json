The path they can pursue with a love and true passion.\n\nRobert showcases success stories of &quot;C Students&quot; who grew up to be phenomenal successes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and HIRED those &quot;A Students&quot;(attorneys, accountants, and other school-smart specialists) to work in their businesses... while the more average students, &quot;B Students,&quot; often find themselves in government-type jobs...\n\nNot surprisingly, Kiyosaki will coin his own definitions of what &quot;A,&quot; &quot;B,&quot; and &quot;C&quot; stand for as he gives parents and their children bits of wisdom as well as insights and tools for navigating an ever-changing world... an Information Age world where the ability to change and adapt, understand relationships, and anticipate the future will shape their lives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:793cb0e6e640bf0fab9b5fc171caad69623be22e","amp;dn":"Why+A+Students+Work+for+C+Students+-+Robert+Kiyosaki.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"793cb0e6e640bf0fab9b5fc171caad69623be22e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,60,176,230,230,64,191,15,171,155,95,193,113,202,173,105,98,59,226,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
