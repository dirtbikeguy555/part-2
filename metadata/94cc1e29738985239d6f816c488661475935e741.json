RYAN ....\n\n\nPLOT:\n\n\nBobby Eroica Dupea (Jack Nicholson) comes from a well-bred family of musicians, and once showed great promise as a concert pianist. By nature a restless, angry individual, Bobby left his family and his music when he could no longer endure the dull, cloistered routine of daily practice. He took to the road, wanting to &quot;see the world,&quot; and hopefully find something or someone to quell his inner turmoil. He has settled in a small town as an oil rigger, where his life consists of going to work, arguing with his dimwitted but loving girlfriend Rayette (Karen Black), and bowling every night with his friend Elton (Billy &quot;Green&quot; Bush). Not surprisingly, this routine begins to disgust Bobby and, fed up, he decides to travel to Puget Sound, Washington to pay his family a visit. Leaving Rayette at a nearby motel, Bobby goes home and is reunited with his family.\n\n\nTAGLINE: He Rode The Fast Lane On The Road To Nowhere. \n\n\nAll stand-alone divx players compatible\n\n\nENJOY &amp; PLEASE SEED FOR AS LONG AS U CAN !!!!\n\n\nALSO IF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS DON'T HESITATE TO ASK.
