The reader learns about the foibles and quirks as well as the admirable ingenuity and impressive accomplishments of famous scientists who made some of the greatest discoveries of the past and present.\r\n\r\nExamples abound: James Watson and Francis Crick formed a legendary partnership that led to the discovery of DNA, but they essentially ignored the contribution of female colleague Rosalind Franklin. Later, in the race to sequence the human genome, Watson criticized J. Craig Venter s technique as a process that could be run by monkeys. Nikola Tesla once worked for Thomas Edison, but then quit after a dispute about a bonus. Robert Hooke accused Isaac Newton of stealing his ideas about optics. Plato declared that the works of Democritus should be burned. \r\n\r\nWith tongue-in-cheek illustrations by renowned science cartoonist Sidney Harris, this book takes the reader behind the scenes of scientific research to shine new light on the all-too-human people who do science","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f12ba3072bd9e8cd67efbd7193f1ca59882544f0","amp;dn":"The+Human+Side+of+Science+%282016%29+%28Epub%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f12ba3072bd9e8cd67efbd7193f1ca59882544f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,43,163,7,43,217,232,205,103,239,189,113,147,241,202,89,136,37,68,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
