He continues to work tirelessly to promote conscious food choices more than 20 years later. \n\nFirst published in 2001, The Food Revolution is still one of the most frequently cited and talked about books of the food-politics revolution. It was one of the very first books to discuss the negative health effects of eating genetically modified foods and animal products of all kinds, to expose the dangers inherent in our factory farming system, and to advocate a complete plant-based diet. \n\nThe book garnered endorsements by everyone from Paul Hawken to Neal Donald Walsch, Marianne Williamson to Julia Butterfly Hill. After ten years in print, The Food Revolution is timelier than ever--and a very compelling read. The 10th anniversary edition has an updated, new contemporary look and a new introduction by the author.\n\nFrom Publishers Weekly\n\nGroomed to succeed his late father (cofounder of the world's largest ice cream company, Baskin-Robbins), bestselling author Robbins (Diet for a New America) chose to walk away from ice cream earnings for a &quot;deeper dream,&quot; staying true to his belief in health and environment over corporate profit margins. Now chairman and director of several nonprofit organizations, Robbins offers compelling evidence to support his plant-based diet. Appalled by the proliferation of high-protein, fad diet books, he advocates eating locally, organically grown fruits and vegetables, incorporating whole grains and drinking lots of water while avoiding animal products and processed, refined and fatty foods. Divided into five ambiguously named parts (&quot;Our Food, Our World&quot;; &quot;Our Food, Our Future&quot;), this work nimbly covers such diverse topics as agricultural chemical pollution, the diet/disease connection, genetic engineering and inhumane corporate farming practices, while maintaining a conversational, nonjudgmental tone. Robbins's experience as a speaker and his use of personal anecdotes and persuasive arguments are complemented by several professional readers who frequently interject relevant statistics, information and research, both pro and con, including sometimes sarcastically read statements from the Cattlemen's Association, which will leave listeners thinking twice before picking up their next hamburger. Based on the Conari Press paperback (Forecasts, May 21).\n\nFrom Library Journal\n\nRobbins, author of the classic Diet for a New America, believes that plant-based nutrition and particularly vegan diets (free of meat, milk, and eggs) lead to long life and good health. Citing statistics, research studies, and selected quotes that extol the benefits of such diets, he also argues that animal products are responsible for such diseases as obesity, heart disease, high blood pressure, and cancer. Robbins deplores the inadequate sanitation and inspection in meat-processing plants and argues that many of the illnesses and stomach ailments that people complain about result from animal agriculture and the pathogens it introduces into our bodies. He also raises concerns about the dangers of fad diets that advocate high carbohydrates, high protein, or high fat. Robbins's zealous advocacy of plant-based nutrition and his refusal to consider the need for animal products in human nutrition throws his book off balance. Nevertheless, those who want to know more about vegan diets will gain many insights from his provocative book. Recommended for large nutrition collections with a diversity of viewpoints.
