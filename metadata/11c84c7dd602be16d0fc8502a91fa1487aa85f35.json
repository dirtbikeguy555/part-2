It stands in the corner of a dead end surrounded by dead trees and mangy strays of all kinds. There, lies their dream; In each graceless poster covering the walls, in the stained carpet beneath their feet, in the empty cases of Pabst that jingle to the vibration of their melodies. They are The Glorious Sons, a Canadian rock band, defined by their music and inspired by the day to day grind. They are the everyman band, with a passion for portraying the lost romance of liquor, women and rock and roll.\n\nTrack Listing\n1. White Noise\n2. Mama\n3. Shapeless Art\n4. Caroline\n5. Baby\n6.
