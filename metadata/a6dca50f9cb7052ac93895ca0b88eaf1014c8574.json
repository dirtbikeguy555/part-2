HERE IS A CRACKED VERSION FOR YOU!\n\nOr maybe you just want your privacy.\n\nThis cracked Mod Manager will not force you to log in. \nUPDATE: HOORAY!! NEXUS SITE SAW THAT I HAVE CRACKED THIS AND GOTTEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOWNLOADS, STOLEN FROM THEM! THEY SEE THAT EVEN BANNED MEMBERS STILL HAVE ACCESS, SO THEY LOSE THEIR POWER!! THEY HAVE SUBMITTED TO US!! NOW THERE IS AN &quot;OFFLINE MODE&quot; IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO CRACK IT!!!\n\nHowever, seeing as the following things, you still do want to crack it:\n1) They still do not let members who are banned be able to download mods. So we must use the cracked version to defy them until they submit further!\n2) If you are banned from the Nexus site, you still have to login to download! This means you can't get new versions if you are banned! Scum.\n\nBUT HOORAY FOR THE FIRST GREAT VICTORY OVER THE NEXUS MODS SITE!! LET'S CONTINUE TO DEFY THE SELF-DECLARED NEXUS LORDS AND REMOVE THEM FROM THEIR FALSE THRONE!!! LET'S FORCE THEM TO SUBMIT TO US FURTHER!!!\n\nBased off the latest 0.44.8 version of the Nexus Mod Manager in April of 2013.\n\nFOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY, AND IN ORDER.\n\n=======================================================\n\nSTEP 1:\n\ta) Open Mod_Manager_Cracked_0.44.8.zip \n\t(NOTE: Why zipped? Faster downloads, and less likely for file corruption. Also if you ever get your copy corrupted, then it's easy to restore to a working copy of the program by just unzipping the folder and overwriting all.)\n\n\tb) Copy &quot;Mod Manager 0.44.8&quot; folder to C:/Program Files/\n\nSTEP 2:\n    When it asks you to log in, choose &quot;OFFLINE MODE&quot;. You don't even need to be connected to the internet!\n\nSTEP 3:\n    SUCCESS!\n\n=======================================================\n\nNOTES:\n\nHow do I crack the program?\n\tAlready cracked!\n\t\nWhat does crack do for me / Why is it cracked?\n\t1) If you're banned from the site, now you can use the application by downloading this torrent.\n\t2) You can use the program without being logged in.\n\t3) More security for you.\n\t4) Peace of mind.\n\t5) PORTABLE means no install required! Better for you.\n\t\nCan I update mods? \n\tYES. Just not through the Mod Manager if in OFFLINE MODE.\n\tIf you do have a login, it will work!\n\nCan I update the Mod Manager? \n\tYes!\n\nWill it ever try to access the Nexus Forums? \n\tNot if you're in OFFLINE MODE!\n\nDo I have to disconnect from the internet?\n\tNope!\n\nWhere do my new mods go?\n\tPut your new mods in C:/Games/Skyrim/mods\n\tYou can also change the directory in Settings.\n\nHow do I download mods?\n\tDownload through ThePirateBay.se or KAT or through H33T, or if you want the latest versions, either check my torrents to find the latest updates, or download from a friend's computer then copy to your computer.\n\n=======================================================\n\nCHANGELOG\n\nCurrent Build - 0.44.8\n \nAdded Features:\n\tNone\n\nBug Fixes:\n\n0.44.8\n\tCrash caused by duplicate entries in the Install Log file. (the dreaded &quot;an item with the same key has already been added&quot; crash).\n\tUninstalling a plugin caused the program to remove it from the plugin list even if a previous version was restored.\n\tA readonly check preventing the program from restoring a previous file version if the file to restore was set to readonly.\n\tThe mod manager will now automatically uninstall a mod whose mod archive is missing instead of crashing the program.\n\tDeleting a mod while having multiple mods selected also removed all the selected mods from the list even though the mod deletion method only works on a single mods.\n\tRare crash with the saved column sorting.\n\tBug that prevented the program from obtaining updated mod info from a new version of the mod archive.\n\t\n=======================================================\n\nBe sure to check out my other uploads!  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/-xbt-/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/-xbt-/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6dca50f9cb7052ac93895ca0b88eaf1014c8574","amp;dn":"-XBT-+Cracked+Nexus+Mod+Manager+-+Skyrim%2C+Etc+v0.44.8+PORTABLE%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6dca50f9cb7052ac93895ca0b88eaf1014c8574","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,220,165,15,156,183,5,42,201,56,149,202,11,136,234,241,1,76,133,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
