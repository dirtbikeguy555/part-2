In The Domesticated Brain, renowned psychologist Bruce Hood explores the relationship between the brain and social behaviour, looking for clues as to origins and operations of the mechanisms that keep us bound together. How do our brains enable us to live together, to raise children, and to learn and pass on information and culture? Combining social psychology with neuroscience, Hood provides an essential introduction to the hidden operations of the brain, and explores what makes us who we are.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a97ff08defbd1c6e934391bbb53f2c483ef56170","amp;dn":"The+Domesticated+Brain+%282014%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a97ff08defbd1c6e934391bbb53f2c483ef56170","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,127,240,141,239,189,28,110,147,67,145,187,181,63,44,72,62,245,97,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
