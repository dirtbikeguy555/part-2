Queen Raesinia of Vordan is anxious to see the return of peace, but Janus insists that any peace with the implacable Sworn Church of Elysium is doomed to fail. For their Priests of the Black, there can be no truce with heretics and demons they seek to destroy, and the war is to the death.\r\n\r\nSoldiers Marcus dÃ¢Â€â„¢Ivoire and Winter Ihernglass find themselves caught between their general and their queen. Now, each must decide which leader truly commands their loyaltyâ€”and what price they might pay for final victory.\r\n\r\nAnd in the depths of Elysium, a malign force is risingâ€”and defeating it might mean making sacrifices beyond anything they have ever imagined.\r\n\r\n=======================================\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/shtihl22\r\n\r\n=======================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9514f4a809a22b4e778c724730aa69951b35ae3d","amp;dn":"The+Guns+of+Empire+%28The+Shadow+Campaigns%29+%28Django+Wexler%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9514f4a809a22b4e778c724730aa69951b35ae3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,20,244,168,9,162,43,78,119,140,114,71,48,170,105,149,27,53,174,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
