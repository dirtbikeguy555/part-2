The album was recorded at Le Studio, Morin Heights, Quebec, and was mixed at Trident Studios in London, UK. Permanent Waves became Rush's first US Top 5 album hitting #4 and was the band's fifth Gold (eventually Platinum) selling album. The album also marks a distinct transition from long, conceptual pieces, into a more accessible, radio-friendly style and consequently, a significant expansion in the band's sales with hits such as &quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot; and &quot;Freewill&quot; seeing considerable radio airplay.\n\nTrack Listing [Remastered] [320k MP3]\n\n1. \t&quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot;   \t4:57\n2. \t&quot;Freewill&quot;   \t5:24\n3. \t&quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot;   \t7:26\n4. \t&quot;Entre Nous&quot;   \t4:36\n5. \t&quot;Different Strings&quot; (Geddy Lee) \t3:48\n6. \t&quot;Natural Science\n    I: Tide Pools - 2:19 (0:00 - 2:19)\n    II: Hyperspace - 2:48 (2:20 - 5:07)\n    III: Permanent Waves - 4:10 (5:08 - 9:17)&quot;  \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f861f486a744d508bcc75bc0115d93f1c8b5023","amp;dn":"Rush+-+Permanent+Waves+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f861f486a744d508bcc75bc0115d93f1c8b5023","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,134,31,72,106,116,77,80,139,204,117,188,1,21,217,63,28,139,80,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
