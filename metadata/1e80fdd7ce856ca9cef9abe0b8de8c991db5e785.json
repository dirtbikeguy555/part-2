There is only one problem... their bikes are not. Dave has a surprise for Si - a post-war Ural motorbike (complete with sidecar) and the very first bike Dave owned. We see the boys' preconceptions of this country challenged as they spend a night backstage at the ballet courtesy of one of Russia's most powerful oligarchs, become a walking history lesson courtesy of St Petersburg's biggest fashion designers, immerse themselves in Soviet culture and cook for everyday Russians in their dacha (or country house).\n\nSi and Dave taste some of Russia's finest foods (washed down with a vodka) and go down the rabbit hole of a country and culture we know very little about. What will they think of modern Russia when they come out the other side?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e80fdd7ce856ca9cef9abe0b8de8c991db5e785","amp;dn":"The.Hairy.Bikers-Northern.Exposure-S01E03-Russia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e80fdd7ce856ca9cef9abe0b8de8c991db5e785","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,128,253,215,206,133,108,169,206,249,171,224,184,222,140,153,29,181,231,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
