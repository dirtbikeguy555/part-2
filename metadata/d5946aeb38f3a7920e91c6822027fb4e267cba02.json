With no willpower, no withdrawal and no weight gain. In addition to finding it easy, quitting smoking can be one of the most enjoyable and empowering experiences of your life.\n\nThis sounds too good to be true, but take a look at some our testimonials. Do you see these kinds of testimonials on websites selling the patch or gum? Easyway is not hypnosis or reverse brainwashing. It is simple cognitive therapy. It is based on the principle that over the years of smoking we develop distorted thinking about what the cigarette does for us. For example, we tell ourselves that smoking relaxes us, helps us handle stress, relieves boredom etc. But if this were genuinely true then smokers would be more relaxed, less stressed and less bored than non-smokers. Hmmm.\n\nThe Easyway method demonstrates that these perceived benefits are in fact illusions. Yes, they are powerful and subtle illusions, but illusions nevertheless. If we smoke to relieve boredom, for instance, then why do we also smoke when we arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t bored? And why donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t non-smokers, who have the same stresses and strains as smokers, need a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“crutchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ to get through life?\n\nBy demonstrating that there are no genuine benefits of smoking (letÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s face it, if there were, it would say it on the pack) we can see that our perceived desire to smoke is rooted in these false beliefs. Once we remove these false beliefs and replace them with more positive and empowering ones, the desire to smoke is eliminated. With no desire to smoke there is no need for willpower (willpower is only needed if you have a desire to do something but wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t let yourself). With no willpower there is no conflict. With no conflict there is no fear, no panic, no anxiety or many of the other symptoms associated with quitting. This is why former smokers quitting using this method christened it ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“EasywayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThis DVD contains all the information you need to quit smoking, see the DVD with an open mind, concentrated and follow the instrucitons at the end of the DVD and you will quit in 60 minutes!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5946aeb38f3a7920e91c6822027fb4e267cba02","amp;dn":"Allen+Carr+-+Easyway+to+Stop+Smoking.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5946aeb38f3a7920e91c6822027fb4e267cba02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,148,106,235,56,243,167,146,14,145,198,130,32,39,251,78,38,124,186,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
