Today, street art has traveled to nearly every corner of the globe, evolving into a highly complex and ornate art form. The World Atlas of Street Art and Graffiti is the definitive survey of international street art, focusing on the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most influential urban artists and artworks. Since the lives and works of urban artists are inextricably linked to specific streets and places, this beautifully illustrated volume features specially commissioned Ã¢â‚¬Å“city artworksÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that provide an intimate understanding of these metropolitan landscapes.\n\nOrganized geographically by country and city, more than 100 of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most important street artistsÃ¢â‚¬â€including Espo in New York, Shepard Fairey in Los Angeles, Os GÃƒÂªmeos in Brazil, and Anthony Lister in AustraliaÃ¢â‚¬â€are profiled alongside key examples of their work. The evolution of street art and graffiti within each region is also chronicled, providing essential historical context. With contributions by the foremost authorities on street art and graffiti, this landmark publication provides a nuanced understanding of a widespread contemporary art practice. The World Atlas of Street Art and Graffiti emphasizes urban artÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powerful commitment to a spontaneous creativity that is inherently connected to the architecture of the metropolis.\n\n\n\n\nimage\nScientia est potentia\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abc66d5215dcb3cf2cb706db592f6691ecd2da5a","amp;dn":"The+World+Atlas+of+Street+Art+and+Graffiti+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abc66d5215dcb3cf2cb706db592f6691ecd2da5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,198,109,82,21,220,179,207,44,183,6,219,89,47,102,145,236,210,218,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
