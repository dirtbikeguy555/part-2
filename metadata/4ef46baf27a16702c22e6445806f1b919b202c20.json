The sound on this release blows all previous versions away, it is untouchable, the sharpness and crispness is simply superb. San Francisco in April 1969 is the stuff of legends, their playing was on fire, and they will always be held in the highest esteem by fans. Hope they have as much love for the 320ak mp3 version\r\n\r\nCD 1:\r\n\r\n1. Tuneups\r\n2. As Long As I Have You\r\n3. Killing Floor\r\n4. White Summer/Black Mountain Side\r\n5.
