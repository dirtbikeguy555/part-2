Hall\n\nDexter Morgan is a Miami blood spatter expert with a dark secret. He kills people who deserve to die. His foster father Harry taught him how to pick his victims and leave no tracks. Dexter calls this the Code of Harry. A very important part of &quot;the Code&quot; is to maintain the appearance of a good citizen, so Dexter tries very hard to look like a normal person, although in reality he is emotionless and bloodthirsty. The only person he cares about is his sister Debra, and maybe even his girlfriend Rita, whom he maintaines as part of his normal guy disguise. Even though Dexter is a heartless killer, he would never hurt a child, and he has good relations with Rita's kids.\n\nAs far as work goes, Dexter is on friends with Vince Masuoka and Angel Batista. Their boss, Lt. Maria Laguerta, eyeballs Dexter inbetween harming Debra's career. Sergeant Doakes is the only person who sees beyond Dexter's superfficial nature and suspects that he is someone else.\n\n\nimage\nGeneral\nFormat : Matroska\nFormat version : Version 4 / Version 2\nOverall bit rate : 1 394 Kbps\nEncoded date : UTC 2013-08-22 04:05:35\nWriting application : mkvmerge v6.2.0 ('Promised Land') built on Apr 28 2013 12:22:01\nWriting library : libebml v1.3.0 + libmatroska v1.4.0\n\nVideo\nID : 1\nFormat : AVC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;5a12333d321a166e746b&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 14 frames\nCodec ID : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nBit rate : 1 010 Kbps\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\nHeight : 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate mode : Constant\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.046\nWriting library : x264 core 136 r2348+704+51 d1baef6 tMod [8-bit@all X86]\nDefault : Yes\nForced : No\n\nAudio\nID : 2\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness : Big\nCodec ID : A_AC3\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 384 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 6 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nCompression mode : Lossy\nDefault : Yes\nForced : No\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d0af4d33a3e5f3c4e191a0a91b007e14c889739","amp;dn":"Dexter+Season+8+-+COMPLETE+720p+x264+%5BMKV%2CAC3%2C5.1%5D+Ehhhh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d0af4d33a3e5f3c4e191a0a91b007e14c889739","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,10,244,211,58,62,95,60,78,25,26,10,145,176,7,225,76,136,151,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
