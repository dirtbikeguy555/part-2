Yet there are strangely few resources on the topic in North America. Solar Water Heating fills this gap. It reviews the history of solar water and space heating systems from prehistory to the present, then presents the basics of solar water heating, including an introduction to modern solar energy systems, energy conservation and energy economics.\n\n\nBy Bob Ramlow, Benjamin Nusz\nPublished by New Society Publishers in 2009\nPDF, Retail, 288 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f9cd42c7d00441b56dae7e67af8950ad94427ed","amp;dn":"Solar+Water+Heating+%28PDF%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f9cd42c7d00441b56dae7e67af8950ad94427ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,156,212,44,125,0,68,27,86,218,231,230,122,248,149,10,217,68,39,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
