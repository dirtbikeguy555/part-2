Those who had the privilege of hearing him speak can attest to the elegance and common sense of his material. It is no coincidence, then, that he is widely regarded as one of the most influential thinkers of our time, and thought of by many as a national treasure. Jim authored countless books and audio and video programs, and helped motivate and shape an entire generation of personal-development trainers, hundreds of executives from America's top corporations and millions of achievers worldwide.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dde33eeb062da57af4e00cd42c78e7b8f179c50","amp;dn":"JIM+ROHN+-+HOW+TO+USE+A+JOURNAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dde33eeb062da57af4e00cd42c78e7b8f179c50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,222,51,238,176,98,218,87,175,78,0,205,66,199,142,123,143,23,156,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
