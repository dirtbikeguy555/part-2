For centuries, his name ranked among the most illustrious of the ancient world.\r\n\r\nConsidered by some a contemporary of Moses and a forerunner of Christ, this almost mythical figure arose in Alexandria during the fourth century B.C. from a fusion of the Egyptian god Thoth and the Greek god Hermes. Master of magic, writing, science, and philosophy, Hermes was thought to have walked with gods and to be the source of the divine wisdom granted to humankind at the dawn of time.\r\n\r\nGary Lachman has written many books exploring ancient traditions for the modern mind. In The Quest for Hermes Trismegistus, he brings to life the mysterious character of this great spiritual guide, exposing the many theories and stories surrounding him, and revitalizing his teachings for the modern world.\r\n\r\nThrough centuries of wars, conquests, and religious persecutions, the fragile pages of the teachings of Hermes Trismegistus have survived. This is a book for all thinkers and enquirers who want to recover that lost knowledge and awaken a shift in human consciousness","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70aaa2489fa54d38a46cf5281743542ff90a243c","amp;dn":"The+Quest+for+Hermes+Trismegistus%3A+From+Ancient+Egypt+to+...","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70aaa2489fa54d38a46cf5281743542ff90a243c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,170,162,72,159,165,77,56,164,108,245,40,23,67,84,47,249,10,36,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
