The great Malian guitarist came to London in the company of the kora star Toumani Diabate to give a concert and record what would be their final album together. Toure was seriously ill, but he was still on tremendous form ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ as can be judged from this album. It's a set that's remarkable both for the delicacy and composure of the playing, and the sheer variety. There are languid, blues-edged treatments of ancient songs, along with such surprises as the lilting, Cuban-influenced Sabu Yerkoy, on which Toure sings against a flurry of kora, and backing that includes his son Vieux on vocals and congas. This is a magnificent and poignant farewell.\n-- The Guardian\n\nAn album of spellbinding beauty.\n-- uncut (****)\n\nYou get the feel of two of the world's greatest musicians in a room together, having a conversation and creating a document that will carry their legacy into the future.\n-- Pitchfork\n\nBeautifully recorded, Ali &amp; Toumani lives up to and perhaps exceeds expectations.\n-- BBC\n\nAli and Toumani will certainly join the ranks of recordings that are &quot;beyond criticism.&quot;\n-- AllAboutJazz\n\nTracks\n01- Ruby\n02- Sabu Yerkoy\n03- Be Mankan\n04- Doudou\n05- Warbe\n06- Samba Geladio\n07- Sina Mory\n08- 56\n09- Fantasy\n10- Machengoidi\n11- Kala Djula\n\nArtwork, EAC log and CUE sheet included.\n\nAudio format: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!\n\nLegalise it!\n\nPastafari Cubensis &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou too can search for evidence the Flying Spaghetti Monster is the Lord and Master of the Universe  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://setiathome.berkeley.edu&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a023b4c6c7ad4e8dce2fb62a85428e963eddcc27","amp;dn":"Ali+Farka+Toure%2C+Toumani+Diabate+-+Ali+%26+Toumani+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a023b4c6c7ad4e8dce2fb62a85428e963eddcc27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,35,180,198,199,173,78,141,206,47,182,42,133,66,142,150,62,221,204,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
