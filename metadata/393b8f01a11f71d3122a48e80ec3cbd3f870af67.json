So if your looking for less quality go somewhere else.  (My files are the closest to the lossless source GUARANTEED)\n\nI Stand Behind My Bitrates and Authenticity... Enjoy and Seed\n\n==============================BITRATE TUTORIAL=================================\nBelow I will show you how to easily determine if an AAC or MP3 is truly 320 or just a re-encode...\n\nYou will need the torrent listed below to start then follow my steps... &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3883065/Adobe.Audition.v3.WinAll.Cracked-NoPE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3883065/Adobe.Audition.v3.WinAll.Cracked-NoPE&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n1. Open adobe audition and click on edit\n\n2. Drag and Drop (or add) the mp3/aac file into adobe audition (aac must be wav)\n\n3. Click on &quot;View&quot; and then Spectral Frequency Display (Shift+F)\n\n\nA true 320 source will be 20Hz or above..(JOINT STEREO WILL RESULT IN LOWER FREQUENCIES) (Lower Quality)\n\n128 Re-encodes or 192 re-encodes will be stuck @ 16Hz or 18Hz...\n\n\nNOTE: There is an exception for this rule; oldies,acoustics,piano songs,and low volume music Will have lower frequencies even if encoded with 320!\n=================================================================================\n\nWhat is normalization?  (-1db)\n\nThe Normalize effect amplifies the entire file or selection equally. For example, if the original audio reaches a loud peak of 80% and a quiet low of 20%, normalizing to 100% amplifies the loud peak to 100% and the quiet low to 40%.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:393b8f01a11f71d3122a48e80ec3cbd3f870af67","amp;dn":"M83+Ultimate+Discography+320+AAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"393b8f01a11f71d3122a48e80ec3cbd3f870af67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,59,143,1,161,31,113,211,18,42,72,232,14,195,203,211,248,112,175,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
