Y. F. Lau\n2011 \nEnglish\nISBN: 0470195096\n272 pages \nPDF \n11 MB\n\n\nThis book is about the basic principles that underlie critical thinking and creativity. The majority of the content is on critical thinking since more topics are naturally involved and since they can be discussed readily and systematically. The last few chapters are devoted to creativity and research methodology, not typical the bookÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s plethora of competition. Each chapter introduces a specific topic, usually by introducing the relevant theories in conjunction with realistic examples that show how the theories can be applied. \n\nEach chapter concludes with a set of exercises whose solutions are detailed at the rear of the book. While the writing style is purposefully informal, the presentation is complete, at least with respect to the intended introductory level.\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64a867890ef4e63b1b662fa67c3b2bf89dedb092","amp;dn":"An+Introduction+to+Critical+Thinking+and+Creativity%3A+Think+More%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64a867890ef4e63b1b662fa67c3b2bf89dedb092","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,168,103,137,14,244,230,59,27,102,47,166,124,59,43,248,157,237,176,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
