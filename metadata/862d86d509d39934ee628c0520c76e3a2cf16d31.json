It can focus on the art-making process as therapeutic in and of itself (&quot;art as therapy&quot;) or it can be Ã¢â‚¬Å“art in therapyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (art psychotherapy). The psychoanalytic approach was the earliest form of art psychotherapy. This approach employs the transference process between the therapist and the client who makes art. The therapist interprets the client's symbolic self-expression as communicated in the art and elicits interpretations from the client.[1] Analysis of transference is no longer always a component. Current art therapy includes a vast number of other approaches such as: Person-Centered, Cognitive, Behavior, Gestalt, Narrative, Adlerian, Family (Systems) and more. The tenets of art therapy involve humanism, creativity, reconciling emotional conflicts, fostering self-awareness, and personal growth.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:862d86d509d39934ee628c0520c76e3a2cf16d31","amp;dn":"Art+Therapy+Books+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"862d86d509d39934ee628c0520c76e3a2cf16d31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,45,134,213,9,211,153,52,238,98,140,5,32,199,110,58,44,241,109,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
