Dogs do not ritually urinate in the hope of persuading heaven to do the same and send down rain. Asses do not bray a liturgy to cloudless skies. Nor do cats attempt, by abstinence from cat?s meat, to wheedle the feline spirits into benevolence. Only man behaves with such gratuitous folly. It is the price he has to pay for being intelligent but not, as yet, quite intelligent enough.\n\n                                                                                              Aldous Huxley\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e4d7972b8d337da44cc0c419664c5713d59076c","amp;dn":"Sigur+Ros+new+album+-+TAKK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e4d7972b8d337da44cc0c419664c5713d59076c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,77,121,114,184,211,55,218,68,204,12,65,150,100,197,113,61,89,7,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
