This, after all, is a man who once planned to write 50 solo albums, one for each state in America (admittedly, he only got as far as two but hey, at least he dreamed big).\n\nSisyphus feels like yet another curveball, a collaboration between Stevens and alternative hip hop artists Serengeti and Son Lux (they were originally called s/s/s but Stevens thought it sounded too much like &quot;the Nazi Schutzstaffel with a lisp&quot;).\n\nThe record, which combines avant hip-hop production with Stevens' inherent grasp of gentle pop melody, was put together in a red wine-fuelled three weeks. &quot;We have so little in common but we have deep love for each other and we are pushing that stone together,&quot; says Stevens.\n\nHave a listen to it, ahead of release!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d43427236240bba124f3b78215cedffafb505a44","amp;dn":"Sisyphus+%282014%29+Full+Album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d43427236240bba124f3b78215cedffafb505a44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,52,39,35,98,64,187,161,36,243,183,130,21,206,223,250,251,80,90,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
