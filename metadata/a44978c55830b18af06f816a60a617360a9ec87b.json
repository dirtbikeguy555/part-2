The Seven Kingdoms are still in the grip of the War of the Five Kings, with Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy, Joffrey Baratheon, Stannis Baratheon and Renly Baratheon fighting to secure their crowns. Stannis Baratheon's attempt to take King's Landing has been defeated by the new alliance between House Lannister (backing Joffrey) and House Tyrell. House Martell has also pledged its support to the Lannisters though the forces of Dorne have yet to take the field. Meanwhile, a large host of wildlings is marching on the Wall under Mance Rayder, with only the tiny force of the Night's Watch in its path; and in the distant east, Daenerys Targaryen is on her way back to Pentos in the hope of raising forces to retake the Iron Throne.\n\nThis is an unabridged version read by Roy Dotrice\n\nThe recordings came directly from the CDs; there were 39 discs, approximately 72 minutes each (so total of approximately 47 hours)\n\nA Storm of Swords is the third installment in George R.R. Martin's fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a44978c55830b18af06f816a60a617360a9ec87b","amp;dn":"A+Storm+Of+Swords+-+Book+3+-+Unabridged+MP3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a44978c55830b18af06f816a60a617360a9ec87b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,73,120,197,88,48,177,138,240,111,129,106,96,166,23,54,10,158,200,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
