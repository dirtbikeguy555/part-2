A. Shaw\n\nRequested by a friend\n\nIt's called &quot;The Hard Way,&quot; but it's really quite simple. What's &quot;hard&quot; is this: it requires discipline, practice, and persistence. Zed A. Shaw teaches the Python programming language through a series of 52 brilliantly-crafted exercisesÃ¢â‚¬â€œall formatted consistently, and most no longer than two pages (including &quot;extra credit&quot;). Just read each exercise, type in its sample code precisely (no copy-and-paste!), and make the programs run. As you read, type, fix your mistakes, and watch the results, you'll learn how software works, how programming works, what good programs look like, and how to read, write, and see code.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93f04706f2e0ad981ee3f6ad262384357aac7584","amp;dn":"Learn+Python+The+Hard+Way%2C+3rd+Edition+-+Zed.+A.+Shaw.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93f04706f2e0ad981ee3f6ad262384357aac7584","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,240,71,6,242,224,173,152,30,227,246,173,38,35,132,53,122,172,117,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
