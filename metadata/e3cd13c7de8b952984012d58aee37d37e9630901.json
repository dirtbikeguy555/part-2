Murphyâ€™s detective work takes her from Europe to the United States and back, from the holdings of major museums to the moldering contents of forgotten archives. She braids together her own thrilling journey of discovery with a narrative of Van Goghâ€™s life in Arles, the sleepy ProvenÃ§al town where he created his finest work, and vividly reconstructs the world in which he movedâ€•the madams and prostitutes, cafÃ© patrons and police inspectors, shepherds and bohemian artists.\r\n\r\nWe encounter Van Goghâ€™s brother and benefactor Theo, his guest and fellow painter Paul Gauguin, and many local subjects of Van Goghâ€™s paintings, some of whom Murphy identifies for the first time. Strikingly, Murphy uncovers previously unknown information about â€œRachelâ€â€•and uses it to propose a bold new hypothesis about what was occurring in Van Goghâ€™s heart and mind as he made a mysterious delivery to her doorstep.\r\n\r\nAs it reopens one of art historyâ€™s most famous cold cases, Van Goghâ€™s Ear becomes a fascinating work of detection. It is also a study of a painter creating his most iconic and revolutionary work, pushing himself ever closer to greatness even as he edged toward madnessâ€•and one fateful sweep of the blade that would resonate through the ages","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3cd13c7de8b952984012d58aee37d37e9630901","amp;dn":"Van+Gogh%27s+Ear%3A+The+True+Story","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3cd13c7de8b952984012d58aee37d37e9630901","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,205,19,199,222,139,149,41,132,1,45,88,174,227,125,55,233,99,9,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
