Written by two veteran game programmers, the book examines the entire game development process and all the unique challenges associated with creating a game. In this excellent introduction to game architecture, you'll explore all the major subsystems of modern game engines and learn professional techniques used in actual games, as well as Teapot Wars, a game created specifically for this book. This updated fourth edition uses the latest versions of DirectX and Visual Studio, and it includes expanded chapter coverage of game actors, AI, shader programming, LUA scripting, the C# editor, and other important updates to every chapter. All the code and examples presented have been tested and used in commercial video games, and the book is full of invaluable best practices, professional tips and tricks, and cautionary advice.\n\nAbout the Author\nMike McShaffry, aka &quot;Mr. Mike,&quot; began programming games as soon as he could tap a keyboard. After graduating from the University of Houston, he worked for Warren Spector and Richard Garriott, aka &quot;Lord British,&quot; at Origin Systems on Martian Dreams, Ultima VII: The Black Gate, Ultima VIII: Pagan, Ultima IX: Ascension, and Ultima Online. Seven years later he formed his first company, Tornado Alley. Mike later accepted a position at Glass Eye Entertainment, working for his friend Monty Kerr, where he produced Microsoft Casino. Ten months later, Monty asked Mike and his newly assembled team to start their own company, called Compulsive Development, which would work exclusively with Microsoft on casual casino and card games. Mike served as the Head of Studio, and together with the rest of the Compulsive folks, produced three more casual titles for Microsoft until August 2002. Compulsive was acquired by Glass Eye Entertainment to continue work on Glass Eye's growing online casual games business. Mike was later recruited to start an Austin studio for Maryland-based Breakaway Games. Mike is currently self-employed, helping teams build a positive, creative and energetic environment so they can do what they do best--make great games.\nDavid &quot;Rez&quot; Graham is a self-taught programmer who has been writing games in his basement since 1996. In 2005, he landed a programming job at Super-Ego Games where he worked on mini-games and AI for Barbie Diaries: High School Mystery for the PC. He also worked on a comedy adventure game called RatRace for the PlayStation 3. In 2008, Rez went to work for Planet Moon and worked on Brain Quest for the Game Boy DS and Drawn to Life: The Next Chapter for the Wii. Rez went to PlayFirst in 2010 where he worked on Diner Dash: Grillin' Green for the iPad and was the lead engineer for Wedding Dash for the iPhone 4. Rez currently works at Electronic Arts as an AI programmer for the Sims division. He has shipped two titles there, which include The Sims Medieval and the Pirates &amp; Nobles Adventure Pack. He is currently the lead AI programmer for an upcoming Sims title.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6dff807715aef82839d362e2b7658102c4a4214","amp;dn":"Game+Coding+Complete+-+4th+Edition.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6dff807715aef82839d362e2b7658102c4a4214","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,223,248,7,113,90,239,130,131,157,54,46,43,118,88,16,44,74,66,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
