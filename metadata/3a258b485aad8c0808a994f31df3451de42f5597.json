Football Manager 2013 celebrates 20 years\nof games from the people at Sports Interactive by introducing an array\nof new features.\n\nThis year's version allows you to take control of any club in more than\n50 nations across the world and includes all of Europes biggest\nleagues as well as database of over 500,000 real-world players and\nstaff.\n\nAs well as some landmark new features in the Career Mode, there are now\nnew ways to enjoy your Football Manager experience.\n\nFeatures:\n\nNEW TO CAREER MODE\n\nMatch Engine\nThe 3D match engine has seen huge improvements this year. Everything on\nthe pitch looks more realistic; from the stadiums, the players\nmovement, intelligence, and the way the ball moves through the air.\n\nWe've also introduced hundreds of new animations to make the game feel\nmore realistic and weve made the whole experience more televisual by\nintroducing new camera angles and showing the kick-off and final\nwhistle.\n\nManager Roles\nAnother notable difference is the significant restructure of the\nmanagers staff and a revamp of their roles. The most obvious is that\nwe've introduced the position of Director of Football into the game for\nthe first time, which will allow managers to pass on some of their\nworkload, such as contract negotiations, if they choose to.\n\nIn addition to this, we've also increased the number of specialist\ncoaching roles within the game and given the manager greater\nflexibility to choose which coaches offer advice and when. The manager\ncan also choose to complain about boardroom interference - although\nthat particular option should probably be used sparingly.\n\nAnd much more\nA brand new training system, improved international management, tones\nin press conferences &amp; a new user interface.\n\nNEW WAYS TO PLAY\n\nClassic and Challenge Modes\nFootball Manager Classic is a less time-consuming way to enjoy Football\nManager. The essence of the game is exactly the same - the manager\nstill takes charge of a squad of players and competes at whatever level\nhe or she chooses - but they will now find that a number of their\nresponsibilities have either been taken over by their support staff or\nhave disappeared completely.\n\nFor example, while the player still takes charge of training in FMC,\nthis is carried out at a 'full team' level only there's no individual\nplayer training. And when it gets to matches themselves, there are no\nteam talks or opposition reports... you just go straight to a game\nusing the same 3D match engine as Career Mode. The games are played out\nin a quicker 'highlights only' fashion, but you can even speed this up\nby going straight to Instant Result!.\n\nPlayers who opt for Football Manager Classic will also find that they\nhave a couple of further options in terms of how they play the game;\nthey can either play a full open-ended &quot;Career&quot; or they can choose to\nplay in the new &quot;Challenge&quot; mode.\n\nIn Challenge mode they'll find themselves in a particular situation\nwhich will test their management skills over a shorter game time -\nusually half a season. Can you win a trophy with a team consisting\nalmost entirely of kids? Or could you guide your club to safety\ndespite being bottom of the table at Xmas?\n\nWe first introduced Challenge Mode in Football Manager Handheld 2012\nand it proved to be so popular that weve decided to include it in\nFMC too.\n\nThe game will come with four free-to-play challenges, each of which\nfeeds in to a global leaderboard.\n\nNetwork Play\nThe brand new Network Play is fully integrated with Steam's network\nfunctionality which means that players should be able to set up and\nenjoy games against their friends far more easily than before. The\nNetwork Mode also allows people to set-up special one-off leagues and\ncups and to import their team from their career mode, so you can now\nend any debate about whose FM team is better.\n\nThe deeper integration with Steam will also allow us to manage\nworldwide leaderboards, so, for the first time you'll really know how\ngood a manager you are.\n\nPlus over 900 other new features!\n\n\n\nINSTALL NOTES\n\n1.
