Here they faced their second largest ever crowd - 250,000 people - the first being their 1985 Rock In Rio performance to a crowd of 400,000, and with the relatively recent return of lead singer Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith to the band, they recorded their fifth live album.\n\nIt features many of their best known tracks, including the eponymous &quot;Iron Maiden&quot; and &quot;Run to the Hills&quot; coupled with some of their &quot;comeback&quot; tracks, such as &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; and &quot;Brave New World.&quot; Less popular songs were also performed, such as Bruce Dickinson's versions of the Blaze Bayley-era songs &quot;Sign of the Cross&quot; and &quot;The Clansman&quot;.\n\nROCK IN RIO [320k MP3]\n\nDisc 1\n\n   01. &quot;Intro (Arthur's Farewell)&quot; (Jerry Goldsmith) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:55\n   02. &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; (Bruce Dickinson, Adrian Smith, Steve Harris) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:41\n   03. &quot;Ghost of the Navigator&quot; (Dickinson, Janick Gers, Harris) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:48\n   04. &quot;Brave New World&quot; (Dickinson, Dave Murray, Harris) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:06\n   05. &quot;Wrathchild&quot; (Harris) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n   06. &quot;2 Minutes to Midnight&quot; (Dickinson, Smith) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:26\n   07. &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; (Harris) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:15\n   08. &quot;Sign of the Cross&quot; (Harris) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 10:49\n   09. &quot;The Mercenary&quot; (Gers, Harris) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:42\n   10. &quot;The Trooper&quot; (Harris) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:34\n\nDisc 2\n\n   01. &quot;Dream of Mirrors&quot; (Gers, Harris) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:38\n   02. &quot;The Clansman&quot; (Harris) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:19\n   03. &quot;The Evil That Men Do&quot; (Dickinson, Smith, Harris) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:40\n   04. &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot; (Harris) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:40\n   05. &quot;Iron Maiden&quot; (Harris) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:51\n   06. &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; (Harris) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:00\n   07. &quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name&quot; (Harris) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:23\n   08. &quot;Sanctuary&quot; (Paul Di'Anno, Murray, Harris) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:17\n   09. &quot;Run to the Hills&quot; (Harris) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:52\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    * Bruce Dickinson - lead vocals\n    * Dave Murray - guitar\n    * Janick Gers - guitar\n    * Adrian Smith - guitar, backing vocals\n    * Steve Harris - bass guitar, backing vocals\n    * Nicko McBrain - drums\n\nwith\n\n    * Michael Kenney - live keyboards\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e381e4fd1e3177f7dafa50a0fffeb030e31c8c7","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+%5C%27Rock+In+Rio%5C%27+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e381e4fd1e3177f7dafa50a0fffeb030e31c8c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,56,30,79,209,227,23,127,125,175,165,10,15,255,235,3,14,49,200,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
