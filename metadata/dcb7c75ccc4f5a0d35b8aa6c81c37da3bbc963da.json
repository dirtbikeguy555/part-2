Every known rock publication had nothing but praise for Blood Of The Nations. It is rare that all the media outlets rave so in unison about a band and a record.\n\nWhat makes ACCEPT such an astonishing success? The formula seems uncomplicated: As a band, they are a well oiled and hungry machine forging on with unbridled power and passion. It all started with the making of a great hard rock album. By involving master producer Andy Sneap, all the pieces fell into place. After just a couple days in the studio, all involved were in synch and knew right away: something big was brewing.\n\nThis could be a lesson for all budding metal bandsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think too much, just do and do so with all the might you can muster!\n\nACCEPT is backÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. In a world where metal has become imitative and stale, ACCEPT once again press forward with honest, visionary musical vigor and a dose of Teutonic Terror. Like a caged animal set free at last, they once again belong to the oligarchy of the worldwide hard rock and heavy metal scene! See them on Tour in 2011.\nThe new line-up made their live debut on May 8, 2010 at the sold-out Gramercy Theatre in New York City attended by a whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s who in the music industry. Performing for an audience of hundreds of fans, it was their first American concert in fifteen years. They played classic ACCEPT songs and debuted new material.\nOn May 21, 2010 their video for &quot;Teutonic Terror&quot; hit #5 on the worldwide video chars in all genres on MySpace, topping such artists as Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber and Christina Aguilera. The video also topped the MySpace Global Metal Charts at #1.\n\nIn May and June, ACCEPT opened for AC/DC at concerts in Hannover and Stuttgart, Germany, and on June 25, 2010 they were headliners in the Sonisphere festival in Romania and Turkey, playing for 2 hours, including their classics &quot;Balls to the Wall&quot;, &quot;Metal Heart&quot; and &quot;Princess of the Dawn&quot;. ACCEPT also played tracks off their new album. Blood Of The Nations was released in Europe on August 20, 2010 to sensational reviews and made an astounding chart debut at Number 4 in the official German Media Control Charts. It marks the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s highest chart debut in their entire career.\n\nBlood Of The Nations was then released on September 4 in Japan, and September 18, 2010 in the United States. Throughout the summer, ACCEPT spent 80 days traveling over 65,000 km and played in front of over 450,000 fans. In late October, the band appeared at the prestigious Japanese Festival Loudpark along such artists as Ozzy Osbourne, MotÃƒÂ¶rhead and Stone Sour. The rest of the year will be spent preparing for a major European Tour in the early parts of 2011.\n\n                  Description\nTitle\nLength\n1. &quot;Stampede&quot; 5:14\n2. &quot;Dying Breed&quot; 5:21\n3. &quot;Dark Side of My Heart&quot; 4:37\n4. &quot;Fall of the Empire&quot; 5:45\n5. &quot;Trail of Tears&quot; 4:08\n6. &quot;Wanna Be Free&quot; 5:37\n7. &quot;200 Years&quot; 4:30\n8. &quot;Bloodbath Mastermind&quot; 5:59\n9. &quot;From the Ashes We Rise&quot; 5:43\n10. &quot;The Curse&quot; 6:28\n11. &quot;Final Journey&quot; 5:02\n12.Thrown To The Wolves (bonus track for Japan)\n62:25 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcb7c75ccc4f5a0d35b8aa6c81c37da3bbc963da","amp;dn":"Accept+-+Blind+Rage++%28Japanese+Edition%29++mp3++320k++++++2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcb7c75ccc4f5a0d35b8aa6c81c37da3bbc963da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,183,199,92,204,79,90,13,53,184,170,108,129,195,125,163,187,201,99,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
