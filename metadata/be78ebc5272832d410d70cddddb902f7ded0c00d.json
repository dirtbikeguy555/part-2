The difficulty, however, is that instead of using the mind as a helpful servant we have largely allowed it to become the master of our lives. Its ambitions, belief systems, and interpretations rule our days and our nightsÃ¢â‚¬â€bringing us into conflict with minds that are different from ours, keeping us awake at night rehashing those conflicts or planning the conflicts of tomorrow, and disturbing our sleep and our dreams. If only there was a way to switch it off and give it a rest! Finding the switch that can silence the mindÃ¢â‚¬â€not by force or performing some exotic ritual, but through understanding, watchfulness, and a healthy sense of humorÃ¢â‚¬â€is meditation. A sharper, more relaxed and creative mindÃ¢â‚¬â€one that can function at the peak of its unique intelligenceÃ¢â‚¬â€is the potential.The book will include a link to tutorials on OSHO Nadabrahma Meditation.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be78ebc5272832d410d70cddddb902f7ded0c00d","amp;dn":"Learning+to+Silence+the+Mind+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be78ebc5272832d410d70cddddb902f7ded0c00d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,120,235,197,39,40,50,212,16,215,12,221,221,185,2,247,222,208,192,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
