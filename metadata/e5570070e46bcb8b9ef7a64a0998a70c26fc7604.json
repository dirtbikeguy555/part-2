It's a synth\n     powerhouse and yet is very easy to use thanks to its performance\n     controls and remix pads. Just tweak the library of excellent presets\n     from many of the world's top sound designers or dive in and analyse\n     your own samples - it's up to you!\n\n\n     Alchemy features additive, spectral and granular synthesis and\n     resynthesis, sampling, and a very capable virtual analog engine with\n     unison and PWM. You can morph or crossfade between sources. You can\n     import your own samples from SFZ, WAV or AIFF files. A wide range of\n     analog modelled filters are included, in addition to a flexible rack\n     of effects which includes all those from CamelPhat and CamelSpace as\n     well as many new effects such as a high quality reverb. The innovative\n     modulation system is extremely flexible, yet easy to use. Alchemy also\n     features a powerful arpeggiator with the ability to import the groove\n     from any MIDI file for immediate synchronization to a beat.\n\n\n\n\n     Requirements:\n\n     OSX 10.4.9, 2 GHz Intel or G5, 1 GB RAM, 3 GB disk space, Audio Units\n     or VST 2.4 host. Intel Core2Duo and 2 GB RAM recommended.\n\n\n&lt;font face=&quot;arial&quot; size=&quot;+1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;iNSTALL NOTES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\n\n\t1.\tUnpack and mount the dmg\n\n\t2.\tDrag the .rar files to your desktop\n\n\tNote: The two AlchemyFactory-***.rars are required for Alchemy to run properly.
