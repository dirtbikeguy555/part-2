The film follows metal fan and anthropologist Sam Dunn on a whirlwind journey through Asia, South America and the Middle East as he explores the underbelly of the world's emerging extreme music scenes; from Indonesian death metal to Chinese black metal to Iranian thrash metal. GLOBAL METAL reveals a worldwide community of metalheads who aren't just absorbing metal from the West - they're transforming it - creating a new form of cultural expression in societies dominated by conflict, corruption and mass-consumerism.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1249171/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1249171/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8271057d83dc9618af2c6c71b85f6ba753bcadfc","amp;dn":"Global.Metal.2008.LiMiTED.DVDRIP.XVID-iGNiTE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8271057d83dc9618af2c6c71b85f6ba753bcadfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,113,5,125,131,220,150,24,175,44,108,113,184,95,107,167,83,188,173,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
