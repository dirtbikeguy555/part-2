He was poised to challenge the newly elected U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower with armed force, and was also broadening a vicious campaign against Soviet Jews. StalinÃ¢Â€â„¢s sudden collapse and death in March 1953 was as dramatic and mysterious as his life. It is no overstatement to say that his passing marked a major turning point in the twentieth century. \r\n\r\nThe Last Days of Stalin is an engaging, briskly told account of the dictatorÃ¢Â€â„¢s final active months, the vigil at his deathbed, and the unfolding of Soviet and international events in the months after his death. Rubenstein throws fresh light on \r\n\r\nthe devious plotting of Beria, Malenkov, Khrushchev, and other â€œcomrades in armsâ€ who well understood the significance of the dictatorÃ¢Â€â„¢s impending death; \r\nthe witness-documented events of his death as compared to official published versions; \r\nStalinÃ¢Â€â„¢s rumored plans to forcibly exile Soviet Jews; \r\nthe responses of Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dulles to the KremlinÃ¢Â€â„¢s conciliatory gestures after StalinÃ¢Â€â„¢s death; and \r\nthe momentous repercussions when StalinÃ¢Â€â„¢s regime of terror was cut short","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:828ef90aa1f083d14ef0d4ad26f202ed1284dc24","amp;dn":"THE+LAST+DAYS+OF+STALIN+%282016%29+BY+JOSHUA+RUBENSTEIN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"828ef90aa1f083d14ef0d4ad26f202ed1284dc24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,142,249,10,161,240,131,209,78,240,212,173,38,242,2,237,18,132,220,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
