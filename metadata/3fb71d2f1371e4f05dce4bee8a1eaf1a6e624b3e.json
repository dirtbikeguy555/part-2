Having been estranged for over 30 years, it is only now in death that he learns the true extent of his father's humiliation in Auschwitz at the hands of former SS Officer Aloise Muller - an event he is determined to avenge. So begins a life-altering journey across the heartland of America to track down and confront his father's nemesis. As his quest unfolds, Cheyenne is reawakened by the people he encounters and his journey is transformed into one of reconciliation and self discovery. As his date with destiny arrives and he tracks down Muller, Cheyenne must finally decide if it is redemption he seeks\n\n\nScreenshots:\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.minus.com/iH9Y3vp3kJP2P.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.minus.com/iH9Y3vp3kJP2P.png&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.minus.com/ib1wYfCJXQNvMD.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.minus.com/ib1wYfCJXQNvMD.png&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.minus.com/ihi7wcUbkrv0k.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.minus.com/ihi7wcUbkrv0k.png&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fb71d2f1371e4f05dce4bee8a1eaf1a6e624b3e","amp;dn":"This+Must+Be+the+Place+%282011%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+750MB+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fb71d2f1371e4f05dce4bee8a1eaf1a6e624b3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,183,29,47,19,113,228,240,93,206,75,238,138,30,175,26,110,98,75,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
