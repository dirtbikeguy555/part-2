If you can't figure out how to run this, you don't need the Ultimate version of IntelliJ.\n\n(Unlike my previous keygen uploads, I guarantee that it's clean. It's a command-line Java program (package-less .class file) with source code. I compiled the source code with javac from Oracle JDK 7u45 on 64-bit Linux. If you want to be sure that )the .class file matches the source code, feel free to recompile it yourself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b16f7a24ba8fe13cb4f27be2afa1263bd20ccd1","amp;dn":"JetBrains+IntelliJ+IDEA+13+Keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b16f7a24ba8fe13cb4f27be2afa1263bd20ccd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,22,247,162,75,168,254,19,203,79,39,190,42,250,18,99,189,32,204,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
