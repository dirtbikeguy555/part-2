The video is roughly fifty minutes long, but it flies by. \n\nI would not recommend this workout for fitness newbies, but I definitely would recommend it for kick boxing newbies. Jeanette's direction and the beginner/lower impact variations of the movements really allow for quick catching-on. The workout is still great for the intermediate kick boxer (such as myself). \n\nMy only gripe is the music. Ugh. Really awful, particularly during the warm up. But once you've familiarized yourself with the routine and no longer need the verbalized direction, mute the volume and listen to your own music choice. At least that's what I've done.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c0f3b5be414c0800511b2e303522210be2602f7","amp;dn":"The+Hollywood+Trainer+-+Kickboxing+Bootcamp+%5BDVDRip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c0f3b5be414c0800511b2e303522210be2602f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,15,59,91,228,20,192,128,5,17,178,227,3,82,34,16,190,38,2,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
