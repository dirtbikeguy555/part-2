I also have some other hard to find movies and Madea plays that I will start Ripping and compressing. Thanks for the support and hope you enjoy the upload.\n\nHarper Stewart, a commitment-shy writer and the best man at the wedding of Lance and Mia, is nervous--and with good reason. His steamy new novel hits bookstores soon, and when his friends finally read it he knows they will notice more than just a passing resemblance to the characters depicted in the book. To make matters worse, one of the bridesmaids, Jordan, an ambitious TV producer, has obtained an advance copy of the book--and it's making the rounds with all his friends. With vows about to be exchanged and friendships renewed, the pressure is on. For by the end of the weekend, scandalous secrets from the book involving close friends and loved ones will be revealed, and everyone will have re-evaluated their friendships with each other, their lovers and with themselves--for better or for worse. \n \nActors \nTaye Diggs            Harper \nNia Long              Jordan \nMorris Chestnut       Lance \nHarold Perrineau Jr   Murch \nTerrence Howard       Quentin \nSanaa Lathan          Robin \nMonica Calhoun        Mia \nMelissa DeSousa       Shelby \nVictoria Dillard      Anita \nRegina Hall           Candy \nJim Moody (II)        Uncle Skeeter \nJarrod Bunch          Wayne \nStu Riley             Fandango \nLiris Crosse          Stripper \nLady Madonna          Stripper \nLinda Powell          Wedding Coordinator \nWillie C.
