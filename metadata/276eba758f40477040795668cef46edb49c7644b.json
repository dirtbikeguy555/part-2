Xvid. \n\nHow do you improve the best selling motorcycle video in the world?\n\nYou make learning the 3 motor office techniques easier to understand.\n\nYou do not need to have Ride Like a Pro I thru IV, my Ride Like a Pro V contains all the tips, tricks and techniques from those versions plus much, much more!\n\nWe show the most common mistakes actual students make while taking this very course so that you recognize and avoid those mistakes.\n\nWe show a diagram of the proper line through the turns actually painted on the course as it&amp;#039;s being ridden.\n\nWe show what happens to students when the proper line is not followed. We show overhead views of the pro&amp;#039;s doing it the correct way.\n\nIn addition, I&amp;#039;ll show you new exercises in the citizen&amp;#039;s portion that will help you to transition to the actual motor officer course you&amp;#039;ll see later in this video. \n\nIf youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve ever seen  Motor Officers handle their heavy weight cruisers with the ease of a childÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s toy and wonder in amazement how they do it, wonder no more.\n\n This DVD will show you how to use the 3 simple Motor Officer techniques the cops have been trained in for more that 60 years. Until now, these training secrets have not been available to the general public.\n\nI have developed a simple step by step procedure that will allow you to master the 3 Motor Officer techniques in just 3 to 4 hours. I know my step by step plan works because IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve put hundreds of students through the exact course youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll see on this DVD.  \n\nI use a modified version of the Police Motor Officer course that can be mastered in just 1 day. Even riders with 20 years of experience will improve their skills by 100%. \n\nThis DVD will also show you how to master the actual Police Motor Officer course so that, you too, can be among the top 2% of riders in America.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:276eba758f40477040795668cef46edb49c7644b","amp;dn":"Ride+Like+a+Pro+V+%28Xvid+-+AC3+2.0+-+English%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"276eba758f40477040795668cef46edb49c7644b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,110,186,117,143,64,71,112,64,121,86,104,206,244,110,219,73,199,100,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
