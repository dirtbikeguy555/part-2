He is a single father living with his two school-going daughters. Episodes focus on events in his everyday life, and are bookended by clips from his stand-up routine. C.K. is the only regular in the show, and even his daughters are portrayed by more than one actor. The style of humor is often sexual and racist, with occasional use of vulgar language. C.K. exercises total freedom in the episodes he creates and there are few boundaries established throughout the show, with episodes dealing with such diverse topics as picking up the kids from school to doing drugs at his next-door neighbor's. Most of his stand-up routines mirror his real life and often have little or no association with the topic of the episode. \n\n\nGeneral Information\n\n Status: Pending\n Premiere: June 29, 2010\n Classification: Scripted\n Genre: Comedy | Drama | Sketch/Improv | Talent\n Network: FX (USA)\n Airs: Mondays at 10:00 &amp; 10:30 pm\n Runtime: 30 Minutes\n\n\nSeason 4 -- 14 Episodes\n\n 4x01 -- May 05, 2014 -- Back\n 4x02 -- May 05, 2014 -- Model\n 4x03 -- May 12, 2014 -- So Did the Fat Lady\n 4x04 -- May 12, 2014 -- Elevator Part 1\n 4x05 -- May 19, 2014 -- Elevator Part 2\n 4x06 -- May 19, 2014 -- Elevator Part 3\n 4x07 -- May 26, 2014 -- Elevator Part 4\n 4x08 -- May 26, 2014 -- Elevator Part 5\n 4x09 -- Jun 02, 2014 -- Elevator Part 6\n 4x10 -- Jun 02, 2014 -- Pamela 1\n 4x11 -- Jun 09, 2014 -- In The Woods 1\n 4x12 -- Jun 09, 2014 -- In The Woods 2\n 4x13 -- Jun 16, 2014 -- Pamela 2\n 4x14 -- Jun 16, 2014 -- Pamela 3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba559b56cd9bc6d0852538a2bf9db881a485203e","amp;dn":"Louie+-+The+Complete+Season+4+%5BHDTV%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba559b56cd9bc6d0852538a2bf9db881a485203e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,85,155,86,205,155,198,208,133,37,56,162,191,157,184,129,164,133,32,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
