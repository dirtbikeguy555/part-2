She makes clear why praising intelligence and ability doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t foster self-esteem and lead to accomplishment, but may actually jeopardize success. With the right mindset, we can motivate our kids and help them to raise their grades, as well as reach our own goalsÃ¢â‚¬â€œpersonal and professional. Dweck reveals what all great parents, teachers, CEOs, and athletes already know: how a simple idea about the brain can create a love of learning and a resilience that is the basis of great accomplishment in every area.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17b3ed64922d026e44df30c528fa920cc3044bc9","amp;dn":"Carol+Dweck+-+Mindset%3A+The+New+Psychology+of+Success+%28MOBI%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17b3ed64922d026e44df30c528fa920cc3044bc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,179,237,100,146,45,2,110,68,223,48,197,40,250,146,12,195,4,75,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
