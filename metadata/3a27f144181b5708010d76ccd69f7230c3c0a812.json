Easily sculpt your tracks with rich, harmonically-driven sound. Loaded with additional saturation and character controls for detailed tweaking, SUPERCHARGER GT goes beyond compression to shift your inspiration into overdrive.\n\n                     BEYOND COMPRESSION\n\nSUPERCHARGER GT delivers more than just rich tube compression. New saturation types give you three ways to turn up the heat.\n\nUse Mild, Crisp, and Slam modes to enliven tracks with anything from subtle harmonic enhancement to scorching, raw attitude. Fat, Warm, and Aggressive character modes fill in missing low end and smooth out unruly high frequencies with the turn of a single knob.\n\n                    FINE-TUNED CONTROL\n\nSUPERCHARGER GT keeps you in the sweet spot with creative controls. Automatic make-up gain keeps you focused on the sound of the effect. Choose from popular Attack and Release settings. Dedicated response controls let you fine tune to perfection.\n\nMid/side mode lets you carve out space in your mix. And the detector high pass prevents unruly low end signals in the sidechain from mis-triggering the compressor.\n\n\n  \n                      SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\n\nWindows: Windows 8, Windows 7 (latest Service Pack, 32/64 Bit), Intel Core Duo or AMD Athlon 64 X2, 2 GB RAM (4 GB recommended)\n\nSupported interfaces: VST, RTAS, AAX 32- and 64-bit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                       Installation\n\n.
