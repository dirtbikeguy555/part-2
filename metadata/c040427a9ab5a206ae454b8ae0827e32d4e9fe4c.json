When he was awarded the 1999 Nobel Prize in Literature, the Swedish Academy noted him as a writer &quot;whose frolicsome black fables portray the forgotten face of history.&quot;\n\nHe is best known among English-language readers for his &quot;Danzig Trilogy&quot;, a series of novels that focus on the interwar and wartime period in the Free City of Danzig (now GdaÃ…â€žsk, Poland): THE TIN DRUM (in two translations), acclaimed as the greatest German novel written since the end of World War II, is the autobiography of thirty-year-old Oskar Matzerath, who has lived through the long Nazi nightmare and who, as the novel begins, is being held in a mental institution; CAT AND MOUSE, centered on the narrator's vivid recollection of a boyhood scene during World War II; and DOG YEARS, a novel in three parts, beginning in the 1920s and ending in the 1950s, that follows the lives of two friends from the prewar years in Germany through an apocalyptic period and its startling aftermath.\n\n\nThis collection features 11 novels, as well as plays, poetry, and essays, which are in PDF format unless otherwise indicated below:\n\n* THE CALL OF THE TOAD (Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co, 1992).
