Seger may have been this consistent before (on Seven, for example), but the mood had never been as successfully varied, nor had his songwriting been as consistent, intimate, and personal.\n \nThankfully, this was delivered to a mass audience eager for Seger, and it not only became a hit, but one of the universally acknowledged high points of late-'70s rock &amp; roll. And, because of his passion and craft, it remains a thoroughly terrific record years later.\n\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4d68c53ade6b285b6020cacfcf06f3c28dcc920","amp;dn":"Bob+Seger+%26amp%3B+The+Silver+Bullet+Band+-+Night+Moves+1976+%2F+Rema","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4d68c53ade6b285b6020cacfcf06f3c28dcc920","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,214,140,83,173,230,178,133,182,2,12,172,252,240,111,60,40,220,201,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
