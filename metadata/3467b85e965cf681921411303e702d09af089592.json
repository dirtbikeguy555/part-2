In point of fact, however, the link up between Dion and the Belmonts actually lasted only two years, and the group existed (albeit briefly) prior to and a long after his time with them. Angelo D'Aleo (born February 3, 1940), first tenor; Fred Milano (born August 22, 1939), second tenor; and Carlo Mastrangelo (b. October 5, 1938), baritone; and Dion DiMucci were all friends from the area around Belmont Avenue in the Bronx, in N.Y.C. They attended Roosevelt High School and hung out together, and all of them sang; D'Aleo, Milano, and Mastrangelo began singing together and named themselves the Belmonts. As a trio, they recorded for the Mohawk label in 1957, making their debut with the song &quot;Teenage Clementine,&quot; which came and went without notice. It was when Mastrangelo wrote a song of his own, &quot;We Went Away,&quot; that was heard by Dion, that the quartet came together. It was recorded for Mohawk under the direction of conductor/arranger Hugo Montenegro (who had previously arranged an abortive debut single by Dion with a separate backing group), and the B-side got onto several local radio play lists.\n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\n01.The Wanderer\n02.A Teenager In Love\n03.Runaround Sue\n04.Where Or When\n05.Lonely Teenager\n06.I Wonder Why\n07.Lovers Who Wander\n08.No One Knows\n09.Little Diane\n10.Love Came To Me\n11.When You Wish Upon A Star\n12.Ruby Baby\n13.Donna The Prima Donna\n14.Drip Drop\n15.This Little Girl\n16.Sandy\n17.In The Still Of The Night\n18.Be Careful Of Stones That You Throw\n19.The Majestic\n20.Abraham, Martin And John\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3467b85e965cf681921411303e702d09af089592","amp;dn":"Dion+%26+The+Belmonts+-+Greatest+Hits+%281999%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3467b85e965cf681921411303e702d09af089592","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,103,184,94,150,92,246,129,146,20,17,48,62,112,45,9,175,8,149,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
