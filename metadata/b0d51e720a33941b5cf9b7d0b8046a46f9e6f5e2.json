Convicts in our Prison State print stationary, build furniture, rebuild and restore cars, and, YES! They still churn out vehicle license plates! \nThis makes for a thriving prison industry program (an euphemism for slave labor since inmates get paid way, way, way the F? below minimum wage, no paid vacation, retirement, Workers Comp., etc. ?cos they owe a ?debt to society?. And you thought it was unconstitutional for debtors to be jailed? Hah! Think again!). Like in the days of yore, captive labor is commonly contracted out to private enterprise ? a very profitable arrangement. Imagine a gripe-free labor force: they come to work on time, take on what?s dished out to them, perform with devotion for just cents on the dollar, and never complain! Happy! Happy! Happy! \n\nI came across this material secreted in an apartment I had moved into. Along with some notes written in pencil by a former tenant ?Shifty?, a newly paroled entrepreneur. Apparently, he was done with drudging for an exploitative monopoly! So he came up with this brilliant idea that would affect his smooth transition back into mainstream society: HIS VERY OWN HOME-WORKSHOP DMV  for those who couldn?t be bothered standing for hours in those long dang lines coveting derriÃƒÂ¨res of those in front. Just mail in your personal data and a good passport size photograph along with fifty smackeroos, and you?ll get your new ID in the mail! WOW! Now THAT?S what I?d call service to the public! Shifty had an Ad. out along similar lines to the Army Recruitment commercial, ?BE ALL THAT YOU CAN BE? ? WITH HELP FROM SHIFTY ? IT?LL ONLY COST YA FIFTY! Shifty believed in the Honor System: if you claimed to be a good driver, looked like Brad Pitt, and lived in Schmuksville, AK ? So be it! Who?s he to tell you any different?  \n\nWell ? From what I gather, he got railroaded by the competition and kicked back into the slammer! So much for free enterprise! Some people are just too damn constipated to have a sense of humor!\n\nAnyway, SHIFTY: IN WHICHEVER STATE GUESTHOUSE YOU MAY BE IN, THESE TEMPLATES BELONG TO YOU, ?DAWG. SO, HERE! HAVE ?EM BACK! But first, play it safe and run your AV-AS on the files to be certain of their integrity. Some .exe files in the ?Applications? sub-section caused a minor episcrotal itch but checked out fine with Norton and Zone Alarm.\n\nAnd if you?re not Shifty, please don?t pirate his sheatt, Dude. Even if you have innocent intentions of using it for ?educational purposes only? (e.g., Felony 101), remember this is how criminals find themselves butt-boned in the slammer. You should never try this at home; not in your own home anyway (unless you?re a dumb criminal, You Dumb Criminal)! And when you get caught, just go ahead and flash your fake Federal Law Enforcement ID Card and demand ?professional courtesy?! It might give you a little time to bolt while they?re splittin? their sides laughing!\n \nAnd keep Shifty out of this, OK? Or I?ll have no other choice but to stick blunt, rusty needles into this here BETTY BEULAH, my trusty inflatable Voodoo doll while chanting killer Mantras over a bong, a six-pack, and a Skynnard CD! L8R!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0d51e720a33941b5cf9b7d0b8046a46f9e6f5e2","amp;dn":"FAKE+ID+-+DRIVER+LICENSE+TEMPLATES","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0d51e720a33941b5cf9b7d0b8046a46f9e6f5e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,213,30,114,10,51,148,27,92,249,183,208,184,4,106,70,249,230,245,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
