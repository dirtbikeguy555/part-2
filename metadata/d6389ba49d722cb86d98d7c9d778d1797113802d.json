Materials that store this energy for work are called fuels. Some fuels contain more energy than others. This is called energy density.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Economic expansion has resulted in increases in atmospheric nitrous oxide and methane, ozone depletion, increases in great floods, damage to ocean ecosystems, including nitrogen runoff, loss of rainforest and woodland, increases in domesticated land, and species extinctions.&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;The global food supply relies heavily on fossil fuels. Before WW1, all agriculture was Organic. Following the invention of fossil fuel derived fertilisers and pesticides there were massive improvements in food production, allowing for increases in human population.The use of artificial fertilisers has fed far more people than would have been possible with organic agriculture alone.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nFormat: MP4\r\nFrame rate: 24 fps\r\nData rate: 966kbps\r\nTotal bitrate: 1122kbps\r\nResolution: 1280 x 720\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nBitrate: 125 kbps\r\nChannels: Stereo\r\nSample rate: 44khz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6389ba49d722cb86d98d7c9d778d1797113802d","amp;dn":"There%27s+No+Tomorrow+%28Peak+Oil%29+-+Environmental+Documentary+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6389ba49d722cb86d98d7c9d778d1797113802d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,56,155,164,157,114,44,184,109,152,215,201,215,120,209,121,113,19,128,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
