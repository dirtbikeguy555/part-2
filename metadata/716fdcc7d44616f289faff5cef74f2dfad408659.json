While Eisenstein takes certain liberties in characterization--those opposing the Bolsheviks are depicted as mental defectives or grossly overweight clowns--his re-creation of such events as the storming of the Winter Palace are painstakingly meticulous. The &quot;actor&quot; playing Lenin, a nonprofessional worker named Nikandrov, so closely resembles the genuine article that the effect is positively eerie. So authentic is Eisenstein's reconstruction of events that, for years, TV documentaries have been passing off clips from Ten Days That Shook the World as &quot;actual&quot; scenes of the Revolution. While impressive on a technical level, the film never truly stirs the audience's emotions; Eisenstein purists have argued that this &quot;alienation&quot; technique was the director's intention all along, forcing the viewer to observe the events intellectually rather than emotionally. Produced in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the October Revolution, Ten Days That Shook the World was initially titled October.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Oktyabr.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.39 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 55mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 728 Kbps\n      Writing application : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\n      Writing library : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 55mn\n      Bit rate : 1 527 Kbps\n      Width : 656 pixels\n      Height : 496 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.188\n      Stream size : 1.23 GiB (88%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 55mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 158 MiB (11%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n\nIMDB: tt0018217\n\nSilent with Russian intertitles; English, French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nMy rip of the Ruscico DVD\n\nAleksandrov, Eisenstein - Oktyabr [1928]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:716fdcc7d44616f289faff5cef74f2dfad408659","amp;dn":"Aleksandrov%2C+Eisenstein+-+Oktyabr+%5B1928%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"716fdcc7d44616f289faff5cef74f2dfad408659","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,111,220,199,212,70,22,242,137,250,255,92,239,116,242,223,173,64,134,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
