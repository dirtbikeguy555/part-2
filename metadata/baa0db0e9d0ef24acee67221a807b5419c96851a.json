After a Jedi ambush, the Sith mining ship Omen lies wrecked on a remote, unknown planet. Its commander, Yaru Korsin, battles the bloodshed of a mutinous faction led by his own brother. Marooned and facing death, the Sith crew have no choice but to venture into their desolate surroundings. They face any number of brutal challengesÃ¢â‚¬â€vicious predators, lethal plagues, tribal people who worship vengeful godsÃ¢â‚¬â€and like true Sith warriors, counter them with the dark side of the Force.\n\nThe struggles are just beginning for the proud, uncompromising Sith, driven as they are to rule at all costs. They will vanquish the primitive natives, and they will find their way back to their true destiny as rulers of the galaxy. But as their legacy grows over thousands of years, the Sith ultimately find themselves tested by the most dangerous threat of all: the enemy within.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13023324-lost-tribe-of-the-sith&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13023324-lost-tribe-of-the-sith&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:baa0db0e9d0ef24acee67221a807b5419c96851a","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+%5BLOST+TRIBE+OF+THE+SITH+Complete%5D+John+jackson+Miller","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"baa0db0e9d0ef24acee67221a807b5419c96851a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,160,219,14,157,14,242,74,206,230,114,33,168,7,181,65,156,150,133,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
