Filmed in the mid-to-late 1980s, it chronicles the ball culture of New York City and the poor, African American and Latino gay and transgendered community involved in it. Many consider Paris Is Burning to be an invaluable documentary of the end of the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of New York City drag balls, as well as a thoughtful exploration of race, class, and gender in America.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:250f18a8c17865fb05be1c1fee7acab569cf5821","amp;dn":"PARIS+IS+BURNING+-+A+GAY+DOCUMENTARY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"250f18a8c17865fb05be1c1fee7acab569cf5821","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,15,24,168,193,120,101,251,5,190,28,31,238,122,202,181,105,207,88,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
