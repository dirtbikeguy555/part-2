In this course veteran trainer and author Eric Wing takes you step by step through the process of building a five-story, multiple-use office building. You will learn how to create a model, use different views, work with the Revit tools, and add dimensions and annotations. Then youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll delve into details like floors, roofs, ceilings, stairs, walls, and structural items like grids, columns, and foundations. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll end up with a complete, realistic design Ã¢â‚¬â€ and the skills you need to start creating your own.\n\nTrainer: Eric Wing\n\nEric Wing, lead blogger at BIM Nation, is a nationally recognized trainer, consultant, speaker, and author. He has written three books specifically related to the Revit platform: Revit Architecture 2010, Mastering Revit Structure (co-author), and Revit Structure Fundamentals.
