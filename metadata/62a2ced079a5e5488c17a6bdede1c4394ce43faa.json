The author clearly shows that the Shanghai Group did not break radically with tradition, but, indeed, had profound and fruitful links with it. The connection with the past is traced through a thousand years of Chinese history, especially with the Hua niao Hua' and 'Hsieh-i' modes of painting. In addition to examining the works of the individual artists, the book explains the characteristic media and techniques used.
