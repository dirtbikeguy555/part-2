Suddenly, instead of simply whodunit,solving crimes was a matter of howdunit, and with what size shoe, andwhether anyone left behind traces of evidence that the blue ALS lightcould pick up. \n\nNow that gritty approach to crime known as forensic science makes itsway from Las Vegas to the streets of Florida in CSI: Miami. A whole newteam of crime scene investigators is on hand to probe the seamyunderside of what some refer to as Cuba North and others call GeorgiaSouth. Consider it a tropical blend of people, culture, nightlife and,of course, the occasional killing or two. Just as you do in Vegas, comefor the crime, stick around for the clues. And there&amp;#039;s always a clue. \n_______________________________\n\nThe Team\n\nHoratio Caine is the lead criminologist, sort of the Grissom of thespin-off. But he&amp;#039;s got a dangerous edge and a &quot;blind allegiance tojustice.&quot; \n\n\nTim Speedle was a young, well-educated criminalist who did his job inhonor of his high school friend, who died two years after he wasparalyzed in a snowmobile accident. He died on duty when he was shot ina jewelry store while investigating a murder. \n\n\nEric Delko is a funny and lovable character, now working as a CSI, specializing in underwater recovery. \n\n\nAlexx Woods is a young coroner. Alexx has the education that has earnedher the nickname &quot;knowologist,&quot; and she often challenges the otherCSIs. She is known to talk to the victims. \n\n\nCalleigh Duquesne is the team&amp;#039;s ballistics expert, sometimes known as the &quot;bullet girl.&quot; \n\n\nRyan Wolfe is the newest member of the team. He is young and often thinks outside the box to help solve cases.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:128af4352e913188045c6ec8a3492c3d0ffb3b2a","amp;dn":"CSI+Miami+-+Season+03+%28Complete%29+HDTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"128af4352e913188045c6ec8a3492c3d0ffb3b2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,138,244,53,46,145,49,136,4,92,110,200,163,73,44,61,15,251,59,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
