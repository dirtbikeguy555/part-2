Yet for nearly all of its six million years of existence, human society had none of these things. While the gulf that divides us from our primitive ancestors may seem unbridgeably wide, we can glimpse much of our former lifestyle in those largely traditional societies still or recently in existence. Societies like those of the New Guinea Highlanders remind us that it was only yesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â€in evolutionary timeÃ¢â‚¬â€when everything changed and that we moderns still possess bodies and social practices often better adapted to traditional than to modern conditions.\n \n \n \nThe World Until Yesterday provides a mesmerizing firsthand picture of the human past as it had been for millions of yearsÃ¢â‚¬â€a past that has mostly vanishedÃ¢â‚¬â€and considers what the differences between that past and our present mean for our lives today.\nThis is Jared DiamondÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most personal book to date, as he draws extensively from his decades of field work in the Pacific islands, as well as evidence from Inuit, Amazonian Indians, Kalahari San people, and others. Diamond doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t romanticize traditional societiesÃ¢â‚¬â€after all, we are shocked by some of their practicesÃ¢â‚¬â€but he finds that their solutions to universal human problems such as child rearing, elder care, dispute resolution, risk, and physical fitness have much to teach us. A characteristically provocative, enlightening, and entertaining book, The World Until Yesterday will be essential and delightful reading.\n \n \n \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:137778925132a145570048225607664a869956c5","amp;dn":"%5B2012%5D+The+World++Until+Yesterday+%5BEPUB%5D-+What+Can+We+Learn+-%5BQw","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"137778925132a145570048225607664a869956c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,119,120,146,81,50,161,69,87,0,72,34,86,7,102,74,134,153,86,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
