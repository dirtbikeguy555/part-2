How did we come to spend so much of our time filling out forms? And just how much are our lives being ruined by all this nonstop documentation?\n\nTo answer these questions, anthropologist David GraeberÃ¢â‚¬â€one of our most important and provocative thinkersÃ¢â‚¬â€traces the peculiar and unexpected ways we relate to bureaucracy today and reveals how it shapes our lives in ways we may not even notice. Is the inane, annoying paperwork we confront every day really a cipher for state violence? And is the capitalist promise of salvation-through-technology just a tool for the powerful to exert more control? Graeber provides a forceful, radical answer to these questions, though he also suggests that there may be something perversely appealingÃ¢â‚¬â€even romanticÃ¢â‚¬â€about bureaucracy.\n\nLeaping from the ascendance of right-wing economics in the second half of the twentieth century to the hidden meanings behind James Bond, Sherlock Holmes, and Batman, The Utopia of Rules is at once a powerful work of social theory in the tradition of Foucault and Marx, and an entertaining reckoning with popular culture that calls to mind Slavoj Ã…Â½iÃ…Â¾ek at his most accessible.\n\nAn essential book for our times, The Utopia of Rules is sure to start a million conversations about the institutions that rule our livesÃ¢â‚¬â€and the better, freer world we should, perhaps, begin to imagine for ourselves.\n\n\nHardcover: 272 pages\nPublisher: Melville House (24 February 2015)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1612193749\nISBN-13: 978-1612193748\n\nCome &amp; Join Suprbay, Post Requests, Suggestions &amp; Surf the TPB Forum. \n\n                                    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/index.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/index.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\n__________________\n\n\nAnd, My Link On Suprbay:\n                                    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Thread-Promising-ebooks-Audio-Books-Torrents-by-The-Abee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Thread-Promising-ebooks-Audio-Books-Torrents-by-The-Abee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGet me there. :)\n\n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n\n\n                                                     :)__Abee","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0c16a013249a578dafaec10365d2f6ec32082c0","amp;dn":"The+Utopia+of+Rules%3AOn+Technology%2C+Stupidity..David+Graeber+ABEE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0c16a013249a578dafaec10365d2f6ec32082c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,193,106,1,50,73,165,120,218,250,236,16,54,93,47,110,195,32,130,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
