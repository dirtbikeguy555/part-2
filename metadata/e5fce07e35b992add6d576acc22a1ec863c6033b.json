Ex-servicemen are disillusioned; the out-of-work and the hungry are demanding change. And in South London, in a genteel Camberwell villaÃ¢â‚¬â€a large, silent house now bereft of brothers, husband, and even servantsÃ¢â‚¬â€life is about to be transformed as impoverished widow Mrs. Wray and her spinster daughter, Frances, are obliged to take in lodgers.\n\nWith the arrival of Lilian and Leonard Barber, a modern young couple of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“clerk class,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the routines of the house will be shaken up in unexpected ways. Little do the Wrays know just how profoundly their new tenants will alter the course of FrancesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€or, as passions mount and frustration gathers, how far-reaching, and how devastating, the disturbances will be.\n\nShort-listed for the Man Booker Prize three times, Sarah Waters has earned a reputation as one of our greatest writers of historical fiction, and here she has delivered again. A love story, a tension-filled crime story, and a beautifully atmospheric portrait of a fascinating time and place, The Paying Guests is Sarah WatersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s finest achievement yet","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e5fce07e35b992add6d576acc22a1ec863c6033b","amp;dn":"The+Paying+Guests+-+Sarah+Waters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e5fce07e35b992add6d576acc22a1ec863c6033b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,252,224,126,53,185,146,173,214,213,118,172,194,42,30,200,99,198,3,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
