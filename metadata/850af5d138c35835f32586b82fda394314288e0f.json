Hagen\nPublisher:Cambridge University Press | ISBN: 052188974X | 2009 | PDF | 452 pages\n\nThis second, updated edition of the best-selling Radio-Frequency Electronics introduces the basic concepts and key circuits of radio-frequency systems. It covers the fundamental principles applying to all radio devices, from wireless single-chip data transceivers to high-power broadcast transmitters. This new edition is extensively revised and expanded throughout, including additional chapters on radar, digital modulation, GPS navigation, and S-parameter circuit analysis. \n\nNew worked examples and end-of-chapter problems are included to aid and test understanding of the topics covered, as well as numerous extra figures to provide a visual aid to learning. Key topics covered include filters, amplifiers, oscillators, modulators, low-noise amplifiers, phase lock loops, transformers, waveguides, and antennas. Assuming no prior knowledge of radio electronics, this is a perfect introduction to the subject. \n\nIt is an ideal textbook for junior or senior courses in electrical engineering, as well as an invaluable reference for professional engineers in this area.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:850af5d138c35835f32586b82fda394314288e0f","amp;dn":"Radio-Frequency+Electronics+-+Circuits+and+Applications+%282009%29+%28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"850af5d138c35835f32586b82fda394314288e0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,10,245,209,56,195,88,53,243,37,134,184,47,218,57,67,20,40,142,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
