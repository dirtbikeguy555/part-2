The film was a follow-up to &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; (1948) a fantasy/musical/romance/drama set in the world of ballet with the same directors, stars, and production designers.\n\nIn &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot;, Robert Rounsevill stars as E.T.A. (Ernst Theodore Amadeus) Hoffmann, the poet and writer who tells three stories of his great but unhappy loves all ending tragically thanks to the meddling of his enemy, a supernatural villain (Robert Helpmann as quadruple evil, Lindorf, Coppelius, Dapertutto and Dr Miracle). Objects of Hoffmann's love and admiration include Olympia the wind-up doll (Moira Shearer who also plays Stella the dancer, the fourth and yet another Hoffmann's misadventure), Giulietta, the Venetian courtesan who sails away after trying to capture Hoffmann's soul (Ludmilla TchÃƒÂ©rina -absolutely brilliant as the siren and the seductress who elegantly walks over the dead bodies, literally), and Antonia the beautiful opera-singer with the fatal voice and deadly illness. One of the greatest choreographers and dancers of the last century, LÃƒÂ©onide Massine shines in three absolutely different roles demonstrating his talent as a dancer, strong emotions and tremendous humor.\n\nRip Specs (BD Rip)\n\nGeneral           : The Tales Of Hoffmann.1951.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea.mkv\nFormat            : Matroska at 7 144 Kbps\nLength            : 6.64 GiB for 2h 13mn 7s 277ms\n\nVideo #0          : AVC at 6 500 Kbps\nAspect            : 986 x 720 (1.369) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 640 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\nLanguage          : en\n\nText #0           : VobSub\nLanguage          : en\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044103/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044103/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAudio: English\nSubtitles: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddbc1e0e1e444418afcca4fe0577474ff8704ad6","amp;dn":"The+Tales+Of+Hoffmann.1951.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddbc1e0e1e444418afcca4fe0577474ff8704ad6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,188,30,14,30,68,68,24,175,204,164,254,5,119,71,79,248,112,74,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
