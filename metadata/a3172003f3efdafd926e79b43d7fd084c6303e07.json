Stan Getz, Joao Gilberto, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Gil Evans,  Walter Wanderley, Eumir Deodato . . .\n\n\n\n\nTo a Brazilian mother and German father, Astrud Gilberto was born in Bahia, still Brazil's most Africanized state. With her two sisters she grew up in Rio de Janeiro, where she met and married singer-guitarist-songwriter JoÃƒÂ£o Gilberto, one of bossa-nova's originating stylists.\n\n\nShe'd had no professional musical experience of any kind until 1963, the year of her visit to New York with her husband, JoÃƒÂ£o Gilberto, in a recording session headed by Stan Getz. Getz had already recorded several albums influenced by Brazilian rhythms, and Verve teamed him with the cream of Brazilian music, Antonio Carlos Jobim and JoÃƒÂ£o Gilberto, for his next album. Producer Creed Taylor wanted a few English vocals for maximum crossover potential, and as it turned out, Astrud was the only Brazilian present with any grasp of the language. After her husband laid down his Portuguese vocals for the first verse of his and Jobim's composition, &quot;The Girl From Ipanema,&quot; Astrud provided a hesitant, heavily accented second verse in English.\n\n\nNot even credited on the resulting LP, Getz/Gilberto, Astrud finally gained fame over a year later, when &quot;The Girl From Ipanema&quot; became a number five hit in mid-1964. The album became the best-selling jazz album up to that point, and made Gilberto a star across America. Before the end of the year, Verve capitalized on the smash with the release of Getz Au Go Go, featuring a Getz live date with Gilberto's vocals added later. Her first actual solo album, The Astrud Gilberto Album, was released in May 1965. Though it barely missed the Top 40, the LP's blend of Brazilian classics and ballad standards proving quite infectious with easy listening audiences.\n\n\n\nThough she never returned to the pop charts in America, Verve proved to be quite understanding for Astrud Gilberto's career, pairing her with ace arranger Gil Evans for 1966's Look to the Rainbow and Brazilian organist/arranger Walter Wanderley for the dreamy A Certain Smile, a Certain Sadness, released later that year. She remained a huge pop star in Brazil for the rest of the 1960s and '70s, but gradually disappeared in America after her final album for Verve in 1969.\n\n:)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3172003f3efdafd926e79b43d7fd084c6303e07","amp;dn":"This+is+Astrud+Gilberto+-+The+Verve+Years+1964-1969+-+320Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3172003f3efdafd926e79b43d7fd084c6303e07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,23,32,3,243,239,218,253,146,110,121,180,61,127,208,132,198,48,62,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
