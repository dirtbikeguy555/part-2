Formal models are used to present and analyze key ideas and issues. The theoretical analysis is supplemented by examples of relevant empirical work, illustrating the ways that theories can be applied and tested. This well-respected and well-known text is unique in the marketplace.\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIntroduction\n\nChapter 1\n\nTHE SOLOW GROWTH MODEL\n\n1.1\n\nSome Basic Facts about Economic
