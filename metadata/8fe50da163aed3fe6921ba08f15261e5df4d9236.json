This comprehensive reference work profiles over 60 of the most influential designers worldwide, from early leaders of the genre including Peter Behrens to Saul Bass, Neville Brody, and exponents of today's digital technology such as Jonathan Barnbrook. The book also covers the studios and movements that played major roles in the development of modern graphic design history, including early transport posters, Jazz record covers, the 1960s underground press, and the innovative style magazines of the 1980s and '90s. Features on the key design schools such as the Bauhaus and the Cranbrook Academy of Art, make this a complete history of modern graphic design.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fe50da163aed3fe6921ba08f15261e5df4d9236","amp;dn":"Pioneers+Of+Modern+Graphic+Design+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fe50da163aed3fe6921ba08f15261e5df4d9236","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,229,13,161,99,174,211,254,105,33,186,8,241,82,97,229,223,77,146,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
