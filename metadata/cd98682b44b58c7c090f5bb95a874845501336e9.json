Contemporary Italians touch it for luck before placing a bet. Americans are having it cosmetically enhanced at rates approaching breast enlargement surgery. The female butt, tush, culo, or derriÃ¨re has always inspired awe, fantasy, and slavish devotion.\r\nCuriously, its primary purpose is functional rather than aesthetic: butts balance our bodies while running, according to biologists.

Over 400 photos from 1900 to the present day are contextualized by interviews with porn icon John (Buttman) Stagliano, filmmaker Tinto Brass, artist Robert Crumb, bootylicious butt queens Buffie The Body, Coco and Brazil's Watermelon Woman, plus Eve Howard and her life-long spanking obsession","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd98682b44b58c7c090f5bb95a874845501336e9","amp;dn":"The+Big+Butt+Book+by+Dian+Hanson+%28PDF%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd98682b44b58c7c090f5bb95a874845501336e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,152,104,43,68,181,140,124,9,15,91,185,90,135,72,69,80,19,54,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
