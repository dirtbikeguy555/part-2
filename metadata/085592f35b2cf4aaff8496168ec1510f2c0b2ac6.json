This narrative captures the perspectives of leading politicians and war commanders, journalists, civilians, and ordinary soldiers, offering gripping eyewitness accounts of heroism, defeat, suffering, and triumph. \n\nThis is one of the first historical studies of World War II that describes the Holocaust as an integral part of the war. It also covers maneuvers, strategies, and leaders operating in European, Asian, and Pacific theatres. In addition, this book brings in survivor testimonies of occupation, survival behind enemy lines, and the experience of minority groups such as the Roma in Europe, to offer a comprehensive account of the warÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impact on individual lives on both sides. This is a sweeping narrative of one of the most deadly wars in history, which took almost forty million lives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:085592f35b2cf4aaff8496168ec1510f2c0b2ac6","amp;dn":"The+Second+World+War%2C+A+Complete+History+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"085592f35b2cf4aaff8496168ec1510f2c0b2ac6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,85,146,243,91,44,244,170,255,132,150,22,142,193,81,15,44,11,42,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
