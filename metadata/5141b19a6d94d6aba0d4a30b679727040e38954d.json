Originally released that year as a double album, it now remains available on one CD.\n\nBridging his two musical phases together, as a member of The Beatles and a solo artist (similar to George Harrison's earlier The Best of George Harrison), Imagine: John Lennon is a career-spanning collection of Lennon's many musical highlights. In addition there are a couple of heretofore unreleased recordings: an acoustic demo of &quot;Real Love&quot; taped in 1979 (an alternate recording of which would be finished by The Beatles for 1996' s Anthology 2) and a rehearsal take of &quot;Imagine&quot; in mid-1971 before the final take was captured. It also features for the first time a clean-intro version of &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;, that would appear later on the CD release of The Beatles' 1967Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1970 compilation.\n\nImagine: John Lennon, with its wealth of stock Lennon footage and self-narration, proved to be a well-received film and its soundtrack sold well in the US, reaching #31 and going gold. In the UK, the album peaked at #64.\n\nThe project arrived at a timely juncture and was successful in thwarting the then-released The Lives of John Lennon by Albert Goldman, a controversial and reputation-tarnishing book which many dismissed as fiction, including Ono and Lennon's close friends, as well as the remaining Beatles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5141b19a6d94d6aba0d4a30b679727040e38954d","amp;dn":"Imagine+-John+Lennon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5141b19a6d94d6aba0d4a30b679727040e38954d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,65,177,154,109,148,214,171,160,212,163,11,103,151,39,4,14,56,149,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
