They have all been checked on a 42 inch plasma and look great.\n\n\nFarscape (1999Ã¢â‚¬â€œ2003) is an Australian/American science fiction television series, produced originally for the Nine Network. The series was conceived by Rockne S. O'Bannon and produced by Jim Henson Productions and Hallmark Entertainment. The Jim Henson Company was responsible for the various alien make-up and prosthetics, and two regular characters (the animatronic puppets Rygel and Pilot) are entirely Creature Shop creations.\n\nAlthough the series was planned for five seasons, it was abruptly cancelled after production had ended on its fourth season, effectively ending the series on a cliffhanger. Co-producer Brian Henson later secured the rights to Farscape, paving the way for a three-hour miniseries to wrap up the cliffhanger, titled Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars, which Henson directed himself. In 2007, it was announced that the creator was returning for a web-series, but production has been repeatedly put on hold. A comic book miniseries was released in December 2008 that was in continuity with both the series and the hoped-for webisodes.\n\nIn February 2014 it was reported that former series writer Justin Monjo had begun working on a screenplay for a new Farscape movie. At WonderCon 2014, Rockne S. O'Bannon confirmed to Nerdacy that a Farscape movie is in development but the movie is in very early stages.\n\n\n\nPlease seed at a decent speed.\n\nEnjoy,\n\n\nTSV.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9864ca46d0daaa7a4150b844e6b0a64b1fb93d4","amp;dn":"Farscape+Season+1%2C+2%2C+3+%26amp%3B+4+%2B+Extras+BDRip+TSV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9864ca46d0daaa7a4150b844e6b0a64b1fb93d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,134,76,164,109,13,170,167,164,21,11,132,78,107,10,100,177,251,147,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
