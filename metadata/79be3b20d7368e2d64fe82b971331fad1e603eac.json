If you block the communication with\nthe hosts file lines, it won't un-verify the serials.\n\nTo remove the 2 lines in your hosts file later, you will\nneed to copy the %windir%_system32_device_etc_hosts file\nto another non-system directory such as your desktop. Then\nmodify it with a text editor such as notepad. Then copy/replace\nit over the old one.\n\nI have a family member who's new at video editing for youtube\nand I figured I'd share the wealth since this is a fairly new\nrelease of it.\n\nEnjoy,\nmurph","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79be3b20d7368e2d64fe82b971331fad1e603eac","amp;dn":"Camtasia.Studio.v8.4.1.Incl.Keygen-TSZ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79be3b20d7368e2d64fe82b971331fad1e603eac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,190,59,32,215,54,142,45,100,254,130,185,113,51,31,173,30,96,62,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
