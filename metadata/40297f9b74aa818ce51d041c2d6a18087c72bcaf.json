Most of them have lived in Raqqa, ISIL's political and military stronghold in Syria.\r\nPersonal accounts of this sort are extremely rare because, in general, ISIL deserters go into hiding and keep quiet. If they give themselves up to authorities, they are immediately imprisoned and can no longer have any contact with their lawyers or families.\r\nThe smuggling network, made up of long-term fighters of the Free Syrian Army, agreed to reveal a few of its working methods. By helping the deserters to flee and by collecting their testimonies, they want to denounce ISIL's lies, its false promises, its cult of violence and its widespread corruption. The members of the network are convinced that, in doing so, they will discourage future candidates and block recruitment channels.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/29/ISIL-Deserters-Speak-Out-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3f/ISIL-Deserters-Speak-Out-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/88/ISIL-Deserters-Speak-Out-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/be/ISIL-Deserters-Speak-Out-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4d/ISIL-Deserters-Speak-Out-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/58/ISIL-Deserters-Speak-Out-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ad/ISIL-Deserters-Speak-Out-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/61/ISIL-Deserters-Speak-Out-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/34/ISIL-Deserters-Speak-Out-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~1271Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x664\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.93:1\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.50 VBR 48KHz (~112Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 47 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 468 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Embedded English\r\n\r\nLinks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40297f9b74aa818ce51d041c2d6a18087c72bcaf","amp;dn":"Al-Jazeera+Witness+2016+ISIL+Deserters+Speak+Out+720p+x264+AAC+H","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40297f9b74aa818ce51d041c2d6a18087c72bcaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,41,127,155,116,170,129,140,229,29,4,28,45,106,24,8,124,114,188,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
