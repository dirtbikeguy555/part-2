Call the file 7USBEditionByiMortaluz [It won't work if you call it something else!] and press save\n4) Choose the size depending on the size of your usb drive and press resize. Get yourself a cup of coffee, it's going to take long time.\n5) When you boot your new portable windows for the first time - press start menu, type partition and hit enter.
