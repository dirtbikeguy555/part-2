That Mancuso is distantly related to vice cop Joe Morelli - who is trying to beat Stephanie to the punch - only makes the hunt more thrilling...\r\n\r\nTaking pointers from her bounty hunter pal, Ranger, and using her pistol packing Grandma Mazur as a decoy, Stephanie is soon closing in on her mark. But Morelli and his libido are worthy foes. And a more sinister kind of enemy has made his first move... and his next move might be Stephanie's last","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7623e72f9547bcbd643a31fab7eed331da19863e","amp;dn":"Janet+Evanovich-Two+for+the+Dough","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7623e72f9547bcbd643a31fab7eed331da19863e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,35,231,47,149,71,188,189,100,58,49,250,183,238,211,49,218,25,134,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
