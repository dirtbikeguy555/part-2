The Diagnostic Tool Set consists of a set of PC ÃƒÂ¢??based applications which support developers, engineers and technicians in all aspects of communication with ECUs and vehicles via serial communication lines.\n\n&gt; Specification of ECUÃƒÂ¢??s diagnostic data\n&gt; Communication development\n&gt; Reading and clearing error memory\n&gt; Flash data uploading and downloading\n&gt; Reading measurement values\n&gt; Input/output control\n&gt; Calibration of single ECU variables\n&gt; Coding of ECU variables\n&gt; Coding of ECU variants\n&gt; CAN (Controller Area Network) bus mode emulation\n\nSince BMWDT provides solutions for all these use cases it is used within the entire process chain from engineering to test, from manufacturing to after sales. This is done by either directly using one of the highly suited BMWDT applications or by integrating BMWDT into an application specifically development for a distinct task.\n\nCustomer benefits\n&gt; One data set and one run time system for the entire life cycle\n&gt; Reduced maintenance effort and cost reduction\n&gt; Support of all ECU use cases in Engineering, Test, Production and After Sales\n&gt; Automatic generation of specification\n&gt; Integrated solutions for on-board/off-board\n&gt; Fast and simple configuration of GUI and communication data instead of programming\n&gt; Customer specific protocols supported\n&gt; Learn only one system for different projects\n&gt; Open system architecture\n&gt; Proven track record\n&gt; Long term application by supporting widespread ASAM standards\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2fc8d3095b2925411925f47a452c1ba972a7404","amp;dn":"%5BBMW%5DSofting+INPAv5.02+%26+EDIABASv6.47+%28%2BCrack%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2fc8d3095b2925411925f47a452c1ba972a7404","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,252,141,48,149,178,146,84,17,146,95,71,164,82,193,186,151,42,116,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
