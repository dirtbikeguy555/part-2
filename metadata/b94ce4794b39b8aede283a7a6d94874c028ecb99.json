For example, if you decide what food you eat by it&amp;#039;s taste, then you&amp;#039;ve just made an emotional decision. If you decided to choose food by it&amp;#039;s nutritional value then you&amp;#039;ve just made a rational decision. Emotional is always better in the short term, but not in the long term. I&amp;#039;ve cut out chocolate snacks... here&amp;#039;s why:\n\neat banana\ntastes quite nice, gives you a subtle mood lift until lunch. Its healthy (which is good!) and is easily digested.\n\neat chocolate\ntastes brilliant (for the minute it takes you to eat it). Feel really good for 5 minutes, then you have a sugar low and a craving for more. Makes you fat and is not healthy. Will make you feel lethargic until lunch. Chocolate is actually quite addictive and i used to eat it just to satisfy my daily cravings.\n\nYou respect your savory food more if you eat less sugars as well.\nAnyway, this is just me...\n\n\nshare the love brothers and sisters\n\n_Hal440_","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b94ce4794b39b8aede283a7a6d94874c028ecb99","amp;dn":"learn+french+with+michel+thomas+%28advanced%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b94ce4794b39b8aede283a7a6d94874c028ecb99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,76,228,121,75,57,184,174,222,40,58,122,109,148,135,76,2,142,203,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
