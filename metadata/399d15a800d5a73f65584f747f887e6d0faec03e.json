The book contains three sets of comprehensive full-sky maps that cover local space, regional space, and distant space -- with over 20,000 galaxies. All the stereographs have been derived from the most accurate data available, including results from the Hipparcos satellite, and can be used to measure the approximate distances between the objects depicted. The distant space maps represent one of the most complete mappings of the galaxies available to amateur astronomers, and their accompanying three-dimensional views provide tantalising glimpses of structure at the largest scale of the universe","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:399d15a800d5a73f65584f747f887e6d0faec03e","amp;dn":"3-D+Atlas+of+Stars+and+Galaxies+-+1st+Edition+Pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"399d15a800d5a73f65584f747f887e6d0faec03e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,157,21,168,0,213,167,63,101,88,79,116,127,136,126,109,15,174,192,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
