Active throughout the 1990s and up until 2005, the band re-formed in 2011. The Tea Party released eight albums on EMI Music Canada, selling 1.6 million records worldwide, and achieving a No. 1 Canadian single &quot;Heaven Coming Down&quot; in 1999.\n\nThe Tea Party toured Canada on twenty-one occasions and Australia on twelve. In November 2002, the band toured Canada with symphony orchestras reinterpreting a decade's worth of shared songwriting. Breaking up in 2005 due to creative differences, band members nevertheless re-united in 2011 to play several Canadian tour dates during the summer. The band decided to continue after the tour and has now re-formed. The band has since released a double live album, recorded on their 2012 tour of Australia. Video shot during this tour was released as a Live DVD/Blu-ray, &quot;The Tea Party: Live From Australia&quot; in 2013. The Tea Party has also been writing and recording new original material since Fall 2012, and their new album, The Ocean at the End, will be released in September 2014.Tracklisting\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.
