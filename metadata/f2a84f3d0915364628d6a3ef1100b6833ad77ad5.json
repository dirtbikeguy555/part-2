Could offer a small indication of what The Endless River will be like. Beo.\n\nSecret Rarities - Rev.A is a great record with remastering of songs previously released, and the big surprise are the new tracks (2, 11, 13, 14 and 15), unpublished.\n\nTracks 1, 3, 5 and 6 come from a tape that &quot;David Gilmour&quot; has brought the BBC Radio One Studios on July 28, 1992, during his interview with Nick Horne (promoting the box set &quot;Shine On&quot; / 9 CDs). They are a pre-FM source, sounding much better than previous versions. This compilation also includes versions of &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; (track 2) and &quot;Learning To Fly&quot; (track 4) derived from stereo FM broadcast (&quot;The Dogs of War&quot; and &quot;Signs of Life&quot; were also included but not were broadcast during the BBC program).\n\nThe most important are the four demo Untitled, 1993 (tracks 7-10), which appeared a few months ago and are unpublished. Form an instrumental ensemble 11 minutes. These outtakes probably come from the first tests of the album &quot;The Division Bell&quot;. It is assumed that the first intention of the band was to compose a long instrumental piece with &quot;Cluster One&quot; preceding &quot;Marooned&quot;, followed by a third part with percussions. The third would have been discarded in the final version of the album. The original source was almost inaudible being expertly remastered by MOB, you can still hear some kind of noise or surface saturation at higher frequencies.\n\nThe launch of This Place Records are contemplating the 20th anniversary of &quot;The Division Bell&quot;, understood to be a perfect time to share these updated bringing news and oddities. Surely thankful. Good listening!  \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2a84f3d0915364628d6a3ef1100b6833ad77ad5","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+-+Secret+Rarities+%282014%29+FLAC+Beolab1700","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2a84f3d0915364628d6a3ef1100b6833ad77ad5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,168,79,61,9,21,54,70,40,214,163,239,17,0,182,131,58,215,122,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
