Barbara Oakley is to be commended upon looking so hard, and so closely, at the motives, in some, that underlie acts of 'kindness' and 'altruism'Ã¢â‚¬â€suggesting that things are not always as they appear, and the phrase 'killed with kindness' springs from the absolute bedrock of folk wisdom.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Joyce Carol Oates, National Book Award winner\n\nPraise for Pathological Altruism:\n\n&quot;What a wonderful book! This is one of the few books in evolutionary biology I've read in the past ten years that taught me something completely new.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Edward O.  Wilson, Pulitzer Prize Winner and Pellegrino University Research Professor Emeritus, Harvard University\n\n&quot;This unique volume manages the impressive feat of pulling together the best research from psychology, genetics, neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and law on well-meaning but ultimately harmful forms of self-sacrifice. It will forever change the way you look at altruism.&quot;\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Sharon Begley, Science Editor, Newsweek, and author of Train Your Mind, Change Your Brain\nProduct Description\nWhether you are a student struggling to fulfill a math or science requirement, or you are embarking on a career change that requires a higher level of math competency, A Mind for Numbers offers the tools you need to get a better grasp of that intimidating but inescapable field. Engineering professor Barbara Oakley knows firsthand how it feels to struggle with math. She flunked her way through high school math and science courses, before enlisting in the army immediately after graduation. When she saw how her lack of mathematical and technical savvy severely limited her optionsÃ¢â‚¬â€both to rise in the military and to explore other careersÃ¢â‚¬â€she returned to school with a newfound determination to re-tool her brain to master the very subjects that had given her so much trouble throughout her entire life.\n\nIn A Mind for Numbers, Dr. Oakley lets us in on the secrets to effectively learning math and scienceÃ¢â‚¬â€secrets that even dedicated and successful students wish theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d known earlier. Contrary to popular belief, math requires creative, as well as analytical, thinking. Most people think that thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only one way to do a problem, when in actuality, there are often a number of different solutionsÃ¢â‚¬â€you just need the creativity to see them. For example, there are more than three hundred different known proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem. In short, studying a problem in a laser-focused way until you reach a solution is not an effective way to learn math. Rather, it involves taking the time to step away from a problem and allow the more relaxed and creative part of the brain to take over. A Mind for Numbers shows us that we all have what it takes to excel in math, and learning it is not as painful as some might think! \n\nPage Numbers Source ISBN: 039916524X\nPublisher: Tarcher (31 July 2014)\nSold by: Amazon Digital Services, Inc.\nLanguage: English\nASIN: B00G3L19ZU","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e548015e5f1ddc0824d31edc5115590ffdfa50e","amp;dn":"%5BBarbara+Oakley%5DA+Mind+For+Numbers+How+to+Excel+at+Math+and+Scie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e548015e5f1ddc0824d31edc5115590ffdfa50e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,84,128,21,229,241,221,192,130,77,49,237,197,17,85,144,255,223,165,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
