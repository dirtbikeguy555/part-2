He rents a house in the West Egg district of Long Island, a wealthy but unfashionable area populated by the new rich, a group who have made their fortunes too recently to have established social connections and who are prone to garish displays of wealth. Nick?s next-door neighbor in West Egg is a mysterious man named Jay Gatsby, who lives in a gigantic Gothic mansion and throws extravagant parties every Saturday night.\n\n\nPlease seed 1:1\t\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bdd74656595b66ca16fcddb582065065dd92d97","amp;dn":"F.+Scott+Fitzgerald+-+The+Great+Gatsby","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bdd74656595b66ca16fcddb582065065dd92d97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,221,116,101,101,149,182,108,161,111,205,219,88,32,101,6,93,217,45,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
