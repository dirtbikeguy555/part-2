With its comprehensive coverage, easy-to-use layout and visual impact, it should appeal to bird enthusiasts of all ages and levels of experience. The book opens with an introduction that offers a portrait of birds and their habitats. Covering evolution, anatomy and behaviour, it also describes how birds have adapted to different environments - from wetlands and rocky coasts to woodland and urban gardens. The 320 species most commonly seen in Britain and Europe have full-page coverage, comprising of a large photograph of each bird in its most frequently observed plumage with supporting images showing the most important plumage variations: adult/juvenile; male/female; and winter/summer. Additional illustrations reveal the characteristic appearance of each bird in flight, while &quot;in situ&quot; views portray a range of behaviours and habits. Similar-looking species and subspecies are also pictured, for comparison. In each species profile, key features are highlighted by annotation around each picture and further details of voice, nesting, feeding, migration, habitat, nomenclature, physical statistics, social grouping, behaviour, lifespan and conservation status are presented in jargon-free text. Distribution is shown in colour-coded maps. In addition to the main species, over 200 less common and peripheral birds are also illustrated and described, while a further 276 very rare and introduced species are concisely profiled","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a1f27c2d32fb89edee1a3c3ac5de2eb6a451f78","amp;dn":"RSPB+Complete+Birds+of+Britain+and+Europe+%282002%29+Pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a1f27c2d32fb89edee1a3c3ac5de2eb6a451f78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,31,39,194,211,47,184,158,222,225,163,195,172,93,226,235,106,69,31,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
