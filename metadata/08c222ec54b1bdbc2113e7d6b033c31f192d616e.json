Wayne Bequette (Prentice Hall, 1998).pdf\n\nISBN 0132068893\n\nModeling, analysis and simulation of chemical processes is increasingly central to the work of chemical engineers -- but it is rarely covered in depth in process design guides. This book fills that gap. It is a comprehensive introduction to process modeling and dynamics using the powerful MATLAB and SIMULINK analysis tools.Start by understanding the rationale for process modeling, and why it is becoming so critically important. Then, review all the fundamental numerical techniques involved, including algebraic equations and numerical integration. Walk through linear systems analysis in detail, learning how to linearize non-linear models, solve linear nth Order ODE models, work with Laplace transforms and transfer function analysis, and much more. Finally, learn how to use today's increasingly-important non-linear techniques, such as phase plane analysis, quadratic maps bifurcation behavior, and analysis of chaotic behavior via Lorenz equations.For all chemical engineers, from Ph.D. professionals to non-degreed technicians and students","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08c222ec54b1bdbc2113e7d6b033c31f192d616e","amp;dn":"Process+Dynamics+-+Modeling%2C+Analysis%2C+and+Simulation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08c222ec54b1bdbc2113e7d6b033c31f192d616e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,194,34,236,84,177,189,188,33,19,231,214,176,51,195,31,25,45,97,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
