These fans turned the Smiths into stars in Britain, exerting tremendous pull over much of the country's guitar-based music for many years after their breakup, and even if the group remained underground cult artists in the States, they had a fan base that slowly, steadily grew larger over the years. Indeed, a few years after the Smiths' breakup in 1987, Morrissey's American cult had grown to the point where he became more popular in the U.S. than in his homeland, where he nevertheless was never far from the music press headlines. After a quiet period around the turn of the millennium, Morrissey launched a comeback in 2004 with You Are the Quarry, an album whose success proved that he remained one of the most beloved figures in alternative rock.\n\nGenre................: Alternative-Rock\nYear.................: 2014\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, Audiochecker\n\n\n\n01.World Peace Is None Of Your Business\n02.Neal Cassady Drops Dead\n03.I'm Not A Man\n04.Istanbul\n05.Earth Is The Loneliest Planet\n06.Staircase At The University\n07.The Bullfighter Dies\n08.Kiss Me A Lot\n09.Smiler With Knife\n10.Kick The Bride Down The Aisle\n11.Mountjoy\n12.Oboe Concerto\n13.Scandinavia (Bonus Track)\n14.One Of Our Own (Bonus Track)\n15.Drag The River (Bonus Track)\n16.Forgive Someone (Bonus Track)\n17.Julie In The Weeds (Bonus Track)\n18.Art-Hounds (Bonus Track)\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\nBuy it if you like it!\n\nThanks for Seeding\nCheers...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a074f1780ae3f56cd71554b000dc1f2511341f4f","amp;dn":"Morrissey+-+World+Peace+Is+None+Of+Your+Business+2014+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a074f1780ae3f56cd71554b000dc1f2511341f4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,116,241,120,10,227,245,108,215,21,84,176,0,220,31,37,17,52,31,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
