Dark  Souls  is  a  spiritual\nsuccessor to Demon's, not a sequel. Prepare  for  a\nnew,   despair-inducing   world,   with   a   vast,\nfully-explorable  horizon  and  vertically-oriented\nlandforms. Prepare for  a  new,  mysterious  story,\ncentered around the the world of Lodran,  but  most\nof all, prepare to die.  You  will  face  countless\nmurderous traps, countless  darkly  grotesque  mobs\nand several gargantuan, supremely  powerful  demons\nand dragons bosses. You must learn  from  death  to\npersist through this  unforgiving  world.  And  you\naren't alone. Dark  Souls  allows  the  spirits  of\nother players to show up in your world, so you  can\nlearn from their deaths and  they  can  learn  from\nyours. You can also summon players into your  world\nto co-op adventure, or invade other's worlds to PVP\nbattle. New to Dark Souls are Bonfires, which serve\nas check points as you fight your way through  this\nepic adventure.
