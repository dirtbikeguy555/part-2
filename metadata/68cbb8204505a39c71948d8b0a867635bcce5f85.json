The singer/songwriter co-produced the record with his longtime bandmate, guitarist Noah Georgeson. Banhart's eighth studio album, Mala was recorded in his then-home in Los Angeles. He and Georgeson played most of the instruments themselves, using borrowed equipment and a vintage Tascam recorder they d found in a pawn shop. &quot;A lot of early hip-hop had been made on [the Tascam], &quot; says Banhart. &quot;And knowing my songs are not hip-hop whatsoever, we thought it would be interesting to see how these kinds of songs would sound on equipment that was used to record our favorite rap. Let s see how this technology would work for us. &quot; It was a new approach for the pair. &quot;In the past we were more like, let s use the oldest equipment we could find. &quot;\n\nBanhart also notes how his voice has developed over the years: &quot;I don t really take care of my voice, but, just like with playing guitar, you get more familiar with it, and you get better at it. I ve always said that I m very good at not knowing how to play the guitar but, really, it s just that I m very comfortable with the utter uncertainty of my approach. &quot; Banhart s previous release, 2009 s What Will We Be, received critical acclaim, with Rolling Stone calling it &quot;the best he s ever made. &quot; The Los Angeles Times said the record &quot;found him making comfortable, laid-back folk that didn t sound like a compromise more like an artist growing into his own. &quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68cbb8204505a39c71948d8b0a867635bcce5f85","amp;dn":"Devendra+Banhart+-+Mala+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68cbb8204505a39c71948d8b0a867635bcce5f85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,203,184,32,69,5,163,156,113,148,141,139,10,134,118,53,188,206,95,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
