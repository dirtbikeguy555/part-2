But with his latest album his superior vocals are also at the forefront. Haynes' bold and emotive delivery, shimmering with his smoky vibrato is not to be missed. The album features Ivan Neville on organ and background vocals, Ian McLagan on piano, Ruthie Foster on background vocals, George Porter Jr. on bass and Ron Holloway on saxophone. The album was recorded live in studio to capture all of the emotion, passion and spontaneity at Willie Nelson's Pedernales Studios on two-inch tape with vintage tube microphones.\n\n\nYou wouldn't know it from listening to Warren Haynes' work with Gov't Mule or the Allman Brothers Band, but there was a time when he didn't play guitar. He says, &quot;I didn't get my first guitar until I was 12. My oldest brother had an acoustic guitar and I would bang around on it and try to play.&quot; But guitar wasn't even his first love -- it was singing. Around the time he was eight or nine, Haynes' two older brothers began turning him on to soul music. He would sit in his room, singing Smokey Robinson, Diana Ross, Otis Redding, and Wilson Pickett. He became fascinated with sounds of Motown and Memphis. &quot;All I cared about was the singer. The really strong singers really knocked me out. Levi Stubbs of the Four Tops still is one of my favorite voices of all time. And I always liked B.B. King even before I liked the blues. His voice was the main thing.&quot; \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\nDisc One\n\n01.Man In Motion\n02.River's Gonna Rise\n03.Everyday Will Be Like A Holiday\n04.Sick Of My Shadow\n05.Your Wildest Dreams\n\n\nDisc Two\n\n01.On A Real Lonely Night\n02.Hattiesburg Hustle\n03.A Friend To You\n04.Take A Bullet\n05.Save Me\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4a8f579da7ea2555813fa4182a47f060d4a37e1","amp;dn":"%2AADVANCE+%2A+Warren+Haynes+-+Man+In+Motion+%282011%29+mp3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4a8f579da7ea2555813fa4182a47f060d4a37e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,168,245,121,218,126,162,85,88,19,250,65,130,164,127,6,13,74,55,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
