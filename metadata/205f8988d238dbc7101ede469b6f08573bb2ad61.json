Now Peavey has updated and improved the modeling engine in ReValver 4, taking amp modeling to a whole new level of realistic tone-shaping possibilities. ReValver 4 also incorporates a GUI and UX redesign and the ability to run on a WindowsÃ‚Â® tablet, plus other high-level features including GIG mode, ACTÃ¢â€žÂ¢ (Audio Cloning Technology) and RIR 2 cabinet modeling.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nN0TES:\nRead NFO please, some important, uh, infos inside.\nYour dear copylefter wasted half of last night decrypting and resaving all\nfactory preset, so you lil preset addict won't complain. You owe me a favor   \nPreset created on cracked version won't work on legit and vice-versa, \nno way around this as legit presets are encrypted with RSA1024.\nLive with it. Or just buy it, they dropped price a lot since v3.5, it's worth the money   \n\nFiX N0TES:\nI missed an encryption call in first release, it won't save noise gate and pickup settings. Now everything works.\n\ncopylefter\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ndemonoid.pw\n1337x.to\nthepiratebay.se\nflashtorrents.org\nbtdigg.org\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXV (03)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:205f8988d238dbc7101ede469b6f08573bb2ad61","amp;dn":"Peavey+Electronics+Revalver+IV+OS+X+%5BFiXED%5D%5BC0PYL3FT3R%5D%5Bdada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"205f8988d238dbc7101ede469b6f08573bb2ad61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,95,137,136,210,56,219,199,16,30,222,70,155,111,8,87,59,178,173,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
