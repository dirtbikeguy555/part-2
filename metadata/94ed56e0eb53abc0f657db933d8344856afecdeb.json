Tutor to the emperor Nero, Seneca was one of the most influential of all classical Latin writers, and the only tragic playwright from ancient Rome whose work survives.  Works attributed to him include a dozen philosophical essays, one hundred and twenty-four letters dealing with moral issues, nine tragedies, and a satire, the attribution of which is disputed.\n\nSeneca generally employed a pointed rhetorical style.  His writings expose traditional themes of Stoic philosophy: the universe is governed for the best by a rational providence; contentment is achieved through a simple, unperturbed life in accordance with nature and duty to the state; human suffering should be accepted and has a beneficial effect on the soul; study and learning are important.  He emphasized practical steps by which the reader might confront life's problems.  In particular, he considered it important to confront one's own mortality.  The discussion of how to approach death dominates many of his letters.\n\nHis letters are powerful moral essays that also yield illuminating insight into Seneca's personal life and the turbulent times in which he lived.  They include literary discussions, moral exhortation, exemplary heroes and episodes from Roman history, and a lurid picture of contemporary luxury.\n\nSeneca's dramas also depict the uncertain, oppressive, and violent conditions of his day.  Rape, suicide, child-murder, incestuous love, madness, and mutilation afflict the characters, who are obsessed and destroyed by their feelings.  Seneca forces us to think about the difference between compromise and hypocrisy, about what happens when emotions overwhelm judgment, and about how a person can be good, calm, or happy in a corrupt society and under constant threat of death.  His plays were widely read in medieval and Renaissance European universities and strongly influenced tragic drama in that time, including Elizabethan England (Shakespeare) and France (Corneille and Racine).\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format unless otherwise indicated:\n\n* ANGER, MERCY, REVENGE (Chicago, 2010).
