Directed by Doug Pray (SURFWISE, SCRATCH,         \n           HYPE!), it reveals the work and wisdom of some of the          \n           most influential advertising creatives of our time --          \n           people who've profoundly impacted our culture, yet are         \n           virtually unknown outside their industry. Exploding forth      \n           from advertising's &quot;creative revolution&quot; of the 1960s,         \n           these artists and writers all brought a surprisingly           \n           rebellious spirit to their work in a business more often       \n           associated with mediocrity or manipulation: George Lois,       \n           Mary Wells, Dan Wieden, Lee Clow, Hal Riney and others         \n           featured in ART &amp; COPY were responsible for &quot;Just Do It,&quot;      \n           &quot;I Love NY,&quot; &quot;Where's the Beef?,&quot; &quot;Got Milk,&quot; &quot;Think           \n           Different,&quot; and brilliant campaigns for everything from        \n           cars to presidents. They managed to grab the attention of      \n           millions and truly move them. Visually interwoven with         \n           their stories, TV satellites are launched, billboards are      \n           erected, and the social and cultural impact of their ads       \n           are brought to light in this dynamic exploration of art,       \n           commerce, and human emotion.                                   \n                                                                          \n                                                    \n                        \n                            \n                                 \n                                                                          \n           Lee Clow................... : ....................Himself      \n           Jim Durfee................. : ....................Himself      \n           Cliff Freeman.............. : ....................Himself      \n           Jeff Goodby................ : ....................Himself      \n           David Kennedy.............. : ....................Himself      \n           George Lois................ : ....................Himself      \n           Charlie Moss............... : ....................Himself      \n           Hal Riney.................. : ....................Himself      \n           Phyllis K.
