Half-Life went on to win over 50 &quot;Game of The Year&quot; awards from various publications and spawned a variety of successful modifications, add-ons, and mission packs. Today, Half-Life is still by far the most popular first person shooter online.\nIn Half-Life, you take on the role of Gordon Freeman, an innocent scientist who gets caught in the middle of a government experiment that goes tragically wrong, flooding the Black Mesa Research Facility with aliens and monsters. Fortunately, the government sends in the Marines. Unfortunately, they want to wipe out everything, including you. \nÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡  \nHalf-Life: Source is the very same game but imported into Half-Life 2's Source engine. It won't be seeing as much of an extensive overhaul as Counter-Strike has. It will be more of a direct port so the level geometry, textures, sounds and models will remain wholly unchanged from the original, however, all of these old graphics will benefit greatly from all of the latest features in the Source engine including some shader effects (such as realistic water), dynamic lighting and shadow effects and full use of the Havok physics engine and rag-doll physics. \n\nJust imagine that classic Half-Life game play and engrossing storyline, but every time you throw a hand grenade at a grunt, instead of him acting out a generic death animation (and probably clipping through the wall), he hurtles through the air realistically and bounces to the ground, or shooting the crossbow at a grunt and watch him be impaled on the nearest wall. It may not be all that different from the original Half-Life, but it's sure going to be fun... \n\nFor further information visit our forums: www.digitalzone.eu.tt\n\nEnjoY!\n\nNext Release Is Team Fortress Classic!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:374fe6e82694475d5682250c76474a2d5b7bab45","amp;dn":"%5BPC-Non-Steam%5D+Half-life+Source+%5BDIGITALZONE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"374fe6e82694475d5682250c76474a2d5b7bab45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,79,230,232,38,148,71,93,86,130,37,12,118,71,74,45,91,123,171,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
