Houston of PASTE MAGAZINE describes THE BALLAD OF GENESIS AND LADY JAYE as 'a rave party (the fictional kind that only plays fantastic music).... It is also an EXCEEDINGLY GOOD movie... with its brilliant score, remarkable imagery and explosive, vibrant tone.' The Playlist at indieWIRE gives the film an 'A-': 'ultimately a deeply felt, albeit odd, love storyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ an engrossing depiction of two individuals, who happen to be non-conformists unafraid to go beyond love.' And Neil Mitchell of ELECTRIC SHEEP MAGAZINE writes, 'You'll be hard-pushed to find a more strikingly candid, and unexpectedly moving, portrait of life, love, and creativity of the experimental end of the rock'n'roll spectrum.'\n\nWinner of the TEDDY and CALIGARI FILM AWARDS at the Forum in the Berlin International Film Festival, the documentary went on to pick up several more awards following its world premiere in Germany: the GRAND PRIZE, IndieLisboa  (Portugal); PRIX LOUIS MARCORELLES  and PRIX DES BIBLIOTHEQUES, Cinema du Reel (Paris, France); AUDIENCE AWARD, Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema/BAFICI (Argentina); ARTISTIC ACHIEVEMENT AWARD, Outfest Film Festival (Los Angeles, USA); SPECIAL MENTION, International Competition, Santiago Festival Internacional de Cine/SANFIC (Chile); and AUDIENCE AWARD, Special Mention, Festival du Nouveau Cinema (Montreal, Quebec).\n\nU.S.A.. 2011. 70 min.
