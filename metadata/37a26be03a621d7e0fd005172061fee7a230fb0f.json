But this voice keeps whispering in my other ear; tells me I may never seed this again. But i get a peaceful easy feeling and I know you won't let me down. \n\nPlease seed.\n\nThe MP3 tags have been edited so one Album cover will display with Disc 1 and Disc 2 inside. The factory default shows two seperate albums for this one collection. I hope you find you single album view cleaner in appearance\n\n- Big Papi\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nBy Peter\n\nThere have been Eagles compilations before but this by far the best. It contains all the songs that could be found on earlier British and American compilations, plus a few songs never before included on any of them. And everything has been digitally re-mastered, sounding better than ever.\n\nAll the famous songs are here including Desperado, Take it to the limit, Lying eyes, Hotel California, Tequila sunrise, New kid in town and Best of my love to name just a few.\n\nAside from the obvious songs, you also get Please come home for Christmas (a song that has since become a standard), two songs from their Hell freezes over album (Love will keep us alive and Get over it), their recently recorded Hole in the world and several great album tracks, of which I particularly like Midnight flyer and Victim of love. A nice booklet with extensive liner notes is also included.\n\nIf you only buy one Eagles collection, make it this one. It has everything that most people will ever need, although there are still plenty of interesting songs on the original albums that couldn't be included.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nEagles - The Very Best Of\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFLAC:\nArtist...............: Eagles\nAlbum................: The Very Best Of\nGenre................: Pop/Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2003\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 63 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\nMP3 V0 (Best Quality Available for MP3)\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 267kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
