He is assigned a very unorthodox partner named Naomi Armitage, who seems to have links to the victims. To stir things up more, every victim is found to be an illegally made third-generation android, built to be almost perfect replications of humans. It becomes a race against time when the government attempts to cover up the existence of the 'Third Types', and eliminate the only ones with the evidence. And even more importantly, why are the Thirds created to be so similar to humans, even to the extent of being indistinguishable from them on every level, mentally and biologically?\n\nPart 1: Electro Blood, ~50 minutes\nPart 2: Flesh and Stone, ~30 minutes\nPart 3: Heart Core, ~30 minutes\nPart 4: Bit of Love, ~30 minutes\n\n720x480 @ 29.97 fps\n1043 kbps, DX50 codec (DivX 5/6)\n128 kbps Stereo MP3, Dual Audio (Eng+Jap)\nExt.

Watch the OAVs in order first as the &quot;first movie&quot;, then move on to Dual-Matrix, and you haven't missed a beat. The subtitles don't &quot;exactly&quot; match up to the English, they're meant for the secondary Japanese audio, though they're mostly close enough to still use for the English.\n\nAll files have been thoroughly tested on a standalone DivX player.\n\nEnjoy... +*halofubar*+ ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0eafe607c86be44f8a7502cb72d36cc88f23051","amp;dn":"%5BDivX%5D+Armitage+III+%28the+Third%29+%2B+Armitage+III%3A+Dual-Matrix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0eafe607c86be44f8a7502cb72d36cc88f23051","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,234,254,96,124,134,190,68,248,167,80,44,183,45,54,204,136,242,48,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
