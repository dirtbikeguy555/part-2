So i had to disable my last plugin, which i hadn't expected to affect games THAT much. And it was macrofire.prx. I don't know if this particular plugin is the problem itself, maybe this game is just allergic to any plugins. So if having problems remember to try and disable your game-plugins and see how it goes. Good luck playing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91802798d8154f6cfaa82b2412270c3bdc204316","amp;dn":"%5BPSP%5DBakugan+Battle+Brawlers%3A+Defenders+of+the+Core%5BENG%5D%5BFULL%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91802798d8154f6cfaa82b2412270c3bdc204316","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,128,39,152,216,21,79,108,250,168,43,36,18,39,12,59,220,32,67,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
