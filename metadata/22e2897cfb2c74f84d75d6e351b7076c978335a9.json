It starts as mid-level drug dealer, D'Angelo Barksdale beats a murder rap. After a conversation with a judge, Det. James McNulty has been assigned to lead a joint homicide and narcotics team, in order to bring down drug kingpin Avon Barksdale. Avon Barksdale, accompanied by his right-hand man Stringer Bell, enforcer Wee-Bey and many lieutenants (including his own nephew, D'Angelo Barksdale), has to deal with law enforcement, informants in his own camp, and competition with a local rival, Omar, who's been robbing Barksdale's dealers and reselling the drugs. The supervisor of the investigation, Lt. Cedric Daniels, has to deal with his own problems, such as a corrupt bureaucracy, some of his detectives beating suspects, hard-headed but determined Det. McNulty, and a blackmailing deputy. The show depicts the lives of every part of the drug &quot;food chain&quot;, from junkies to dealers, and from cops to politicians.\n\nScreenshots:\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22e2897cfb2c74f84d75d6e351b7076c978335a9","amp;dn":"The+Wire+Season+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22e2897cfb2c74f84d75d6e351b7076c978335a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,226,137,124,251,44,116,248,77,117,214,227,81,183,7,108,151,131,53,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
