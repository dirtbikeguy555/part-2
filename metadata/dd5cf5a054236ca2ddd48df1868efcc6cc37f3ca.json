This will be the first Premier League match between United boss Jose Mourinho and City manager Pep Guardiola. The pair were bitter rivals during their time together in Spanish football as coaches of Real Madrid and Barcelona respectively. And with both United and City expected to be amongst the title challengers this season, there's plenty at stake as the sides meet at Old Trafford. Champions Leicester face a testing trip to Liverpool, while last season's runners-up Arsenal take on a Southampton side that finished sixth in May. Elsewhere, Bournemouth host West Brom, Burnley meet Hull, Middlesbrough play Crystal Palace, Stoke clash with Tottenham and West Ham face Watford","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd5cf5a054236ca2ddd48df1868efcc6cc37f3ca","amp;dn":"Match+of+the+Day+10th+September+2016","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd5cf5a054236ca2ddd48df1868efcc6cc37f3ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,92,245,160,84,35,108,162,221,212,141,241,134,142,252,198,204,55,243,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
