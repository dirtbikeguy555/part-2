But since this episodic game is not updated by patches, it's not a problem. The game works just fine with resources decrypted/uncompressed, no problems here.\n    NOTHING ripped, game resources were decrypted &amp; unpacked\n    Significantly smaller archive size (compressed from 3,1 to 1,7 GB)\n    Installation takes 2-3 minutes\n    HDD space after installation: 7 GB\n    Repack by FitGirl\n\n\nCredits to FitGirl on KAT","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:700019a1acd6b697b4add36d2d86d4836ff8b644","amp;dn":"Game+of+Thrones+Episodes+1+%26amp%3B+2+%5BFitGirl+Repack%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"700019a1acd6b697b4add36d2d86d4836ff8b644","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,0,25,161,172,214,182,151,180,173,211,109,45,134,212,131,111,248,182,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
