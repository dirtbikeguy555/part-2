Instead he was a budding genius who lived a clean life, but still died young, aged 25. He died in a car crash and wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t even behind the wheel. Seems that the spirit of jazz was gonna get him anyway.\n\n\n\nThis excellent album features tenor saxophonist Harold Land, pianist Richie Powell and bassist George Morrow. Max Roach accompanies the group brilliantly on drums, and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hard bop to the max, courtesy of one band that could have reached the heights in time. Now you can learn what all the fuss was about.\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist\n\n\n\n\n\n1 Cherokee (5:44)\n2 Jacqui (5:11)\n3 Swingin' (2:52)\n4 Land's End (4:56)\n5 George's Dilemma (5:36)\n6 Sandu (4:56)\n7 Gerkin for Perkin (2:56)\n8 If I Love Again (3:24)\n9 Take the &quot;A&quot; Train (4:18)\n\n\n\nRecorded on February 23, 1955\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorge Morrow - Bass\nRichie Powell - Piano\nClifford Brown - Trumpet\nHarold Land - Sax (Tenor)\nMax Roach - Drums\n\n\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c87d2ba1f1b3ba54b4d3f6069c1cf3a86b2d9bf","amp;dn":"Clifford+Brown+%26+Max+Roach+-+Study+in+Brown+%281955%29+%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c87d2ba1f1b3ba54b4d3f6069c1cf3a86b2d9bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,135,210,186,31,27,59,165,75,77,63,96,105,193,207,58,134,178,217,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
