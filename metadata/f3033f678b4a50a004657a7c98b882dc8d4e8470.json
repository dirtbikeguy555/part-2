Originally comprised of RÃƒÂ©gine Chassagne, Richard Parry, Tim Kingsbury, and brothers William and Win Butler, the group formed during the summer of 2003, after Win spotted Chassagne singing jazz standards at a Montreal art exhibit. The grandson of famed swing-era bandleader Alvino Rey, Win was quickly charmed by Chassagne's performance, leading the two to launch a songwriting partnership. Romance followed shortly thereafter, and the duo expanded its sound by gathering Parry on organ, Kingsbury on bass, and Win Butler's younger brother, William, on synthesizer and percussion. Drawing from the bandmates' varied influences, Arcade Fire began mining an eclectic mix of bossa nova, punk, French chanson, and classically tinged pop music, referencing everything from U2's passion to David Bowie's eclecticism in the process.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3033f678b4a50a004657a7c98b882dc8d4e8470","amp;dn":"Arcade+Fire+-+Reflektor+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3033f678b4a50a004657a7c98b882dc8d4e8470","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,3,63,103,139,74,80,160,4,101,122,124,152,184,130,220,141,78,132,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
