Generally a protest-minded Rastafarian outfit, Steel Pulse started out playing authentic roots reggae with touches of jazz and Latin music, and earned a substantial audience among white U.K. punks as well. Their 1978 debut, Handsworth Revolution, is still regarded by many critics as a landmark and a high point of British reggae. As the '80s wore on, slick synthesizers and elements of dance and urban R&amp;B gradually crept into their sound, even as their subject matter stayed on the militant side. By the late '80s, Steel Pulse had won a Grammy and were working full-fledged crossover territory, but never reached the same degree of commercial acceptance as Aswad or Inner Circle. They subsequently returned to a tough-minded, rootsy sound that nonetheless made concessions to contemporary trends with touches of dancehall and hip-hop.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tReggae\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n\n01.Handsworth Revolution\n02.Soldiers\n03.Ku Klux Klan\n04.Sound System\n05.Babylon Makes The Rules\n06.Drug Squad\n07.Heart Of Stone (Chant Them)\n08.Reggae Fever\n09.Ravers\n10.State Of Emergency\n11.Can't Stand It\n12.Taxi Driver\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40fb7e19d94566a8c413f9354a1e359a2b5d0c40","amp;dn":"Steel+Pulse+-+The+Best+Of+Steel+Pulse+%282004%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40fb7e19d94566a8c413f9354a1e359a2b5d0c40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,251,126,25,217,69,102,168,196,19,249,53,74,30,53,154,43,93,12,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
