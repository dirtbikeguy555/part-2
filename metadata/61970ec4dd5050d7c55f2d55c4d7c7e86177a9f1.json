It contains the latest fundamental research results in this field. While existing books are often more oriented toward Masters students, this book is aimed more towards professors and researchers as it contains more advanced subjects.\nIt is unique in the sense that it contains information that has not previously been covered by other books in the field, with chapters on phase ordering in optimizing compilation; register saturation in instruction level parallelism; code size reduction for software pipelining; memory hierarchy effects and instruction level parallelism.\n\nOther chapters provide the latest research results in well-known topics such as register need, and software pipelining and periodic register allocation","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61970ec4dd5050d7c55f2d55c4d7c7e86177a9f1","amp;dn":"Advanced+Backend+Optimization+%28DjShay12%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61970ec4dd5050d7c55f2d55c4d7c7e86177a9f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,151,14,196,221,80,80,215,197,95,45,85,196,215,199,232,97,119,169,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
