Now, in The Lean Mindset, the Poppendiecks take the next step, looking at a company where multidiscipline teams are expected to ask the right questions, solve the right problems, and deliver solutions that customers love.\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c63cc156f8d84f0940bae9dce55e223f17453b7","amp;dn":"The+Lean+Mindset%3A+Ask+the+Right+Questions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c63cc156f8d84f0940bae9dce55e223f17453b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,99,204,21,111,141,132,240,148,11,174,157,206,85,226,35,241,116,83,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
