Project Reality installs alongside your existing Battlefield 2 game installation, allowing both the original game and Project Reality to be played separately without conflict.\n\nProject Reality reworks Battlefield 2, developed by Digital Illusions of Sweden (DICE), to create the most realistic and demanding virtual combat environment for PC gamers possible. This process has included everything from making dramatic improvements to Battlefield 2's already esteemed visual and sound effects to perfecting a true-to-life ballistics system that immerses the player in the battlefield like no other shooter can. Project Reality also drastically ups the scale of the original Battlefield 2 by featuring vast and exceptionally detailed battlegrounds as large as 64 square kilometers that take the player everywhere from the fjords of Norway to the narrow desert alleyways of Iraq to fight in massive team-versus-team battles with as many as 128 players.\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.realitymod.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.realitymod.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n------- ------ ----- ---- --- -- - -- --- ---- ----- ------ -------\nInstallation Instructions\n------- ------ ----- ---- --- -- - -- --- ---- ----- ------ -------\n\nInstall Battlefield 2\n\nInstall v1.41 and v1.50 patch\n\nInstall Project Reality\n\nRun Project Reality as an administrator (right click on shortcut, launcher)\n\nFinally right click on &quot;PLAY&quot; and check for updates\n\nEnjoy!\n\n------- ------ ----- ---- --- -- - -- --- ---- ----- ------ -------\nTorrent content: &quot;prbf2_1.1.0.0_full.iso&quot;\nSource: http://files.realitymod.com/bt/prbf2_1.1.0.0_full.iso.torrent\n------- ------ ----- ---- --- -- - -- --- ---- ----- ------ -------\n\n/a fellow pirate\nMAA11792","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96e1002eca4cd29ba1ec10b0af787909aaa20c63","amp;dn":"Battlefield+2%3A+Project+Reality+v1.1.0.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96e1002eca4cd29ba1ec10b0af787909aaa20c63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,225,0,46,202,76,210,155,161,236,16,176,175,120,121,9,170,162,12,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
