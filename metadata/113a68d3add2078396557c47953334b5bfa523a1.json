The portability and adaptability of digital photography has opened up the world of wedding shooting; however, on such a special occasion it's vital that the photographer is confident that he or she is up to the job. The Wedding Photography Field Guide-although compact enough to fit easily into a suit pocket-offers comprehensive and easy-to-follow advice on how to do the special day justice. Whether it's dimly lit churches or lively dance floors, wedding photography presents particular and demanding locations, and you rarely have much time to shoot. All the situations you're likely to encounter are covered here, along with advice on the best equipment, posing, people-management, and technique. The book also explores different styles of wedding photography, from the classic formal portrait to modern reportage approaches, with inspirational shots from leaders in the field.\n\nIf you download our uploads, please make sure you seed them till atleast 1:1 ratio.
