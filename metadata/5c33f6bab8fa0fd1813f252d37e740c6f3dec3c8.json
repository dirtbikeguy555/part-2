It became more popular when it was played to midnight audiences nationwide the following April. The film is referenced in the Clash songs &quot;The Guns of Brixton&quot; and &quot;Safe European Home&quot;. In 2005, it was developed into a stage musical by the Theatre Royal Stratford East and UK Arts Productions in London. Adapted by Henzell, it opened on 25 March 2006. The soundtrack to the film is considered a breakthrough for reggae in the United States.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c33f6bab8fa0fd1813f252d37e740c6f3dec3c8","amp;dn":"The+Harder+They+Come+%281972%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c33f6bab8fa0fd1813f252d37e740c6f3dec3c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,51,246,186,184,250,15,209,129,63,37,45,55,231,64,198,243,222,195,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
