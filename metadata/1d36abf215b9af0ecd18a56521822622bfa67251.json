We seek out information that supports us and downplay information that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. We get distracted by short-term emotions. When it comes to making choices, it seems, our brains are flawed instruments. Unfortunately, merely being aware of these shortcomings doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fix the problem, any more than knowing that we are nearsighted helps us to see. The real question is: How can we do better?\n\nIn Decisive, the Heaths, based on an exhaustive study of the decision-making literature, introduce a four-step process designed to counteract these biases. Written in an engaging and compulsively readable style, Decisive takes readers on an unforgettable journey, from a rock starÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ingenious decision-making trick to a CEOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disastrous acquisition, to a single question that can often resolve thorny personal decisions.\n\nAlong the way, we learn the answers to critical questions like these: How can we stop the cycle of agonizing over our decisions? How can we make group decisions without destructive politics? And how can we ensure that we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t overlook precious opportunities to change our course??\n\nDecisive is the Heath brothersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ most powerfulÃ¢â‚¬â€and importantÃ¢â‚¬â€book yet, offering fresh strategies and practical tools enabling us to make better choices. Because the right decision, at the right moment, can make all the difference.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d36abf215b9af0ecd18a56521822622bfa67251","amp;dn":"Decisive%3A+How+to+Make+Better+Choices+in+Life+and+Work","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d36abf215b9af0ecd18a56521822622bfa67251","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,54,171,242,21,185,175,14,205,24,165,101,33,130,38,34,191,166,114,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
