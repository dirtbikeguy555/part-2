The Black Book doesn't include any vocabulary lists, and doesn't advise its readers to rely on math formulas.\n\nInstead, The SAT Prep Black Book teaches readers to approach the test the same way that Barrett trains his students. Barrett sees the SAT as a standardized instrument with a specific objective, and reasons that the test must observe certain design guidelines that follow from that unique objective. So this book explains to students how different types of SAT questions are actually written, from the perspective of the College Board: for each question type, Barrett explains the &quot;big secret&quot; of that question type, the rules and patterns that all questions of that type will follow, and, most importantly for readers, exactly how to attack the question type based on the inherent weaknesses of its particular rules and patterns.\n\nThe book includes over 250 example solutions that demonstrate Barrett's approach against real SAT questions written by the College Board. In order to follow along, students will want a copy of the College Board's book &quot;The Official SAT Study Guide,&quot; the source of the questions whose solutions appear in the Black Book.\n\nThe overall lesson of the SAT Prep Black Book is that the SAT tests very basic concepts in very strange ways, so students should learn the unique habits of the test rather than cramming definitions and formulas. At 330 pages, the book is thorough and detailed in its analysis of the SAT.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79e8afb04823949f808747330fefa9e1fb7bbb10","amp;dn":"SAT+Prep+Black+Book-+The+Most+Effective+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%7B+KT+%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79e8afb04823949f808747330fefa9e1fb7bbb10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,232,175,176,72,35,148,159,128,135,71,51,15,239,169,225,251,123,187,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
