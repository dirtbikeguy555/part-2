Some friends and families are more accepting than others. Dr. Pepper Schwartz visits all three couples to see who is really making the effort to integrate their worlds versus who is still keeping their distance. Monet wants Vaughn to hang out with her girlfriends. Doug invites his parents over for dinner so his mother, who is skeptical of Jamie, can start to get to know her better. Jason goes to one of CortneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s burlesque performances, and Cortney goes to one of JasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wrestling matches. JamieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tough past comes back to haunt her as she takes husband, Doug, to visit the trailer park she grew up in.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09d43ea1a9b5783a467c9693d8305e15cae2904d","amp;dn":"Married.at.First.Sight.S01E07.Social.Life.WEB-DL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09d43ea1a9b5783a467c9693d8305e15cae2904d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,212,62,161,169,181,120,58,70,124,150,147,216,48,94,21,202,226,144,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
