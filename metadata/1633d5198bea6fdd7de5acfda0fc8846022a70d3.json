This experience has now been condensed in to Grow Your Factory, Grow your Profits: Lean for Small and Medium-Sized Manufacturing Enterprises, a start-to-finish guide on how to run a successful small and medium-sized manufacturing operation.\n\nThe book presents case studies, practical examples, illustrations, charts, and pictures from real SME manufacturers to provide straightforward solutions to the issues facing every growing manufacturing business. In the book, Tim McLean explains:\n\nHow to recruit the right people and design the right organization\nHow to empower those people to take accountability and free yourself up from day to day &quot;fire fighting&quot;\nHow to develop a Lean Plant Layout that will maximize productivity and optimize the use of space\nHow to manage materials in order to slash inventory and shortages\nHow to schedule production in order to cut lead times, cut inventory, and delight customers\nHow to get started on a Lean transformation when you lack the resources of a big company\nThe book details how SMEs differ from large organizations and why the approach to improvement must also be different. Covering the complete life cycle of small and medium-sized manufacturers, the book addresses a different SME manufacturing issue in each chapter. This enables readers to tackle issues at their own pace and in their own order of priority.\n\nGrow Your Factory, Grow Your Profits is essential reading for owners, managers, and operational leaders in the 90 percent of manufacturing enterprises that are small or medium sized","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1633d5198bea6fdd7de5acfda0fc8846022a70d3","amp;dn":"Grow+Your+Factory%2C+Grow+Your+Profits","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1633d5198bea6fdd7de5acfda0fc8846022a70d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,51,213,25,139,234,111,221,125,229,172,253,160,252,136,70,2,42,112,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
