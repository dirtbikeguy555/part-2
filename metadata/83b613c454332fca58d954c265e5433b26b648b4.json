Integrated Solutions: Because it can be boring to review math properties for days or weeks before taking practice tests, we have carefully integrated a review of all the math properties you need for the SAT into the solutions to the test problems. The SAT math section is not easy. There is no quick fix that will allow you to &quot;beat&quot; the section. But SAT math is very learnable. If you study hard and master the techniques in this book, your math score will improve--significantly! The SAT cannot be &quot;beaten.&quot; But it can be mastered--through hard work, analytical thought, and by training yourself to think like a test writer. Many of the problems in this book are designed to prompt you to think like a test writer. For example, you will find &quot;Duals.&quot; These are pairs of similar problems in which only one property is different. They illustrate the process of creating SAT questions. * If your target is a 700+ score, this is the book!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83b613c454332fca58d954c265e5433b26b648b4","amp;dn":"SAT+Math+Tests+Nova+%5BPDF%5D%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83b613c454332fca58d954c265e5433b26b648b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,182,19,196,84,51,47,202,88,217,84,194,101,229,67,59,38,182,72,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
