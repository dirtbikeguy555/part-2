Want to be able to eat the foods you love? Reaching your goals can only happen when you don't feel deprived and you continue to stay motivated. Now, celebrity trainer and star of the hit reality series The Biggest Loser, Dolvett Quince, tells you how to do all of that and more in his revolutionary program, THE 3-1-2-1 DIET.\n\n This 21-day program works by manipulating your body's natural tendency to slow its metabolic rate in response to calorie restriction. It takes a new approach to getting lean-one scientifically based on changing up food and calories to tap into your body's potential to burn fat. This unconventional plan results in greater muscle and less fat than any other diet you've ever tried.\n\n Dolvett's effective eating plan is as easy as 3-1-2-1: three days of clean eating, one day of cheating, two more days of clean eating, and one final reward meal at the end of the week. No foods are off limits and you will never feel deprived because the plan is flexible enough to fit into any lifestyle. You'll lose weight fast-10 pounds or more in just 21 days-and you won't plateau.\n Dolvett's simple meal plans and delicious, easy-to-prepare recipes, together with his fast and effective workouts that combine cardio and body-shaping moves, will have you back in your skinny jeans in less than three weeks !!\n\n======================================\n\n28 Day Diet Plan: Loose Up To 37 Pounds In 28 Days\n\nGetAdvice\n2013 \nEnglish\nISBN   N/A\npages: 33\nPDF \n3.06 MB\n\nDirections For The 28-Day Diet:\n- Weigh yourself at the beginning of this diet and also when you finish it (4 weeks); and you will be thrilled to find how much weight you have lost.\n\n- This diet does not depend on calories, but upon the vital chemical interactions in your body.
