Following a prestigious classical career sanctioned by several international awards (France, Hungary, Finland, USA), and the diploma of the Conservatoire National SupÃƒÂ©rieur de Musique de Paris, Ibrahim became a well-known figure on the music scene thanks to his collaboration with singers such as Sting, Amadou et Mariam, Lhasa de Sela, Matthieu ChÃƒÂ©did and many others who wanted to use his sound and his unique playing style to colour their music. Ibrahim was rapidly recognized by the jazz world and his three first albums Ã¢â‚¬Å“DiasporasÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (2007), Ã¢â‚¬Å“DiachronismÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (2009) and Ã¢â‚¬Å“DiagnosticÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (2011) were unanimously acclaimed by the national and international press. His music and his trumpet playing are strongly inspired by his Arabic culture, but the instruments around him (bass, electric guitar, drums, Arabic percussion and vibraphones) and the musicians with whom he performs give a more contemporary rock, electro and jazz-funk flavor to his music. His concerts are generally built around stimulating music that makes people want to get up and dance. But there is always a short, more contemplative, mystical interlude during his concerts, which he calls &quot;a collective universal prayer&quot;. Maalouf gets a lot of his inspiration from his culture of origin. His latest album Ã¢â‚¬Å“WindÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (2012) featuring his New York Quintet: star sidemen Mark Turner (sax) and Clarence Penn (drums), seems certain to broaden his audience. After Ã¢â‚¬Å“WindÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a purely acoustic jazz album, Ibrahim Maalouf comes back with a more electric album, called Ã¢â‚¬Å“IllusionsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, to be released in November.\n\nMusicians:\n\nIbrahim Maalouf: Trumpet, composition &amp; arrangements \nFranÃƒÂ§ois Delporte: Guitars \nFrank Woeste: Keyboards \nLaurent David: Bass \nXaxier RogÃƒÂ©: Drums \nYouenn Le Cam, Martin Saccardy: Trumpets \nYann Martin: Lead Trumpet \n\n\nTrackList:\n\nIllusions (03:38) \nConspiracy Generation (08:57) \nInPressi (04:08) \nNomade Slang (06:05) \nBusy (10:24) \nIf You Wanna Be a Woman (06:42) \nUnfaithful (04:26) \nTrue Sorry (04:52) \nIllusion (03:20) \n\n\nDuration : 52:29 | Bitrate : 320 Kbit/s | Year : 2013 | Size : 128 mb\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45d6b5d36343f08e97b492afdbf0811cb14f5764","amp;dn":"Ibrahim+Maalouf+-+2013+-+Illusions","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45d6b5d36343f08e97b492afdbf0811cb14f5764","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,214,181,211,99,67,240,142,151,180,146,175,219,240,129,28,177,79,87,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
