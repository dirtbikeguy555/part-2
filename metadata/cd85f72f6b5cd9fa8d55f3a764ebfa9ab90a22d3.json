Indeed, most default effects in FSX and P3D are drab and doesnâ€™t look like anything realistic. PrecipitFX will bring your simming experience to new heights with completely revamped contrails, rain and snow textures as well as overhauled effects wheels spray and engine wash effects. \r\n\r\nNot my work.
