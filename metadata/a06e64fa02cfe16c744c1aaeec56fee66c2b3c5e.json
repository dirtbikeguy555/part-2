Ricardo Darin stars as Benjamin, a former criminal court employee who wants to write a novel about an Argentine case from the 1970s where a woman was raped and murdered. He confides his intentions in a judge with whom he's been secretly smitten for years, Irene (Soledad Villamil) but she expresses reservations about the idea, for reasons that soon become apparent. Meanwhile, flashbacks set up a parallel story, unfolding in 1970s Argentina. In that narrative, Argentina has fallen under the control of a military junta and a fair trial has become an increasingly uncommon event in that nation's courts. A woman is found raped and murdered while her husband was at work, and two immigrant workers are essentially forced into confessing to the crime. Back in the present day, Benjamin teams up with his colleague and friend, the lush Sandoval (Guillermo Francella) and the two go about identifying and tagging the perpetrator of the original crime. Subtle detail in a photograph alerts Benjamin to the possibility that a man named Gomez (Javier Godino) may have been the real culprit, but finding Gomez and obtaining conclusive evidence against him is no simple task. Moreover, as Benjamin and Gomez struggle to have the case reopened, they also find that bureaucracy and power in Argentine government have made this close to impossible. El Secreto De Sus Ojos (aka The Secret In Their Eyes) received its North American premiere at the 2009 Toronto International Film Festival. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : El secreto de sus ojos.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      Duration : 2h 4mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 576 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : No\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 2h 4mn\n      Bit rate : 1 374 Kbps\n      Width : 720 pixels\n      Height : 360 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 2.000\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.212\n      Stream size : 1.19 GiB (87%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 2h 4mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 171 MiB (12%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n\nIMDB: tt1305806\n\nSpanish audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted at KG by Vertigen\n\nJ.J.Campanella - El secreto de sus ojos (2009) ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a06e64fa02cfe16c744c1aaeec56fee66c2b3c5e","amp;dn":"J.J.Campanella+-+El+secreto+de+sus+ojos+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a06e64fa02cfe16c744c1aaeec56fee66c2b3c5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,110,100,250,2,207,225,108,116,76,26,174,236,86,254,230,108,43,60,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
