Recorded at Sound City Studios in Los Angeles with long-time producer and collaborator James Ford, it has a summery pop feel--the sound of some out of season sun for the boys, with most of the work done on the West Coast in January.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85b01a4d17efb85e586ecf3e2180cc4ade291b60","amp;dn":"Arctic+Monkeys+-+Suck+It+And+See+%282011%29.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85b01a4d17efb85e586ecf3e2180cc4ade291b60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,176,26,77,23,239,184,94,88,110,207,62,33,128,204,74,222,41,27,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
