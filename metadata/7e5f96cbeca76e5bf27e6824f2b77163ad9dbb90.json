The album's minimalist packaging does not specifically date the latter, however, the live versions of &quot;For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her&quot; and &quot;Kathy's Song&quot; included on Greatest Hits were also included on the 2008 album Live 1969.\n\nThe liner notes to Live 1969 state that these two songs were both recorded at a November 1969 concert in St. Louis, Missouri. In a 1975 BBC Radio 1 interview, Roy Halee identified this version of &quot;The 59th Street Bridge Song&quot; as being from Simon &amp; Garfunkel's 1970 performance at Carnegie Hall, &quot;the last concert they did together.&quot; The version of &quot;Kathy's Song&quot; was taken from a 1968 concert in Vermont, according to the liner notes from Collected Works.\n\nThe remaining ten studio songs comprise nine singles released between 1965 and 1972, &quot;America&quot; being issued as a single several years after its appearance as a track on the Bookends album, and one album track, &quot;Bookends&quot; (without its parent song &quot;Old Friends&quot;).\n\nAll but &quot;America&quot; and &quot;Scarborough Fair/Canticle&quot; made the Top Ten, with the latter peaking at #11, and &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; topped the chart aided by its appearance in Mike Nichols' hit movie The Graduate. &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot; and &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; both peaked at #1 as singles in their studio versions, and &quot;The Boxer&quot; peaked as a single at #7.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img216.imageshack.us/img216/3272/simonandgarfunkelgreatesthitsfuv7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img216.imageshack.us/img216/3272/simonandgarfunkelgreatesthitsfuv7.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n1. \tMrs. Robinson \n2. \tFor Emily, Whenever I May Find Her [Live]\n3. \tThe Boxer\n4. \tThe 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy) [Live] \n5. \tThe Sound of Silence [Live]\n6. \tI Am A Rock \n7. \tScarborough Fair/Canticle \n8. \tHomeward Bound [Live] \n9. \tBridge Over Troubled Water [Live] \n10. \tAmerica \n11. \tKathy's Song [Live] \n12. \tEl Condor Pasa (If I Could) \n13. \tBookends\n14. \tCecilia ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e5f96cbeca76e5bf27e6824f2b77163ad9dbb90","amp;dn":"Simon+and+Garfunkel+-+Greatest+Hits+%5BMp3+320+kbps%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e5f96cbeca76e5bf27e6824f2b77163ad9dbb90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,95,150,203,236,167,110,91,242,126,104,36,242,183,113,99,173,157,187,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
