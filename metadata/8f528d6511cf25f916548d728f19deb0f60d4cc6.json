At once witty, sardonic, and sexy, Schama's approach to art couples socio-historical scholarship with the pure joy in viewing something that invigorates the eye, the brain and the heart.\n\nThe Power of Art utilizes Schama's wonderfully written narration he brings to so many of his BBC documentaries, as well as beautifully staged and acted mini-dramas to capture the artist's historical context.\n\nBy appealing to the everyman's enjoyment of beautiful art, the scholar's love of history, and the artist's appreciation for the myriad influences and subtleties of the craft, Schama's Power of Art is simply lovely. &quot;\n\n\n\nThe Power Of Art at BBC: http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/powerofart\n\nThe Power Of Art at PBS: http://www.pbs.org/wnet/powerofart\n\n\n\n\nEpisodes:\n\n1: Caravaggio\n2: Bernini\n3: Rembrandt\n4: David\n5: Turner\n6: Van Gogh (portrayed by Andy Serkis)\n7: Picasso\n8: Rothko.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f528d6511cf25f916548d728f19deb0f60d4cc6","amp;dn":"The+Power+of+Art++%28BBC+-+Simon+Schama+-+Complete+Series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f528d6511cf25f916548d728f19deb0f60d4cc6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,82,141,101,17,207,37,249,22,84,141,114,143,25,222,176,246,13,76,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
