The name Borland Pascal was generally reserved for the high end packages (with more libraries and standard library source code) while the original cheap and widely known version was sold as Turbo Pascal. The name Borland Pascal is also used more generically for Borland\\&amp;#039;s dialect of Pascal.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d95644175c88092826d0af75335741dd676e048","amp;dn":"Turbo+Pascal+7.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d95644175c88092826d0af75335741dd676e048","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,149,100,65,117,200,128,146,130,109,10,247,83,53,116,29,214,118,224,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
