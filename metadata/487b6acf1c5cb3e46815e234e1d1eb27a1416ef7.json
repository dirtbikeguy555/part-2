Their sound has hardened into a \n blunt, aggressive slab of metallic guitars and hammering drums, giving the album a  visceral force. The Deftones tap into the same alternative-metal vibe as Korn and L7, and while they don't have catchy riffs or a fully developed sound, Around the Fur suggests they're about to come into their own. \n    \n  Track Listing....: \n  01.My own summer (shove it) [03:35] \n  02.Lhabia [04:11] \n  03.Mascara [03:45] \n  04.Around the fur [03:32] \n  05.Rickets [02:43] \n  06.Be quiet and drive [05:08] \n  (far away) \n  07.Lotion [03:58] \n  08.Dai the flu [04:37] \n  09.Headup [05:13] \n  10.Mx,damone [37:19] \n  ____ \n  \n  74:01 min \n  103,9 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:487b6acf1c5cb3e46815e234e1d1eb27a1416ef7","amp;dn":"Deftones-Around_The_Fur-%28Retail%29-1997-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"487b6acf1c5cb3e46815e234e1d1eb27a1416ef7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,123,106,207,28,92,179,228,104,21,226,52,225,209,235,39,161,65,110,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
