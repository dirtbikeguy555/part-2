Some analogies have been found between gas and liquid phases, but the big challenge to operate in a condensed phase lies in the role of the solvent in tuning the reactantâ€“catalyst contact. Liquid-phase oxidation has numerous applications. However, many studies on gold catalysts have been devoted to gas-phase reactions. Only recently has the scientific community approached gold-catalyzed liquid-phase oxidation. This complete, exhaustive book covers the topic of gold-based catalyst applications in selective oxidation in the liquid phase. It presents a rational state of the art and will be useful for researchers, even those not yet involved in the field","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00933a383bc0e6b049e33fa4ac92744eb2023496","amp;dn":"Gold+Catalysis+-+Preparation%2C+Characterization%2C+and+Applications","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00933a383bc0e6b049e33fa4ac92744eb2023496","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,147,58,56,59,192,230,176,73,227,63,164,172,146,116,78,178,2,52,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
