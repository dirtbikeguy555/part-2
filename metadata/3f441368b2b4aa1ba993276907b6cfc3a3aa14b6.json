Pulitzer Prize-winning author and distinguished astronomer Carl Sagan argues that scientific thinking is critical not only to the pursuit of truth but to the very well-being of our democratic institutions.\nCasting a wide net through history and culture, Sagan examines and authoritatively debunks such celebrated fallacies of the past as witchcraft, faith healing, demons, and UFOs. And yet, disturbingly, in today's so-called information age, pseudoscience is burgeoning with stories of alien abduction, channeling past lives, and communal hallucinations commanding growing attention and respect. As Sagan demonstrates with lucid eloquence, the siren song of unreason is not just a cultural wrong turn but a dangerous plunge into darkness that threatens our most basic freedoms.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f441368b2b4aa1ba993276907b6cfc3a3aa14b6","amp;dn":"The+Demon+Haunted+World+-+Science+has+a+Candle+in+the+Dark+-+Car","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f441368b2b4aa1ba993276907b6cfc3a3aa14b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,68,19,104,178,180,170,27,169,147,39,105,7,182,207,195,163,170,20,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
