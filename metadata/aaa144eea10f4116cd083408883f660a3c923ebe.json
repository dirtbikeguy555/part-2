The seeds for the band were planted in another Chicago band during the late '60s, the Tradewinds, which featured brothers Chuck and John Panozzo (who played bass and drums,respectively), as well as acquaintance Dennis DeYoung (vocals, keyboards). By the dawn of the '70s, the group had changed its name to TW4, and welcomed aboard a pair of guitarists/vocalists, James &quot;JY&quot; Young and John Curulewski -- securing a recording contract in 1972 with Wooden Nickel Records (a subsidiary of RCA). Soon after, the group opted to change its name once more, this time to Styx, named after a river from Greek mythology that ran through &quot;the land of the dead&quot; in the underworld.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Too Much Time On My Hands\n02.Come Sail Away\n03.Blue Collar Man (Long Nights)\n04.Lorelei\n05.Fooling Yourself (The Angry Young Man)\n06.Mr. Roboto\n07.Boat On The River\n08.The Best Of Times\n09.Mademoiselle\n10.Babe\n11.Show Me The Way\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaa144eea10f4116cd083408883f660a3c923ebe","amp;dn":"Styx+-+20th+Century+Masters+Best+Of+%282002%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaa144eea10f4116cd083408883f660a3c923ebe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,161,68,238,161,15,65,22,205,8,52,8,136,63,102,10,60,146,62,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
