The discography I show here is not really complete. His whole opera is vaste and there are works which are scarcely mentioned even on his site: This is simply what was available searching online, but I deem you will like anyway the insight it offers.\n\nYou will find here 78 albums, solo and collaborations.\nAll the album are zipped (since the number of files was too high for TPB).\nThe sampling rate is 320kbps when possible.\nDifferent rates are signed in the name of the albums zips. Soundtracks are signed as &quot;ost&quot;...\n\nEnjoy :)\n\n1 - Solo\n\n\t1976 - A Walk Through H\n\t1976 - Decay Music - 256\n\t1979 - Masterwork Samples - 128\n\t1982 - The Draughtman's Contract - ost\n\t1984 - The Cold Room - ost - 192\n\t1985 - A Zed and Two Noughts - ost\n\t1985 - The Kiss and Other Movements\n\t1986 - And Do They Do, Zoo Caprices\n\t1988 - Drowning by Numbers - ost\n\t1988 - The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat - VBR\n\t1989 - La Sept, Suite\n\t1989 - La TraversÃƒÂ©e de Paris - 192\n\t1989 - Out of The Ruins\n\t1989 - The Cook The Thief His Wife Her Lover - ost\n\t1991 - Prospero`s Books - ost\n\t1992 - Le Mari De La Coiffeuse - ost\n\t1992 - The Essential\n\t1993 - The Piano - ost\n\t1993 - Time Will Pronounce\n\t1994 - Michael Nyman Live\n\t1994 - Six Days, Six Nights - ost\n\t1995  - Noises, Sounds and Sweet Airs - VBR\n\t1995 - Carrington - ost\n\t1995 - The Diary of Anne Frank - ost\n\t1995 - The Piano Concerto _ On The Fiddle _ Prospero's Books - 256\n\t1996 - After Extra Time\n\t1996 - Ogre - ost\n\t1997 - Concertos\n\t1997 - Enemy Zero - ost\n\t1997 - Gattaca - ost\n\t1998 - The Piano Concerto - Where The Bee Dances\n\t1998 - The Suit and The Photograph\n\t1999 - The Commissar Vanishes _ The Fall of Icarus\n\t1999 - The End of The Affair - ost\n\t1999 - Wonderland - ost\n\t2001 - The Claim - ost\n\t2001 - The Very Best of Michael Nyman - Film Music 1980 - 2001\n\t2002 - Facing Goya\n\t2002 - Man With A Movie Camera - ost\n\t2002 - Sangam _ Michael Nyman Meets Indian Masters\n\t2002 - String Quartets 2 3 and 4 If and Why\n\t2003 - 24 Heures de La Vie d'Une Femme - ost\n\t2003 - The Actors\n\t2003 - The Very Best\n\t2004 - Music for Two Pianos\n\t2005 - Man and Boy _ Dada\n\t2005 - Six Celan Songs - The Ballad of Kastriot Rexhepi\n\t2005 - The Libertine - ost\n\t2005 - The Piano Sings\n\t2006 - Act of Beauty - Exit No Exit\n\t2006 - Nyman Brass\n\t2006 - The Composer's Cut Series Vol I _ The Draughtsman's Contract\n\t2006 - The Composer's Cut Series Vol II _ Greenaway Revisited\n\t2006 - The Composer's Cut Series Vol III _ The Piano\n\t2007 - Love Counts\n\t2008 - 8 Lust Songs - I Sonetti Lussuriosi\n\t2008 - Man on Wire - ost\n\t2008 - MGV _ The Piano Concerto\n\t2008 - Mozart 252\n\t2010 - Collections _ Portrait of a Label\n\t2010 - Vertov Sounds\n\t2011 - Michael Nyman [30th anniversary Edition]\n        \n\nwith Alan Silvestri\n\n\t1998 - Practical Magic - ost\n        \n\nwith Alexander Balanescu\n\n\t1991 - Balanescu Quartet - String Quartets 1 - 3\n\t1993 - Michael Nyman for Yohji Yamamoto\n        \n\nMichael Nymanwith Damon Albarn\n\n\t1999 - Ravenous - ost\n        \n\nwith David McAlmont\n\n\t2009 - The Coldest Place on Earth - single\n\t2009 - The Glare\n        \n\nwith Delta Saxophone Quartet\n\n\t1998 - Minimal Tendencies\n        \n\nwith London Saxophonic\n\n\t1998 - An Eye for A Difference - VBR\n        \n\nwith Motion Trio\n\n\t2009 - Acoustic Accordions\n        \n\nwith Philip Glass\n\n\t2011 - Works for Saxophone Quartet\n        \n\nwith Piano Circus\n\n\t1992 - Piano Circus - VBR\n        \n\nwith The Flying Lizards\n\n\t1981 - Fourth Wall\n        \n\nWith Ute Lemper\n\n\t1992 - Songbook\n        \n\nwith various authors\n\n\t1976 - Recent English Experimental Music - VBR\n\t1980 - From Brussels With Love - VBR\n\t1980 - Miniatures _ edited by Morgan Fisher - 192\n\n\n\n\n\n(browse all my torrents:\n         &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tpb.pirateparty.org.uk/user/n0b0dyh0me&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tpb.pirateparty.org.uk/user/n0b0dyh0me&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nfor private posts:\n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=113028&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=113028&lt;/a&gt;\n\n)\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:580247256495139b7e9494bd1e288de1333575e3","amp;dn":"Michael+Nyman+discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"580247256495139b7e9494bd1e288de1333575e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,2,71,37,100,149,19,155,126,148,148,189,30,40,141,225,51,53,117,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
