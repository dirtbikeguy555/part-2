Recruit a crew, outfit and customize your ship and set sail on the open seas. There youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll use any combination of aggression, diversion and trade to become the most infamous pirate crew of the seven seas! You can raid, pillage and plunder everything in your path, divert and lie to get what you want or trade for a quick buck. Remember to be careful though, death is everywhere and quite permanent! Adventure awaitsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \n\n\nCurrent features: \n\nSandbox open world Pirate simulator. \nProcedurally generated world that changes each new game you play. While not a Roguelike in the strictest of sense, it does strike of one. \nVast over-world map full of danger, loot, and people to prey on. \nComprehensive loot system, upgrade-able weapons and armor, special and secret loot to deck out your sailors. \nParrots, Pets and Plunder!! \nDeath around every corner, our permadeath system will have you tearing your hair out at each loss and shrieking in delight at each victory. \nEach playthrough will require around 20 hours to get through (with at least 4 playthroughs needed to see all the game has to offer) \nCONSTANT updates and content patches. We update on a weekly basis (Friday), and will continue to do so for at least a year after launch in order to provide many new systems, fixes, and bits of content. \n\nPATCH 1.0.8\n\nBug Fixes \nFixed bug where difficulty settings were not being saved properly \nHealing item tooltips did not display correct info about how the items work \nPlayer was able to grapple onto sinking boats and boat pieces after plundering \nPirates can now walk on destroyed ship blocks\nImprovements \nAdded a window displaying latest changes, fixes and improvements when starting up the game \nAdded a confirmation message when trying to sail away from an enemy ship without plundering it\n\nMikko is hard worker! I think next week there won't be any patch but day after that week we will have a bigger one! \n\nStay tuned Sailors! \n\n- Vitali out!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30264e8f8da4829a7f8127f8af52cca6991b98ea","amp;dn":"Pixel+Piracy+v1.0.8+3DM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30264e8f8da4829a7f8127f8af52cca6991b98ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,38,78,143,141,164,130,154,127,129,39,248,175,82,204,166,153,27,152,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
