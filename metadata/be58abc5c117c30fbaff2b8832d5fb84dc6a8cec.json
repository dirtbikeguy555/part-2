Their style is referred to by themselves and some online album review sites as &quot;humorcore&quot; or &quot;comedy metal&quot;. To date they have released three albums nationally. Their debut album, We Couldn't Think of a Title, was released on September 12, 2006. Their second album, Sandwich, was released on May 5, 2009, and their most recent, titled Space Vampires VS Zombie Dinosaurs in 3D, was released August 16, 2011. They began touring nationally in July 2006, and have toured with Mushroomhead, Look What I Did, Powerglove, Bobaflex, and have played with many national bands, including Three Days Grace, Army of Anyone, Sick Puppies, Anew Revolution, The Exies, Smile Empty Soul, as well as many others.\n\nRyan Cooper at punkmusic.about.com wrote:\n\n\nQuote:\nMuch of my early musical tastes have leaned toward the farcical and humorous. Bands like the Dead Milkmen grabbed my attention for their wittiness, sense of humor and the way they used humor as a vehicle for political thought or just for humorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sake, while SOD made thrash something that didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need to be taken seriously. Other single tracks, like Mucky PupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classic Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Skinheads Stole My WalkmanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, with its heavy riffs and silly lyrics, was a track that I played over and over in my car, despite the fact that doing so meant rewinding it each it time. And if anything, my love of the style has increased, with bands like Iwrestledabearonce mashing grindcore sounds with simple high weirdness, Tenacious D doing that thing they do and Dethklok creating a metallic soundtrack to one of the best animated series ever created.\n\nPsychostick is a band cut from the same cloth, a band that merges a tight instrumental foundation with a refusal to take anything seriously. Formed by four guys who love comedy as much as they love thrash-heavy riffs, their fourth album, the crowd-funded Revenge of the Vengeance takes a title that sounds lifted from a badly translated Kung Fu movie and uses it as a platform for a pile of tracks with downright silly lyrics atop of seriously crushing thrash music.\n\nFollowing a cinematic-style intro, the record rolls right into the beard anthem Ã¢â‚¬Å“Obey the BeardÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ a chant-heavy thrashfest that sets a silly tone for the entire album, and secures the band a place as the Ã¢â‚¬Ëœcore version of The Bloodhound Gang and makes my beard grow thicker just by listening - something chin-challenged thrash heads should take note of. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s followed by Ã¢â‚¬Å“President RhinoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a tribute to a US president whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also, well, a rhino. Pure silliness.\n\nAnd while the record already has displayed elements its comedic genius, it truly comes forward in Ã¢â‚¬Å“So HeavyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ a song that trudges its way through metallic sludge while simultaneously making fun itself. It could easily be a jab at every band that takes itself too seriously by playing as heavily as they possibly can if it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t also an incredibly heavy itself - as its name implies. Now this record has peaked early, but its not ready for any descent. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dogs Like SocksÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a track presented from the canine perspective, as he extols the virtues of hosiery.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Quack KillsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ explains the fear of a duck in a style reminiscent of System of a Down, while Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blue ScreenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is the sort of emo-core sad boy anthem that I detest, but presented this way - from someone mourning the loss of the contents of a hard drive, it becomes tolerable. Ã¢â‚¬Å“NSFWÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ appeals to the thirteen-year-old boy in me consisting primarily of a single word repeated over and over again - one that begins with an F - in a nigh-operatic majesty that includes guest vocals from another humor core master, Green JellyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bill Manspeaker (who also will appear elsewhere on the record).\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to really define a track that on the record that truly depicts a peak when itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all peaks. Ã¢â‚¬Å“AWESOMEÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a anthem to things that are (as well as sort of) awesome, and should include this record, which includes a metallic-infused take on Kenny Loggins' Ã¢â‚¬Å“Danger ZoneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as well as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Choking HazardÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, an instructional manual on dealing with a choking victim that could have easily been a Dethklok PSA.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Fight to the DeathÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is another pit anthem that details the violence inherent in the struggle for the last slice of pizza, while perhaps the greatest moment for me is the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s majestic tribute to local boy Bruce Campbell. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s given the respect he deserves as a master of cinema with all the admiration of an obsessed fan whose deviation borders on stalkerly. And cinematic segues abound, heavily populated by the voice of Bill Manspeaker, but the funniest is Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dimensional Time PortalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a PG13-rated radio play that hypes the power of metal to save the world as we know it, and leads into to albumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s closer (if you discount the outtake track) Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Power of Metal Compels YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, one last track that could have easily been lifted from a Metalocalypse episode.\n\nFans of old-school thrash bands that were inclined toward silliness - bands like SOD, Anthrax or Suicidal Tendencies, will find the sound readily accessible, and those alienated by the heavier side of things may find Psychostick to be a Ã¢â‚¬Å“gateway bandÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, as the lyrics are accessible by virtue of their humor. I love when a band refuses to take its subject seriously, but also realizes that its no excuse for being instrumental slobs. Psychostick doles out the humor and the thrash in equal doses. They are the reigning kings of humorcore, and prove that the pit is a place for having a good time, that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s OK to be smiling the whole time youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re there.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. &quot;Revenge of the Vengeance&quot;\n2. &quot;Obey the Beard&quot;\n3. &quot;President Rhino&quot;\n4. &quot;H-Flat&quot; (skit)\n5. &quot;So.
