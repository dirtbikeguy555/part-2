The presentation format is plain, with no graphical representation or time line. Readers will find a succession of chronological entries, including a date, a geographical label (e.g., China, England, Italy), a religious label (e.g., Christianity, Islam, Judaism), and a paragraphÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth of highly readable information on the corresponding event. The unique size of this chronology (four volumes) allows for the inclusion of many lesser-known events that would ordinarily be left out of a general-purpose reference work. this work offers so much more than just mindless dates that it can be read in a leisurely manner. And for the sake of those wanting pinpoint access to a particular event, the sets extensive index is included in every volume.
