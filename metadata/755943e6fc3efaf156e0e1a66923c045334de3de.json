This should fix the problem whereas some X-mics didn't bounce (earlier bounce files would be overwritten).\n-Changing volume of both the Crash Articulation and the Mute Tails articulations should no longer affect the quality of the mutes.\n-using the envelope to fade the 'tails' of muted cymbals now works more reliably.\nresetting the pitch section should now redraw the pitch value correctly.\n-authorization should now be more resilient to hardware changes, particularly when removable LAN cards are used.\n\n\nSystem requirements\n\nWindows XP SP3 or newer, 2 GHz Pentium 4 or Athlon processor with 1 GB RAM (multi-core CPU with 2 GB RAM or more recommended)\n\n\n\nINSTALLATION:\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Uninstall previous versions.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ You need WinRAR to extract the rar's files.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Burn or mount the image.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Run the *.msi official installer.\n\nQuote:\nUNLOCKED NOTE :\n\nNo activations are needed for the expansions.\n\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ That's it!
