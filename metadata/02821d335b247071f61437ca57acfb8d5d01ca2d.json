His answer to this desire is to create International Rescue, a unique private emergency response service equipped with customed designed vehicles and equipment that enable the organization to react to any crisis whether it be in sea, air, land, or space. \n\nJeff's five sons volunteer to operate as the pilots and field agents, as well &quot;Brains&quot; (alias Hiram B. Hackenbaker) as the team engineer. In addition, Jeff's friend, Kyrano and his daughter Tin Tin agree to be the support staff. In addition to the field team, IR also maintains an intelligence network with Lady Penelope and her ex-con chauffer, Parker as the chief agents in this arm. The series depicts this team as they answer various calls for help around and beyond the world while they prevent enemies like the Hood from learning and exploiting their secrets.\n\n\nThe complete original Thunderbirds series.\n\n\n\n\nFiles:\nThunderbirds - 01x01 - Trapped In The Sky.avi 350.4 MB \nThunderbirds - 01x02 - Pit Of Peril.avi 350.4 MB \nThunderbirds - 01x03 - City Of Fire.avi 350.4 MB \nThunderbirds - 01x04 - Sun Probe.avi 350.4 MB \nThunderbirds - 01x05 - The Uninvited.avi 350.2 MB \nThunderbirds - 01X06 The Mighty Atom.mp4 265.2 MB \nThunderbirds - 01x07 - Vault Of Death.avi 350.6 MB \nThunderbirds - 01X08 Operation Crash Dive.mp4 270.9 MB \nThunderbirds - 01x09 - Move And You're Dead.avi 350.4 MB \nThunderbirds - 01x10 - Martian Invasion.avi 350.5 MB \nThunderbirds - 01x11 - Brink Of Disaster - nt.avi 350.3 MB \nThunderbirds - 01x12 - The Perils Of Penelope.avi 350.4 MB \nThunderbirds - 01x13 - Terror in New York City.avi 350 MB \nThunderbirds - 01x14 - End Of The Road.avi 350.3 MB \nThunderbirds - 01x15 - Day Of Disaster.avi 350.6 MB \nThunderbirds - 01x16 - Edge Of Impact.avi 350.9 MB \nThunderbirds - 01x17 - Desperate Intruder.avi 350.1 MB \nThunderbirds - 01x18 - 30 Minutes After Noon.avi 350.5 MB \nThunderbirds - 01x19 - The Impostors.avi 350.9 MB \nThunderbirds - 01x20 - The Man From M.I.5.avi 350.8 MB \nThunderbirds - 01x21 - Cry Wolf.avi 350.3 MB \nThunderbirds - 01x22 - Danger At Ocean Deep.avi 350.7 MB \nThunderbirds - 01x23 - The Duchess Assignment.avi 350.8 MB \nThunderbirds - 01x24 - Attack Of The Alligators.avi 350 MB \nThunderbirds - 01x25 - The Cham-Cham.avi 350.7 MB \nThunderbirds - 01x26 - Security Hazard.avi 350.3 MB \nThunderbirds - 02x01 - Atlantic Inferno.avi 350 MB \nThunderbirds - 02x02 - Path of Destruction.avi 350 MB \nThunderbirds - 02x03 - Alias Mr. Hackenbacker.avi 350.3 MB \nThunderbirds - 02x04 - Lord Parker's 'Oliday.avi 350.6 MB \nThunderbirds - 02x05 The Cham Cham.mp4 262.8 MB \nThunderbirds - 02X06 The Imposters.mp4 269.1 MB \n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02821d335b247071f61437ca57acfb8d5d01ca2d","amp;dn":"Thunderbirds+-+The+Complete+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02821d335b247071f61437ca57acfb8d5d01ca2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,130,29,51,91,36,112,113,246,20,55,202,87,172,251,141,93,1,202,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
