And like most of :\n : humanity, Wade is obsessed by the ultimate lottery ticket that lies        :\n : concealed within this alternate reality: OASIS founder James Halliday, who :\n : dies with no heir, has promised that control of the OASIS - and his massive:\n : fortune - will go to the person who can solve the riddles he has left      :\n : scattered throughout his creation. For years, millions have struggled      :\n : fruitlessly to attain this prize, knowing only that the riddles are based  :\n : in the culture of the late twentieth century. And then Wade stumbles onto  :\n : the key to the first puzzle.Suddenly, he finds himself pitted against      :\n : thousands of competitors in a desperate race to claim the ultimate prize, a:\n : chase that soon takes on terrifying real-world dimensions - and that will  :\n : leave both Wade and his world profoundly changed.                          :","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8cf366af8a794a46935617a3fe7719a5e5d70b7","amp;dn":"Ernest+Cline+Ready+Player+One+2011+Retail+EPUB+eBook-BitBook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8cf366af8a794a46935617a3fe7719a5e5d70b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,207,54,106,248,167,148,164,105,53,97,122,63,231,113,154,94,93,112,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
