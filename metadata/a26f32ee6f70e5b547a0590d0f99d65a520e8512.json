From every track on this compilation CD comes the gentleness, warmth and musicianship of a human who considered himself the world's slowest sax player.  None of the raucous intensity of screaming horns here - instead savour the purity of sax, guitar and rhythm section and marvel at the depths of feeling that Paul Desmond expressed with such seeming ease.  His untimely death in 1977 left an enormous hole in jazz music.  Listening to this album makes us realise why it is that the hole has been impossible to fill. - Amazon reviewer\n\nCuts # 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12 are from Paul Desmond's Easy Living - 6/63, 7/64, 9/64, 6/65: \nPersonnel: \nPaul Desmond/Alto Sax \nJim Hall/Guitar \nEugene Wright/Bass (1, 8, 12) \nEugene Cherico/Bass (6) \nPercy Heath/Bass (3, 7, 10) \nConnie Kay/Drums \n\nCuts # 2, 5, 11, 13 are from Paul Desmond's Take Ten - 6/63 \nPersonnel: \nPaul Desmond/Alto Sax \nJim Hall/Guitar \nGene Cherico/Bass (2, 5, 11) \nGene Wright/Bass (13) \nConnie Kay/Drums \n\nCuts # 4 &amp; 9 are from Paul Desmond's Desmond Blue - 10/61 \nPersonnel: \nPaul Desmond/Alto Sax \nMilt Hinton/Bass \nRobert Thomas/Drums/Percussion/Strings \nAlbert Richman/French Horn \nRomeo Penque/Woodwinds \nStan Webb/Woodwinds \nGloria Agostini/Harp \n\nCut # 14 is from Desmond/Mulligan's Two of a Mind - 9/62 \nPersonnel: \nPaul Desmond/alto sax \nGerry Mulligan/baritone Sax \nWendell Marshall/bass \nConnie Kay/drums \n\nPaul Desmond - Feeling Blue Tracks: \n01 When Joanna Loved Me (Wells-Segal) 5:40 \n02 Alone Together (Schwartz-Dietz) 6:50 \n03 HereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s That Rainy Day (Van Heusen-Burke) 5:41 \n04 Body and Soul (Green-Heyman-Eyton) 4:50 \n05 Samba dÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Orpheu (Bonfa) 4:19 \n06 Polka Dots and Moonbeams (Van Heusen-Burke) 5:47 \n07 Bewitched (Rodgers-Hart) 6:23 \n08 That Old Feeling (Brown-Fain) 5:44 \n09 I've Got You Under My Skin 4:48 \n10 I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face (Loewe-Lerner) 4:15 \n11 The One I Love (Belongs to Somebody Else) (Jones-Kahn) 5:35 \n12 Easy Living (Robin-Ranger) 7:04 \n13 Embarcadero (Desmond) 3:57 \n14 All the Things You Are (Kern-Hammerstein) 5:49","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a26f32ee6f70e5b547a0590d0f99d65a520e8512","amp;dn":"Paul+Desmond+-+Feeling+Blue+%281996%29++%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bschon5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a26f32ee6f70e5b547a0590d0f99d65a520e8512","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,111,50,238,111,112,229,181,71,160,89,13,15,153,214,90,82,14,133,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
