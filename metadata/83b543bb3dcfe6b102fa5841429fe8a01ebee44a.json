I&amp;#039;m not a big fan of Steve Martin but this work or his just has me rolling. An update of Cyrano. Count it when he has to do 20 comebacks. All-in-all, just a really fun movie for guys and dolls.\n\nLove can come to a guy with an enormous nose. (Well, you know how the size of a man&amp;#039;s nose relates to the size of his......)\n\nHere&amp;#039;s the IMDB:\nA modernisation of Edmond Rostands &quot;Cyrano De Bergerac&quot;. C.D. Bales is a fire chief, who just happens to have an enormous nose. He hires a new fire-fighter, Chris, who is handsome, and knows his hoses, but is useless when it comes to women. Roxanne is an astronomer who has just arrived in town. She catches the eye of Chris, and he asks C.D. to help him woo her. Little does Chris know that C.D. is mad about Roxanne, but hasn&amp;#039;t found the right way to tell her - yet.
