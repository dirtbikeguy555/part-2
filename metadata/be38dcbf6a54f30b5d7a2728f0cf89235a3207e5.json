Skynyrd never relied on the jazzy improvisations of the Allman Brothers. Instead, they were a hard-living, hard-driving rock &amp; roll band -- they may have jammed endlessly on-stage, but their music remained firmly entrenched in blues, rock, and country. For many, Lynyrd Skynyrd's redneck image tended to obscure the songwriting skills of their leader, Ronnie Van Zant. Throughout the band's early records, Van Zant demonstrated a knack for lyrical detail and a down-to-earth honesty that had more in common with country than rock &amp; roll. During the height of Skynyrd's popularity in the mid-'70s, however, Van Zant's talents were overshadowed by the group's gritty, greasy blues-rock. Sadly, it wasn't until he was killed in a tragic plane crash in 1977 along with two other bandmembers that many listeners began to realize his talents. Skynyrd split up after the plane crash, but they reunited a decade later, becoming a popular concert act during the early '90s. \n\nMixing country, a slight touch of blues and some good old vintage Southern rock, at their best Lynyrd Skynyrd were as good as any of the great Southern rock bands of the mid-'70s, and with a sly sense of what could work on pop radio, they managed to score several hits without sacrificing one bit of their musical integrity. \n\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nAuthorized Bootleg Live At The Cardiff Capitol Theater\nCardiff, Wales Nov. 04 1975  (2009)\nAudiochecker: 100.00% CDDA\n\nChristmas Time Again (2000)\nAudiochecker: 99.82% CDDA\n\nEdge Of Forever (1999)\nAudiochecker: 99.75% CDDA\n\nEndangered Species (1994)\nAudiochecker: 99.69% CDDA\n\nExtended Versions The Encore Collection (1998)\nAudiochecker: 99.90% CDDA\n\nFamily (2006)\nAudiochecker: 99.88% CDDA\n\nGimme Back My Bullets [Remaster] (1999)\nAudiochecker: 99.91% CDDA\n\nGod &amp; Guns (2009)\nAudiochecker: 100.00% CDDA\n\nLast Of A Dyin' Breed (2012)\nAudiochecker: 100.00% CDDA\n\nLive From Freedom Hall (2010)\nAudiochecker: 99.87% CDDA\n\nLynyrd Skynyrd 1991 (1991)\nAudiochecker: 100.00% CDDA\n\nLyve From Steel Town 2CD (1998)\nAudiochecker: 99.92% CDDA &amp; 78.20% CDDA\n\nNuthin' Fancy [Remaster] (1999)\nAudiochecker: 99.90% CDDA\n\nOne More From The Road 2CD [Deluxe Edition] (2001)\nAudiochecker: 99.92% CDDA &amp; 100.00% CDDA\n\nPronounced 'Leh-'NÃƒÂ©rd 'Skin-'NÃƒÂ©rd [Remaster] (2001)\nAudiochecker: 99.85% CDDA\n\nSecond Helping [Remaster] (1997)\nAudiochecker: 94.82% CDDA\n\nSkynyrd Nation (2011)\nAudiochecker: 99.90% CDDA\n\nSouthern By The Grace Of God - Tribute Tour 1987 (1988)\nAudiochecker: 99.55% CDDA\n\nSouthern Knights 2CD (1996)\nAudiochecker: 99.89% CDDA &amp; 100.00% CDDA\n\nStreet Survivors [Remaster] (2001)\nAudiochecker: 99.92% CDDA\n\nThe Last Rebel  (1993)\nAudiochecker: 100.00% CDDA\n\nTwenty (1997)\nAudiochecker: 99.75% CDDA\n\nVicious Cycle (2003)\nAudiochecker: 99.73% CDDA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            ****Thanks For Seeding!****\n                                     \n                                   ***Enjoy!***\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be38dcbf6a54f30b5d7a2728f0cf89235a3207e5","amp;dn":"Lynyrd+Skynyrd+-+23+CD+Discography+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be38dcbf6a54f30b5d7a2728f0cf89235a3207e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,56,220,191,106,84,243,11,93,122,39,40,240,207,137,35,90,50,7,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
