This stuff doesn't do so well in the U.S., but it's huge in Europe, where a track like this album's hit, &quot;I'll Fly with You,&quot; can top the charts from Spain to the Czech Republic. Unabashedly pop, D'Agostino is probably pooh-poohed by experimental DJs--making him laugh all the way to the bank. He does share one thing with many of today's artier electronic producers: an obsession with the 1980s. A cover of Nik Kershaw's 1984 song &quot;The Riddle&quot; won't raise many eyebrows, but then there's the left-field instrumental &quot;Rectangle,&quot; initially released by obscure French electro-pioneer Jacno in the early '80s. Wisely, D'Agostino more or less refrained from tarting up the song's elegant simplicity and tried his darnedest to preserve its hard-to-pin-down melancholia. Even more wisely, he actually uses it twice, first in a medley with &quot;La Passion&quot; and then in a straightforward cover. Can't get enough of a good thing\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img242.imageshack.us/img242/4855/gigidagostinolamourtoujnx3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img242.imageshack.us/img242/4855/gigidagostinolamourtoujnx3.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\nCD 1\n01.
