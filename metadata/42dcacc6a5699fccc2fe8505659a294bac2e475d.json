LafleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guidebook. ShouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t it be yours as well?\nWinning CEO A.G. Lafley is now back at the helm of consumer goods giant Procter &amp; Gamble. If you want to know the strategy heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll use to restore P&amp;G to its former dominanceÃ¢â‚¬â€read this book.\nPlaying to Win, a noted Wall Street Journal and Washington Post bestseller, outlines the strategic approach Lafley, in close partnership with strategic adviser Roger Martin, used to double P&amp;GÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sales, quadruple its profits, and increase its market value by more than $100 billion when Lafley was first CEO (he led the company from 2000 to 2009). The book shows leaders in any type of organization how to guide everyday actions with larger strategic goals built around the clear, essential elements that determine business successÃ¢â‚¬â€where to play and how to win.\nLafley and Martin have created a set of five essential strategic choices that, when addressed in an integrated way, will move you ahead of your competitors. They are: (1) What is our winning aspiration? (2) Where will we play? (3) How will we win? (4) What capabilities must we have in place to win? and (5) What management systems are required to support our choices? The result is a playbook for winning.\nThe stories of how P&amp;G repeatedly won by applying this method to iconic brands such as Olay, Bounty, Gillette, Swiffer, and Febreze clearly illustrate how deciding on a strategic approachÃ¢â‚¬â€and then making the right choices to support itÃ¢â‚¬â€makes the difference between just playing the game and actually winning.\nPlaying to Win outlines a proven method that has worked for some of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most celebrated brands and products. Let this book serve as your new guide to winning, as well.\nGenre: Non-Fiction&gt; Business&gt; Management &amp; Leadership \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42dcacc6a5699fccc2fe8505659a294bac2e475d","amp;dn":"Playing+to+Win_+How+Strategy+Really+Works+-+Lafley%2C+A.G.+%26amp%3B+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42dcacc6a5699fccc2fe8505659a294bac2e475d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,220,172,198,165,105,159,204,194,254,133,5,101,154,41,75,172,46,71,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
