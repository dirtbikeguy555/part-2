Both complex and soul-quenchingly simple in its raw, natural beauty, the continent canÃ¢Â€â„¢t fail to get under your skin. A large part of its appeal are its extreme landscapes: from the wild, watery theatre of the Okavango Delta to its arid counterpart, the Kalahari Desert.\r\n\r\nThen thereÃ¢Â€â„¢s the wildlife: the mountain gorillas of the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest in Uganda; the epic wildebeest migration from TanzaniaÃ¢Â€â„¢s Serengeti to the Maasai Mara in Kenya; the Kruger National Park, home to the Big Five. No matter how many times you visit, every trip to Africa is as compelling as the first.\r\n\r\nOur lead feature in The Africa Collection by National Geographic Traveller (UK) looks at the destinations and experiences that will be taking travellers by storm in 2017 â€” first stop, ZambiaÃ¢Â€â„¢s remote Luangwa Valley for a yoga safari. Elsewhere, we tour the continentÃ¢Â€â„¢s most colourful attractions, from a strawberry-hued lake in Senegal to an all-blue Moroccan town, and look at wildlife activities beyond the Big Five â€” dinner with giraffes, anyone?\r\n\r\nThe Africa Collection is part of a series of beautiful coffee table magazines distributed with National Geographic Traveller (UK), and also includes The Luxury Collection and The Spa &amp; Wellness Collection.\r\n\r\n=======================================\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/shtihl22\r\n\r\n=======================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:695cbcb453cf5898dddaa82efea8089b529c564c","amp;dn":"National+Geographic+Traveller+UK+-+September+2016+True+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"695cbcb453cf5898dddaa82efea8089b529c564c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,92,188,180,83,207,88,152,221,218,168,46,254,168,8,155,82,156,86,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
