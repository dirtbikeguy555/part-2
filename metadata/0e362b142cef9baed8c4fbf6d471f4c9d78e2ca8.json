Yentl (Streisand) is a young woman who wants nothing more than to study religious scripture. She is denied that possibility because she is a woman. She moves, passes herself off as a male named Anshel, and then begins her studies. She becomes close to fellow student Avigdor (Mandy Patinkin), eventually falling in love with him, although she can not reveal her true self as she would then be expelled. Avigdor is in love with Hadass (Amy Irving), but religious law forbids him from marrying her. Avigdor attempts to fix Anshel up with Hadass, leading to Hadass falling in love with Anshel. Yentl received four Academy Award nominations, including two Best Song nods.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086619/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086619/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-86619/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-86619/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 624x384\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1405 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,24 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e362b142cef9baed8c4fbf6d471f4c9d78e2ca8","amp;dn":"Yentl+%281983%29++Barbra+Streisand+Multisubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e362b142cef9baed8c4fbf6d471f4c9d78e2ca8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,54,43,20,44,239,155,174,216,196,251,246,212,113,244,201,215,142,44,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
