Jeevan Chaudhary, a paparazzo-turned-EMT, is in the audience and leaps to his aid. A child actress named Kirsten Raymonde watches in horror as Jeevan performs CPR, pumping ArthurÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chest as the curtain drops, but Arthur is dead. That same night, as Jeevan walks home from the theater, a terrible flu begins to spread. Hospitals are flooded and Jeevan and his brother barricade themselves inside an apartment, watching out the window as cars clog the highways, gunshots ring out, and life disintegrates around them.\n\nFifteen years later, Kirsten is an actress with the Traveling Symphony. Together, this small troupe moves between the settlements of an altered world, performing Shakespeare and music for scattered communities of survivors. Written on their caravan, and tattooed on KirstenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s arm is a line from Star Trek: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Because survival is insufficient.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ But when they arrive in St. Deborah by the Water, they encounter a violent prophet who digs graves for anyone who dares to leave.\n\nSpanning decades, moving back and forth in time, and vividly depicting life before and after the pandemic, this suspenseful, elegiac novel is rife with beauty. As Arthur falls in and out of love, as Jeevan watches the newscasters say their final good-byes, and as Kirsten finds herself caught in the crosshairs of the prophet, we see the strange twists of fate that connect them all. A novel of art, memory, and ambition, Station Eleven tells a story about the relationships that sustain us, the ephemeral nature of fame, and the beauty of the world as we know it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc2eb3df95166e04478cf968a72c5a9f653e55f5","amp;dn":"Emily+St.+John+Mandel+-+Station+Eleven","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc2eb3df95166e04478cf968a72c5a9f653e55f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,46,179,223,149,22,110,4,71,140,249,104,167,44,90,159,101,62,85,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
