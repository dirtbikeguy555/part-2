This release was compiled from two performances\r\nat the famed Fillmore West on February 7 &amp; 8, 1969. The album includes several songs\r\nnot found on the group's studio albums.\r\n\r\nRecorded less than a week after the release of The Byrds' album, Dr. Byrds &amp; Mr. Hyde,\r\nthe band line-up on these recordings includes lead singer and guitarist, Roger McGuinn,\r\nlead guitarist Clarence White, bassist John York, and drummer Gene Parsons. The album\r\nfeatures White's use of the Stringbender device, which he co-invented with drummer\r\n[and banjo player] Gene Parsons.
