As with its sister textbook, Discovering Statistics Using SAS takes the entry level student from first principles right the way through to advanced level statistical concepts all the while grounding knowledge through the use of SAS. Its approach is to teach statistical concepts as well as the computational principles, commands and language of the SAS software package in one textbook, and given this comprehensive coverage this textbook should be enthusiastically adopted on a wide variety of statistics courses. \n\nPublication Date: February 25, 2010\nISBN-10: 1849200920\nISBN-13: 978-1849200929\n\n2010kaiser home page at The Pirate Bay link below:\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2010kaiser/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!
