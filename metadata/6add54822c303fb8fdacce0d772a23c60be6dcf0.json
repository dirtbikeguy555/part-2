The quartet members, all of whom met at Leeds University, spent two years rehearsing before inking a deal with Infectious Records in 2011. The group's signature blend of layered, folk-inflected dub-pop and soaring alternative rock, which has been compared to everyone from the Wild Beasts and Hot Chip to Coldplay, was first heard on the 2012 singles &quot;Matilda&quot; and &quot;Fitzpleasure.&quot; The group's full-length studio debut, An Awesome Wave, arrived later that year and went on to earn them the prestigious Mercury Prize, alongside three Brit Award nominations. The following year the four-piece embarked on a string of shows worldwide, including dates in Australia, Singapore, America, and Europe. However, the heavy touring schedule and increasing success eventually led to bassist Gwil Sainsbury's departure at the turn of the year. The remaining trio continued undeterred and their sophomore record, This Is All Yours, was expected for release toward the end of 2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6add54822c303fb8fdacce0d772a23c60be6dcf0","amp;dn":"Alt-J+-+This+Is+All+Yours+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6add54822c303fb8fdacce0d772a23c60be6dcf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,221,84,130,44,48,63,184,253,172,206,13,119,42,35,198,11,230,220,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
