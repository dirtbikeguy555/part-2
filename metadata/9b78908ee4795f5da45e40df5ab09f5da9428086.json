In Hot Blooded, she transports listeners into the heart of New Orleans, where a deluded murderer is on a holy quest of vengeance. Dr. Samantha Leeds hosts her own late-night radio talk-show on WSLJ. One day she receives a menacing phone call at her home, while miles away, a prostitute is strangled to death. Seemingly unrelated, nobody connects the two events until more murders occur under similar circumstances. Dr. Sam soon realizes that someone from her past is stalking towards her, armed with a rosary and a deep-seeded hatred. Sam must rely on her wits, and a friendship with her mysterious new neighbor, Ty Wheeler, if she wants to escape the killer's wrath. Filled with sensational suspense, Hot Blooded is a sizzling departure from the usual romance novel. Alyssa Bresnahan's steamy narration takes listeners deep into the murky Bayou swamps and the terrifying secrets within","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b78908ee4795f5da45e40df5ab09f5da9428086","amp;dn":"Lisa+Jackson-Hot+Blooded","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b78908ee4795f5da45e40df5ab09f5da9428086","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,120,144,142,228,121,95,93,164,94,64,223,90,176,159,93,169,66,128,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
