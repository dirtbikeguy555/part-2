Erhan (AOCS, 2005).pdf\r\n\r\nIndustrial Uses of Vegetable Oils offers new insights into these important (and growing) products of vegetable oils. The author focuses on recent research and development of new industrial products, including the use of vegetable oils in paint and coatings, printing inks, engine oils, and biodiesel for heating and engine applications. The book discusses whether or not vegetable-based engine oils and biodiesel are practical or not. Topics also include the genetic modification of seed oils, developments in biodegradable grease, vegetable oils-based polyols, the development of biodiesel and soy composites, and the synthesis of surfactants from vegetable oil feedstocks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1dee2b98405c01722cdbff22e682b555cc33ee74","amp;dn":"Industrial+Uses+of+Vegetable+Oil+-+Sevim+Z.+Erhan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1dee2b98405c01722cdbff22e682b555cc33ee74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,238,43,152,64,92,1,114,44,219,255,34,230,130,181,85,204,51,238,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
