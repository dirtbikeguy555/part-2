When he tells her he found another career woman and is willing to stick it out with her and is engaged to her. Beth feels that there is no one for her. And when she goes to Rome to attend her sister's impromptu wedding and after meeting the best man, Nick she's attracted to him but after seeing him with another woman, she gets drunk and goes into the famed Fountain of Love and takes some coins thrown by people looking for love. When she goes back to New York four men start coming onto her. And Nick keeps calling her asking her out. She later learns that what she did--is a no no. It seems legend says that if you take a coins out of the fountain the person who threw it will fall in love with who took the coin. So she has to find a way to break the curse. And she wonders if Nick whom she likes is with her cause he wants to or is he under the spell.\n \nScreenshots:\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/YRVZn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/YRVZn.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8xbDW.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/8xbDW.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/CNSyP.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/CNSyP.png&lt;/a&gt;\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\t\n \nYIFY Team;\nEncoded by sundox\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9075d18e32d11a9c15effe1f7c0151624c680997","amp;dn":"When+in+Rome+%282010%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+1.4GB+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9075d18e32d11a9c15effe1f7c0151624c680997","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,117,209,142,50,209,26,156,21,239,254,31,124,1,81,98,76,104,9,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
