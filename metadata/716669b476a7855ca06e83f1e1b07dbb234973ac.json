And in the end I decided that there are few factors: itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s their primitive and unmusical beats, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s their lacklustre barking vocals, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s their lack of creative impulse and at last itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the sameness of their uninspired stuff. What is on their side then? Is it their wish to sound original? But as the saying goes the road to hell is paved with good intentions.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/24/bombay-bicycle-club/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/24/bombay-bicycle-club/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:716669b476a7855ca06e83f1e1b07dbb234973ac","amp;dn":"Bombay+Bicycle+Club...+I+Had+The+Blues+But+I+Shook+Them+Loose%2820","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"716669b476a7855ca06e83f1e1b07dbb234973ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,102,105,180,118,167,133,92,160,110,131,241,225,176,125,187,35,73,115,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
