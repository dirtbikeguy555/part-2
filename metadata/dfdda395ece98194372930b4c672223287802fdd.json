I double checked \nthe episode order/names and checked most files for sync \nissues. I noticed in Vol. 4 most of the intros are slightly \nout of sync. It's very easy to spot when Bugs Bunny eats his \ncarrot or the lightning at the end of the intro. That's the \nway it is on the source. Not sure why. However, the &quot;meat&quot; \nof these episodes seem totaly fine. Other then that \neverything else seems to be in order. If i ever re-rip an \nepisode i will tag it with .V2-OLLIE.avi and re-upload the \nentire torrent.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nOMG! You kept everything in the order of the DVDs!?\n\nI did a little research before i started this project and\nthere are 3 ways of thinking when it comes to the order.\n\nOption #1: Should we go by the production order as listed \non the B:TAS site, which leaves gaps in between some \ntwo-parters? For instance, &quot;Two-Face Pt.1 &amp; 2,&quot; which, \naccording to some people should be watched as separate \nepisodes because there is a several month lapse in time on \nthe show from when Harvey becomes Two-Face to when he \npresents himself as a bad guy, and during this time he \ndevelops a gang and credibility. Also, when going by \nproduction order, &quot;Christmas with the Joker&quot; is #2, and \nincludes Robin, who then disappears in the following \nepisodes. Does this mean that the air-date order is \ncorrect instead?\n\nOption #2: Should we go by the air-date order? Was the \nair-date order the way the creators intended us to watch \nthem, or was this just the network presenting them the way \nTHEY wanted too. One thing to keep in mind, A LOT of shows, \nlive-action and animated are made and produced out of order, \nso could that be the case with B:TAS? Were they just \nproduced out of order and aired the way the creators \nintended? Also, there are contradictions on the B:TAS site \nas well. The episode guide, is presented in production order, \nhowever during the introduction on the first page, it talks \nabout how Harley Quinn showed up in episode #7 &quot;Joker's \nFavor&quot;, which is true, but only if you're going by the \nair-date order.\n\nOption #3: Should we go by the order on the DVDs? This is \nthe same as the production order, with the exception that \nall of the two-parters are together, instead of some of them \nbeing separated as they are in the production order. An \nexample of this would be &quot;The Cat and the Claw Pt.1 &amp; 2&quot; \nwhich are separated in the production order, with two \nepisodes between them, but they are joined back-to-back on \nthe DVD order. Same with the &quot;Two-Face Pt.1 &amp; 2&quot; episodes, \nwhich are spread out in the production order with five \nepisodes between the two parts, but also joined back-to-back \non the DVD order.\n\nTake your pick! I picked option 3.\n\nI also included all 3 of the feature films. As far as i can \ntell the best order to watch everything in is ...\n\n1. Batman: The Animated Series (episodes 1-60) \n2. Batman: Mask of the Phantasm \n3. Batman: The Animated Series (episodes 61-85) \n4. Batman &amp; Mr. Freeze: SubZero \n5. The New Batman Adventures (Vol. 4)\n6. Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman \n\nbut what the fuck do i know!!!??? :)\n------------------------------------------------------------\nI ripped and uploaded these for a few friends that wanted me\nto. I decided to put them on a public tracker in the off \nchance anyone else wanted them as well. I'm well aware there \nare other torrents of this series. Most of them are IMO not \ndone right. If for some reason you don't like how i did it..\nDon't fucking download it. I don't really care if you think \nthe file size is wrong, you prefer mp3, or different\nresolutions. Take it or leave it :)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n&quot;I think the most convincing proof that intelligent life \nexists elsewhere in the universe is that none of it has \ncontacted us.&quot; - Calvin &amp; Hobbes\n------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfdda395ece98194372930b4c672223287802fdd","amp;dn":"Batman.The.Complete.Animated.Series.DVDRip.XviD-OLLIE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfdda395ece98194372930b4c672223287802fdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,221,163,149,236,233,129,148,55,41,48,180,198,114,34,50,135,128,47,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
