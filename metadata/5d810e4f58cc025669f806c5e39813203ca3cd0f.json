His public persona ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the character he played both in his songs and his movies ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ was of a humorous mobster with a penchant for whisky and women.\n\nAfter perfecting his routine in night clubs and theatres he started recording his songs in 1955; the first single (a shellac 78rpm record containing 'Che bambola' and 'Giacomino') sold 1,000,000 copies with close to no promotion, propelling him to a degree of fame he never considered possible.\n\nBy the end of 1950s, Buscaglione was one of Italy's most wanted entertainers. He appeared on advertising campaigns, on television, in movies.\n\nAt 38 years of age he was killed in a car accident when his pink Ford Thunderbird collided with a truck in the early hours before dawn in Rome, of all places, right before the U.S. embassy.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/8841/rmcd4441watermark.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img834.imageshack.us/img834/8841/rmcd4441watermark.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n01 Eri piccola cosi'\n02 Teresa non sparare\n03 Guarda che luna\n04 Che bambola\n05 Whisky facile\n06 Love in Portofino\n07 Buonasera\n08 Porfirio Villarosa\n09 Il dritto di Chicago\n10 Criminalmente bella\n11 Che notte\n12 Al chiar di luna porta fortuna\n13 Una sigaretta\n14 Carina\n15 Non partir\n16 Le Rififi'","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d810e4f58cc025669f806c5e39813203ca3cd0f","amp;dn":"Fred+Buscaglione+-+Che+bambola+%5BMp3+320+kbps%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d810e4f58cc025669f806c5e39813203ca3cd0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,129,14,79,88,204,2,86,105,248,6,197,227,152,19,32,60,163,205,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
