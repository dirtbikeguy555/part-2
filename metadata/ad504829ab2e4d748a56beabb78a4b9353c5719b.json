It features twelve of Nas' singles from his Columbia releases from Illmatic to Street's Disciple and two new tracks. Nas' 2006 studio album Hip Hop Is Dead was overlooked because it was released by Def Jam and not Columbia. Nastradamus and The Lost Tapes were also left out. The collaboration made with Cee-Lo for the Rush Hour 3 soundtrack is also included on the album. Greatest Hits debuted at #124 on the Billboard 200, selling about 6,800 copies, and #20 on the Billboard Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. As of August 2008 the compilation has sold over 20,000 copies in the U.S.\n\nThe cover features lyrics from his hit single &quot;If I Ruled the World (Imagine That)&quot; which appears on the compilation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad504829ab2e4d748a56beabb78a4b9353c5719b","amp;dn":"Nas+-+Greatest+Hits+%282007%29+320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad504829ab2e4d748a56beabb78a4b9353c5719b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,80,72,41,171,46,77,116,138,86,190,171,183,138,75,147,83,197,113,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
