Too bad it&amp;#039;s the only memorable thing about the soundtrack. The remainder of the record is either devoted to &amp;#039;80s artifacts -- there&amp;#039;s really no other word for leftovers from Wang Chung or songs by Karla DeVito, Jesse Johnson, and Elizabeth Daily, or forgettable instrumentals by Keith Forsey. Ironically, the very fact that the soundtrack is disposable makes it all the more a time capsule and thereby interesting, but don&amp;#039;t expect to be blown away by anything outside of Simple Minds&amp;#039; undisputed masterpiece. By the way, nothing is more emblematic of the Reagan era than the fact that a worthy band became famous -- in fact, synonymous -- for a song they didn&amp;#039;t write.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01 - Don&amp;#039;t You (Forget About Me) - Simple Minds  [4:20]\n02 - Waiting - E.G.
