With the big man&amp;#039;s place at the top of the criminal hierarchy up for grabs, the city&amp;#039;s most heinous villains are out in force, clambering over each other for the new employment opportunity. Batman&amp;#039;s most dangerous opponents are causing a crime wave the likes of which Gotham has never seen. Nothing is as it seems. You can&amp;#039;t even be sure that the infamous Joker has really ceased to exist. Gotham&amp;#039;s safety hangs in the balance and only Batman can save it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5605d8d9cbd77ec23d57fcaeafcbc0fb0675ab0d","amp;dn":"Batman+Vengeance%28PC+GAME%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5605d8d9cbd77ec23d57fcaeafcbc0fb0675ab0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,5,216,217,203,215,126,194,61,87,252,174,175,203,192,251,6,117,171,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
