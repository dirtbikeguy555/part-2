Anthony goes on to talk about asses getting off the train, Obamaâ€™s new veto, Trump, Hillary, and meaningless information, Hillaryâ€™s possible debate cheating, stop and frisk, we hear from a few callers, and see a little kid cry-talking at about the police and community. Ant talks about video game movies, the upcoming movie Shooting Clerks, Trump calling out Rosie Oâ€™Donnell for being a fat ass, Katy Perry voting naked, a pubic proposal snafu, â€œbreaking newsâ€ on Marilyn Monroe, and we see Steve Buscemi eyes. We watch Tim Tebowâ€™s homer, hear Gabrielle Unionâ€™s thoughts on Amy Schumer, a caller talks about a rusty trombone feminist spitting something or other wtf, and Ant waxes on that stupid cunt feminist from that one video who deserves zero mentions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e265d87dc0bcc435c35571c2c4cf6d660481978b","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2016-09-28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e265d87dc0bcc435c35571c2c4cf6d660481978b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,101,216,125,192,188,196,53,195,85,113,194,196,207,109,102,4,129,151,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
