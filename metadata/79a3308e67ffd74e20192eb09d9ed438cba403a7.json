DyerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fans have wondered when he would write a memoir. Well, after four decades as a teacher of self-empowerment and the best-selling author of more than 40 books, Wayne has finally done just that! However, he has written it in a way that only he canÃ¢â‚¬â€with a remarkable take-home message for his longtime followers and new readers alikeÃ¢â‚¬â€and the result is an exciting new twist on the old format. Rather than a plain old memoir, Wayne has gathered together quantum-moment recollections.\n\nIn this revealing and engaging book, Wayne shares dozens of events from his life, from the time he was a little boy in Detroit up to present day. In unflinching detail, he relates his vivid impressions of encountering many forks in the road, taking readers with him into these formative experiences. Yet then he views the events from his current perspective, noting what lessons he ultimately learned, as well as how he has made the resulting wisdom available to millions via his lifelong dedication to service.\n\nAs a reader, you will feel as if you are right there with Wayne, perusing his personal photo album and hearing about his family, his time in the service, how he writes his best-selling books, and so much more. In the process, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be inspired to look back at your own life to see how everything you have experienced has led you to where you are right now.\n\nWayne has discovered that there are no accidents. Although we may not be aware of who or what is Ã¢â‚¬Å“moving the checkers,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ life has a purpose, and each step of our journey has something to teach us. As he says, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t aware of all of the future implications that these early experiences were to offer me. Now, from a position of being able to see much more clearly, I know that every single encounter, every challenge, and every situation are all spectacular threads in the tapestry that represents and defines my life, and I am deeply grateful for all of it.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nI Can See Clearly Now is an intimate look at an amazing teacher, but it also holds the key for seekers on a personal path of enlightenment. Wayne offers up his own life as an example of how we can all recognize the hand of the Divine steering our individual courses, helping us accomplish the mission we came here to fulfill.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79a3308e67ffd74e20192eb09d9ed438cba403a7","amp;dn":"I+Can+See+Clearly+Now-+Wayne+Dyer+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+PDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79a3308e67ffd74e20192eb09d9ed438cba403a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,163,48,142,103,255,215,78,32,25,46,176,157,158,212,56,203,164,3,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
