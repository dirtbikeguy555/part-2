It's inexpensive and not flashy but it has a bunch of classic camping songs I wanted my 4 year old daughter to learn before next summer's camping trips.\n\nAt times an adult sings and at other times children sing. I'm pleased with the selection of songs the producers choose to include. My daughter and I were both happily singing along to the songs after the first couple of times we listened to it. I recommend buying it.[/quote]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c948816c7f04c025061322113b8bba645b820ce","amp;dn":"Kids+Direct+-+Favorite+Camp+Songs+320cbr+%28Big+Papi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c948816c7f04c025061322113b8bba645b820ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,148,136,22,199,240,76,2,80,97,50,33,19,184,187,166,69,184,32,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
