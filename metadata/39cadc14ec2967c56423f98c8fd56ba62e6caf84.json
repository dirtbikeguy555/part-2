Though less sprawlingly ambitious than prior album Zen Arcade, New Day Rising, in some ways, abandoned hardcore punk entirely,[neutrality is disputed] and helped set the template for alternative rock  for the next decade. While retaining the speed and aggression of earlier efforts, many fans maintain that virtually all of the songs on New Day Rising exhibit a strong pop sensibility.[neutrality is disputed] Guitarist and lead singer Bob Mould\\'s trademark miasma of fuzz distortion is still present, but with much of the harsh rawness of previous efforts abandoned in favor of a more melodic sound.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img47.imageshack.us/img47/425/ndr9ho.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img47.imageshack.us/img47/425/ndr9ho.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n1 New Day Rising\n2 Girl Who Lives on Heaven Hill\n3 I Apologize\n4 Folklore\n5 If I Told You\n6 Celebrated Summer\n7 Perfect Example\n8 Terms of Psychic Warfare\n9 59 Times the Pain\n10 Powerline\n11 Books About UFOs\n12 I Don\\'t Know What You\\'re Talking About\n13 How to Skin a Cat\n14 Whatcha Drinkin\\'\n15 Plans I Make","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39cadc14ec2967c56423f98c8fd56ba62e6caf84","amp;dn":"Husker+Du+-+New+Day+Rising+%5BMp3+280+kbps+VBR%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39cadc14ec2967c56423f98c8fd56ba62e6caf84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,202,220,20,236,41,103,197,100,35,249,140,143,213,107,166,46,108,175,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
