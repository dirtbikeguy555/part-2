Working from within Windows, ZAR can recover FAT16/32 and NTFS (including NTFS5) volumes. ZAR supports long and/or national file names and NTFS compression. Typical recoverable damage profiles include volumes accidentally formatted, corrupted by a virus or ill-behaved software, due to power failure or as a side effect of overclocking and so on. There is no need to install the software prior to data loss. During DOS-mode operation, ZAR can aslo scan for and retrieve partitioning information from the damaged disk.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62b0b4e5048d67ff8ef37dc4fe4da0811b8484e5","amp;dn":"ZAR+8.3+With+working+Serial.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62b0b4e5048d67ff8ef37dc4fe4da0811b8484e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,176,180,229,4,141,103,255,142,243,125,196,254,77,160,129,27,132,132,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
