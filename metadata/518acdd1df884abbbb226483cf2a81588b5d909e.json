Born and raised in Hawthorne, California, he formed the Beach Boys in 1961 alongside his two younger brothers, cousin Mike Love, and school friend Alan Jardine. Serving as the group's primary songwriter, Wilson combined the rock urgency of Chuck Berry with the harmonies of the Four Freshmen before expanding his musical imagination during the late '60s, during which time he experimented with new songwriting structures and production techniques. Wilson retreated from his dominance of the Beach Boys after 1967, yielding most of the control to his younger brother Carl. (He made sporadic contributions to their records, returning only briefly in the 1970s and 2010s, the latter as part of a special 50th anniversary tour and album.) \n\n\nGenre................: Rock\nYear.................: 2015\nLabel.................: Capitol\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nIncluded.............: Front Cover, Folder.auCDtect\n\nTracks:\n\n01.This Beautiful Day\n02.Runaway Dancer (Feat.
