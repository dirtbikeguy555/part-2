Get ready for a two-dimensional   |\n          | role-playing adventure for the ages as Mario returns to  |\n          | paper form in pursuit of a threat unlike any he's ever   |\n          | faced.  This time around, more emphasis is placed on the |\n          | paper abilities of Mario and his friends. He can turn    |\n          | sideways to slip through cracks, fold into a paper       |\n          | airplane to fly, roll into a tube, and much more. He can |\n          | also use tons of items like hammers and thunderbolts.    |\n          |                                                          |\n          |                                                          |\n       (3)&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Release Notes:                                         &amp;lt;&amp;lt;)\n          |                                                          |\n          | Tested with Loader 1.0,  works great, we are wondering   |\n          | what kind of morons IGN has working for them to attack   |\n          | this game based on &amp;quot;Presentation&amp;quot; and because no texture |\n          | work...blah blah whatever they can pull out of their     |\n          | asses lately on biased reviews... wish Gamefan was back. |\n          | All this negativity about the gamecube scene, really     |\n          | makes us sad. We try to do whatever we can to at least   |\n          | bring some momentum, you can always trust us, we have    |\n          | the tools to know if an image is properly done that will |\n          | work correctly now, or even with future builds of the    |\n          | loader, or (gasp!) a modchip.
