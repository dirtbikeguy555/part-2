The modern user interface applying standard Windows rules serves to significantly improve user guidance and navigation.\n\nModern user interface using standard Windows rules\nUsers will immediately note the modern user interface and the simple navigation using standard Windows rules.\nYou can open functions using the icons (a) or the Menu bar (b).\nTooltips are provided to explain icon functions (c). Hovering the mouse pointer over an icon causes the tooltip to appear with a description of the icon's function.\nThe combined pull-down menus (d) with input fields are available in EPC net for simple navigation within the catalogs/groups/subgroups.\nYou can use your mouse or keyboard to operate EPC net. Most of the keyboard shortcuts used in EPC Flexible Publishing are also used in EPC net.\n\nFor parts identification, EPC net requires at least a 6-digit model designation.\nIdeally, parts identification should be done using a vehicle identification number so that the datacard can be used in the process. The datacard must be used when looking for parts that are color-specific or where the search depends on what equipment is installed in the vehicle.\n\nReduced number of windows\nFunctions that were spread over several windows in EPC Flexible Publishing have been condensed onto one window in EPC net.\n\nThe EPC net window is subdivided into the following sections:\n\nMercedes EPC net Picture\nThe picture has been supplemented with different zoom functions, and can be shown in a separate window using the icon.\n\nMercedes EPC net Parts list\nAll the part numbers for the entire subgroup are shown in the parts list.\nFootnotes and code information (passenger cars), SA/component information (commercial vehicles) and construction kit information (BUS) can be displayed via links in a separate window.\n\nMercedes EPC net Shopping list\nThe contents of the shopping list (e.g. quantity) can be changed directly in the individual columns.\n\nOne important new feature is the &quot;Show part context&quot; function. When you reopen a saved shopping list you can click on the part designation in the form of a mouse-sensitive blue link to extract the part context directly from the shopping list.This saves you the trouble of reentering the vehicle data and the group/subgroup.\n\nMercedes EPC net List overview\nThe &quot;List overview&quot; can help the EPC net users with shopping list administration.\nSaved shopping lists and a &quot;temporary shopping list&quot; can be used at the same time.\nThe icon can be used to create, show, delete, copy and print shopping lists.\n\nThe active area of the EPC net window is marked with a red frame.\nYou can change the size of the individual EPC net window areas via the respective dividing lines. Double-clicking on the dividing line between the picture and the parts list causes the picture to be arranged above the parts list.\n\nThe , and icons can be used to show/hide individual areas of the EPC net window and to individually change the column widths as required.\n\nEPC net is available both online and offline\nThe various options at a glance:\nOnline server operation via Internet or intranet.\nLocal installation: offline operation for day-to-day use - updates via online downloads.\nOffline mode: updates from DVD.\n\nAdvantages of spare parts catalogue Mercedes-Benz in EWA net interface.\n\nDescription of work in electronic spare parts catalogue Mercedes EPC net EWA.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.autoepc4you.com/uploads/screenshots/p/477/27c3b28b8f29d04ff6d531fb72412df3_en.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.autoepc4you.com/uploads/screenshots/p/477/27c3b28b8f29d04ff6d531fb72412df3_en.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.autoepc4you.com/uploads/screenshots/p/47","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63751dcafc2a8f8825ac1ce52ddb8fabe3f79126","amp;dn":"Mercedes+Benz+EWA+net+01+2012+%28EPC+%26amp%3B+WIZ%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63751dcafc2a8f8825ac1ce52ddb8fabe3f79126","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,117,29,202,252,42,143,136,37,172,28,229,45,219,143,171,227,247,145,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
