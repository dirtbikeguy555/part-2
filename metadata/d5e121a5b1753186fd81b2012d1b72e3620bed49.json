Many critics considered the show notable as one of the first sitcoms to portray a blue-collar American family with two parents working outside the home, as well as lead characters who were noticeably overweight without such being the target of jokes.[3][4] For many years, Roseanne tackled taboo subjects or joked about issues that most other popular shows at the time avoided, such as poverty, alcoholism, flatulence, drug abuse, sex, menstruation, birth control, teenage pregnancy, masturbation, obesity, abortion, race, social class, domestic violence, infidelity, and gay rights. The show was also significant for its portrayal of feminist ideals including a female-dominated household, a female lead whose likability did not rely on her appearance, relationships between female characters that were cooperative rather than competitive, and females openly expressing themselves without negative consequences.\n\nThis is in MKV format\nUse vlc media player to play these\nPlease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5e121a5b1753186fd81b2012d1b72e3620bed49","amp;dn":"Roseanne+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5e121a5b1753186fd81b2012d1b72e3620bed49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,225,33,165,177,117,49,134,253,129,178,1,45,27,114,227,98,11,237,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
