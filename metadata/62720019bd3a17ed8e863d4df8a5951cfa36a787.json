If the next TPB owner will impose fees I will delete them all again.\n\nI apologize for the low upload speed. It will take you days to download, so be warned and dont bother with silly comments about shares and seeds.\n\nI see also that most of the leechers download practically from all my torrents, once they have started to download from one. Ok pals, but dont forget to keep those torrents seeded once you finish them if you want I upload more music. Surely I won't always keep uploading the whole bunch continously... so it's up to you to help these shares to spread.\n\n___________________________\n\n\n________________________________\n\n\nI upload here the Screaming Trees discography just uploaded by SoulCrusher657 with\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4564085/Screaming_Trees_Discography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4564085/Screaming_Trees_Discography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nand always stuck at 90% since months.\n\nThe ever missing or incomplete files (the 25 rarities) are added after the link provided by\n\nmikeofdoom at 2009-02-02 19:01 CET: \n \n\n\nEnjoy!\n\n_______________________\n\n\nAll of the Screaming Trees albums, including the unreleased 1999 album, three EPs, a greatest hits albums, and 25 rarities (which include covers, unreleased tracks, and live versions). Although the may ver well be &quot;forgotten&quot; Seattle band, these guys are just as brilliant if not more so than anything being released at this time. The greatest hits album, Ocean of Confusion, is perhaps the best album to start with if you are new to the band. If you would rather try an album first, however, I would start with Sweet Oblivion then work my way back or forward. These folks deserve your everlasting respect, along with your money.\n\ncontains: \n(1985) Other World (EP)\n(1986) Clairvoyance\n(1987) Even If and Especially When\n(1988) Beat Happening/Screaming Trees (EP)\n(1988) Invisible Lantern\n(1989) Change Has Come (EP)\n(1989) Buzz Factory\n(1991) Uncle Anesthesia\n(1992) Sweet Oblivion*\n(1996) Dust\n(1999) Unreleased Album*\n(2005) Ocean of Confusion (Greatest Hits)\n25 Rarities\n\nmp3\t\n\n(browse all my torrents:\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/n0b0dyh0me/&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\nfor private posts:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=113028&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=113028&lt;/a&gt;\n\n)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62720019bd3a17ed8e863d4df8a5951cfa36a787","amp;dn":"Screaming+Trees+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62720019bd3a17ed8e863d4df8a5951cfa36a787","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,114,0,25,189,58,23,237,142,134,61,77,248,165,149,28,250,54,167,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
