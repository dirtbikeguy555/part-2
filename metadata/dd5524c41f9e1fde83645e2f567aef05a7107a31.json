A man is not just a thing to beÃ¢â‚¬â€œit is also a way to be, a path to follow and a way to walk.\n\nPeople are talking about Ã¢â‚¬Å“the end of men,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“the decline of males,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the so-called Ã¢â‚¬Å“crisis of masculinity.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ There are many diagnoses for the troubles men face today, but the chattering class is short on solutions. They refuse to deal honestly with the differences between men and women, and fail to entertain the possibility that their vision of the future offers little of value to average males.\n\nThe Way of Men answers the question Ã¢â‚¬Å“What is masculinity?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nDonovan concludes that The Way of Men is the way of the primal survival gang. The simple, amoral, tactical virtues of the gang define our most basic conception of manliness. The Ã¢â‚¬Å“crisis of masculinityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is really a timeless push-and-pull between masculinity and civilization. The world has changed more than men have, and the security and luxury of modernity have put us conflict with our own natures. The path back to honor for men may lead through a new dark age.\n\n---\n\nInformation:\nASIN: B005FLU4ZA (Kindle Edition)\nISBN: 0985452307 (Paperback)\nFormat: ePub 2.0\nSize: 251 kB\n\n---\nComment:\nOkay, so Jack Donovan is gay as hell. I know. But so what? He is probably more of a man than most of you, at least he obviously knows in theory what manhood is all about. He makes that clear by writing this book. I don't know him, and probably never will - so I can't really say.\n\nAfter all, it's rude talking about people behind their backs. Or whatever.\n\nAnyway. Here you go. Grab the book. It should work on most ePub readers, like the stock one in your smartphone or tablet, or by installing a reader like Aldiko, or using one like Adobe Digital Editions on your desktop computer, or even through a plugin like Readium on browsers like Google Chrome. Simply download/upload (to device) and import. If you can't manage that, you will never be a man. Period.\n\nTake a look at the man's website: www.jack-donovan.com, and show him some gratitude by buying a T-shirt or whatever.
