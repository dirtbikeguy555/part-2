A pass rusher who leaves a would-be blocker in his wake on the way to sacking the quarterback. A setter who manages to maneuver both body and ball in the blink of an eye to make the perfect pass for the kill and match-winning point. These are all reasons agility and quickness are such prized physical attributes in modern sport. \n\n Efforts to become markedly quicker or more agile, however, arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always successful. Genetic limitations, technical deficiencies, and inferior training activities are among the major obstacles. \n\nDeveloping Agility and Quickness helps athletes blow past those barriers thanks to the top sport conditioning authority in the world, the National Strength and Conditioning Association. NSCA hand-picked its top experts to present the best training advice, drills, and programs for optimizing athletesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ linear and lateral movements. Make Developing Agility and Quickness a key part of your conditioning program, and get a step ahead of the competition.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab3850ae1743937cac1092a5e8f5967e65dd1d8b","amp;dn":"Powerlifting+%2B+Developing+Agility%2C+Speed+and+Quickness+-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab3850ae1743937cac1092a5e8f5967e65dd1d8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,56,80,174,23,67,147,124,172,16,146,165,232,245,150,126,101,221,29,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
