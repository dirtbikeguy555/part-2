The Lean Entrepreneur shows you how to become one. Most of us believe entrepreneurial visionaries are born, not made. Our media glorify business outliers like Bezos, Branson, Gates, and Jobs as heroes with X-ray vision who can look to the future, see clearly what will be, imagine a fully formed product or experience, and then simply make the vision real. Many in our entrepreneur community still believe that to be visionary, we must merely execute on a seemingly good idea and ignore all doubt.\n\n\nWith this mindset, companies build doomed products in a vacuum; enterprises make ill-fated innovation investment decisions; and employees and shareholders come along for an uncomfortable ride. Falling prey to the Myth of the Visionary confuses talented entrepreneurs, product managers, innovators, and investors. It leads us to heartbreaking, costly, and preventable failures in new product and venture development.\nThe Lean Entrepreneur moves us beyond this myth. It combines powerful customer insight, rapid experimentation, and easily actionable data from the Lean Startup methodology to empower individuals, companies, and entire teams to evolve their vision, solve problems, and create value at the speed of the Internet. Anyone can be visionary.\n\nThe Lean Entrepreneur shows you how to:\nApply actionable tips, tricks, and hacks from successful lean entrepreneurs\nLeverage the Innovation Spectrum to disrupt existing markets and create new ones\nDrive strategies for efficient market testing with Minimal Viable Products\nEngage customers with Viability Testing and radically reduce the time and budget for product development\nRapidly create cross-functional innovation teams that devour roadblocks and set new benchmarks\nBring your organization critical focus on the power of loyal customers and valuable products you can build to serve them ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76fcae48d1cc04762b1e37ad41e8bd57eb9c04c6","amp;dn":"The+Lean+Entrepreneur+Audiobook+by+Cooper+%26amp%3B+Vlaskovits+2013+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76fcae48d1cc04762b1e37ad41e8bd57eb9c04c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,252,174,72,209,204,4,118,43,30,55,173,65,232,189,87,235,156,4,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
