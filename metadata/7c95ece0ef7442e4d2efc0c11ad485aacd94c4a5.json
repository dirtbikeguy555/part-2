Frenzied by their terrible experiences with Wehrmacht and SS brutality, they wreaked havocâ€”tanks crushing refugee columns, mass rape, pillage, and unimaginable destruction. Hundreds of thousands of women and children froze to death or were massacred; more than seven million fled westward from the fury of the Red Army. It was the most terrifying example of fire and sword ever known. \r\n\r\nAntony Beevor has reconstructed the experiences of those millions caught up in the nightmare of the Third Reich's final collapse. The Fall of Berlin is a terrible story of pride, stupidity, fanaticism, revenge, and savagery, yet it is also one of astonishing endurance, self-sacrifice, and survival against all odds","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c95ece0ef7442e4d2efc0c11ad485aacd94c4a5","amp;dn":"Berlin%3A+The+Downfall+1945","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c95ece0ef7442e4d2efc0c11ad485aacd94c4a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,149,236,224,239,116,66,228,210,239,192,193,26,212,133,170,205,148,196,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
