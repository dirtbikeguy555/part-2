Do you have panic attacks that make you feel as though you are about to lose control? You are not alone. In fact, anxiety disorders are among the most common mental health conditions faced by our society. Perhaps youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve tried therapy or medication and have not found any real, lasting relief for your symptoms. So where do you go from here?\n\nCalming the Rush of Panic will introduce you to the practices of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) - a proven-effective meditational method developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn - as a way to work through episodes of panic. After an informative introduction to MBSR, you will be guided through a number of exploratory practices and meditations to transform your panic into peace.&quot; Each chapter in the book contains informational background on the topic, guided meditations, and up to 10 practices that let you put the information and skills you will learn into action.\n\nThe book promotes mindfulness-based practices and exercises to help you deal with the physical, emotional, and mental effects of panic, and inside you will learn foundational MBSR meditation practices, including mindful breathing, sitting meditation, and loving-kindness meditation. If your fear response is out of sync with the situations you find yourself in, this book will show you that your thoughts are just thoughts - they are just one part of you.\n\nThis quick, accessible book is the first to use an MBSR approach to specifically target panic attacks and panic disorder, and its goal is to show you what exists beyond your panic - a life filled with a greater sense of calm, connection, and happiness.\n\nAuthor:\n\nBob Stahl founded Awareness and Relaxation Training in 1991 as an educational organization based in Santa Cruz, CA. and has founded seven mindfulness-based stress reduction programs in the San Francisco Bay Area and currently directs MBSR programs at Dominican Hospital, El Camino Hospital, and O'Connor Hospital.\n\nDr. Stahl is a certified MBSR teacher who also serves as an Adjunct Senior Teacher for Oasis - the institute for mindfulness-based professional education and innovation of the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Bob conducts numerous mindfulness meditation retreats and workshops for health care professionals, corporations, and educational institutions and has extensive experience working with individuals facing physical disabilities, chronic pain, life-threatening illnesses, and stress-related conditions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eeadf8108ef441626b0ec3206bc584cbc06dd541","amp;dn":"Calming+The+Rush+Of+Panic+-+A+Mindfulness+Based+Stress+Reduction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eeadf8108ef441626b0ec3206bc584cbc06dd541","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,173,248,16,142,244,65,98,107,14,195,32,107,197,132,203,192,109,213,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
