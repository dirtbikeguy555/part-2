These reworkings of NicksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ vintage unheard material have been co-produced by Nicks, EurythmicsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Dave Stewart and guitar great Waddy Wachtel. According to an interview with the Associated Press, NicksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ inspiration actually came from viewing bootlegs of these songs on YouTube, leading her to make the decision to fully record them anew. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I call them my Ã¢â‚¬â„¢24 karat goldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ songs,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she commented. Most were written between 1969 and 1987, with a couple of tunes dating to 1994-1995. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Each song is a lifetime. Each song has a soul. Each song has a purpose. Each song is a love story,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Nicks remarked in a press release. Ã¢â‚¬Å“They represent my life behind the scenes, the secrets, the broken hearts, the broken hearted and the survivors. These songs are the memories Ã¢â‚¬â€ the 24 karat gold rings in the blue box. These songs are for you.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97e9cabdf0b8d39e95bd8fcee6c17a16f23eb0a2","amp;dn":"Stevie+Nicks+-+24+Karat+Gold+Songs+from+the+Vault+%5BDeluxe+Editio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97e9cabdf0b8d39e95bd8fcee6c17a16f23eb0a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,233,202,189,240,184,211,158,149,189,143,206,230,193,122,22,242,62,176,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
