The system is centered around four main ideas: anticipation, graduated interval recall, core vocabulary, and organic learning.\n\nThe Pimsleur method is an audio-based system, in which the listener constructs phrases or repeats from memory out loud along with a recording. The system, as currently implemented by Simon &amp; Schuster, is made up of multiple thirty-minute lessons, which are repeated until 80% comprehension is attained, at which point the user may continue to the next lesson. As the lessons repeat themselves and add new material, the method does not demand complete mastery of the material before moving on.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcd3d45fe628881ae623d507e6baa833dcd7921f","amp;dn":"Pimsleur+-+Dutch+I+%28Lessons+1-30%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcd3d45fe628881ae623d507e6baa833dcd7921f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,211,212,95,230,40,136,26,230,35,213,7,230,186,168,51,220,215,146,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
