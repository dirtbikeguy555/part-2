Freely goes on to show how, beginning in the twelfth century, these texts by Islamic scholars were then translated from Arabic into Latin, sparking the emergence of modern science at the dawn of the Renaissance, which climaxed in the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a76c0d9f7c0eec8e5175f06d4a35d0ab084f12bc","amp;dn":"Aladdin%27s+Lamp%3A+How+Greek+Science+Came+to+Europe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a76c0d9f7c0eec8e5175f06d4a35d0ab084f12bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,108,13,159,124,14,236,142,81,117,240,109,74,53,208,171,8,79,18,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
