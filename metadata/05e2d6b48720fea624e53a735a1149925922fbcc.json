It is consciously written in a clear, informal, and direct style designed to talk to the reader and to gain his or her immediate interest in the challenging and yet beautiful discipline of aerodynamics. The explanation of each topic is carefully constructed to make sense to the reader. Moreover, the structure of each chapter is highly organized in order to keep the reader aware of where we are, where we were, and where we are going. Too frequently the student of aerodynamics loses sight of what is trying to be accomplished; to avoid this, we attempt to keep the reader informed of our intent at all times. For example, virtually each chapter contains a road map-a block diagram designed to keep the reader well aware of the proper flow of ideas and concepts. The use of such chapter road maps is one of the unique features of this book. Also, to help organize the reader's thoughts, there are special summary sections at the end of most chapters.
