A stalwart Avenger, valued member of the FF, savior of the world on more than one occasion, she's also a killer attorney with a pile of degrees and professional respect. A 7-foot-tall drink of cool, emerald water, she's tough enough to knock out Galactus with one punch (possibly?) and has a heart bigger than the moon. But juggling cases and kicking bad guy butt is starting to be a little more complicated than she anticipated. With a new practice, a new paralegal and a mounting number of super villains she's racking up as personal enemies, She Hulk might have bitten off a little more than she can chewÃ¢â‚¬Â¦but she just calls that that Tuesday.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9107e54d9729d7729f028297bc15977ed9d0e6c2","amp;dn":"She-Hulk+001+%282014%29+%28Digital%29+%28BlackManta-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9107e54d9729d7729f028297bc15977ed9d0e6c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,7,229,77,151,41,215,114,159,2,130,151,188,21,151,126,217,208,230,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
