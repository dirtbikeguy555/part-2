Central to the WCML is its 399-mile (642 km)-long core section between London Euston and Glasgow Central[1] with principal InterCity stations at Warrington Bank Quay, Wigan, Preston, Lancaster, Oxenholme, Penrith and Carlisle. The length of the WCML's main core section is nominally quoted as being 401.25 miles (645.7 km). The basis of this measurement is taken as being the distance between the midpoint of Platform 18 of London Euston to that of Platform 1 of Glasgow Central, and has historically been the distance used in official calculations during speed record attempts. \n\nThe line was electrified during the 1960s and after subsequent upgrade programmes, now features a mixture of Mk1 and UK1 catenary equipment. Much of the line has a maximum speed of 125mph (201km/h) meaning Class 390 Pendolinos and Class 221 Ã¢â‚¬ËœSuper VoyagersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ can make the journey in a little over five hours. It is also one of the busiest freight routes in Europe, carrying more than 40% of all UK rail freight traffic. \n\nThe Trent Valley Line was opened in 1847 to give a more direct route from London to the North West of England, bypassing the existing route via Birmingham built by the Grand Junction Railway and the London and Birmingham Railway a decade earlier. \n\nConnecting the towns of Rugby, Nuneaton, Atherstone, Polesworth, Tamworth. Lichfield Trent Valley, Rugeley Trent Valley and Stafford, the line follows its namesake, the River Trent, and criss-crossing the Oxford, Coventry, and Trent and Mersey Canals along the way. \n\nThe line was electrified in the 1960s and was primarily four-track along the 60 mile distance. However, prior to 2004, the line had an 11 mile (18 km) section of track between Tamworth and Armitage that was only double track. A programme of engineering works upgraded the full line to four tracks, allowing more train capacity on this busy route. \n\nThe 60 mile (96km) WCML Trent Valley route from Thomson Interactive is set in the present day with full overhead electrification, from Stafford to Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal (DIRFT)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2351e2f8c1528194fdede54f028eff1192cb00d8","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2015+WCML+Trent+Valley+Route+Add-On","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2351e2f8c1528194fdede54f028eff1192cb00d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,81,226,248,193,82,129,148,253,237,229,79,2,142,255,17,146,203,0,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
