Version 8 continues the tradition with cool, new features that don't bog down the app with any additional complexity. Camtasia's price--$300--may raise eyebrows, but make no mistake: this screencasting software is serious business. New and advanced users both should be able to learn the software and start producing professionally looking videos in little time.\n\nRobust in-app tutorials introduce Camtasia to users, but experienced editors can wave them aside and dive in. The main interface is arranged logically, with the top-right corner reserved for the vast array of editing and production options: view your clips, manage your video library, or configure settings for zooming, panning, audio, and video transitions, or browse a myriad of including templates, music, and outros offered free by Digital Juice.\n\nRecent versions of Camtasia added features for recording system audio, automatically resizing windows, and a &quot;Smart Focus&quot; option that highlights key video frames and captions. Version 8 adds in smoother, 30fps captures, interactive &quot;Hotspots&quot; on videos, unlimited tracks for multitrack editing, a new TSC2 codec, and &quot;Quizzing,&quot; a feature that lets users provide instant feedback on your screecast videos.\n\nCamtasia allows exporting for nearly any sort of device or system: Web, phones, tablets, DVDs, and other mobile devices are all covered. The remarkably useful online help center is icing on the video-editing cake.\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\n\nTested And Working...\nScanned (With Kaspersky) And 100% Clean.\n\n(If You Found Something &quot;Un-Clean&quot; In Any Of My Torrents, Consider That It May Be A False Positive(Alert) And If you Are Sure Please Report It To Me So I Would Remove It)\n\n[Please Leave A Comment Confirming This Pack]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee80418eeef82b5afa4669857a141c61c9f86b56","amp;dn":"Camtasia+Studio+v8.0.2.918+%2B+Serials+%5BChattChitto+RG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee80418eeef82b5afa4669857a141c61c9f86b56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,128,65,142,238,248,43,90,250,70,105,133,122,20,28,97,201,248,107,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
