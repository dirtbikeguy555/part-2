Some years have passed, and the Gruffalo lives in a cave surrounded by woods. His child is coming to the age where she wants to explore beyond their familiar clearing, but, concerned for her safety, her father warns her not to go into the deep, dark woods. If she does, the Big Bad Mouse will be after her. One wild and windy night, the Gruffalo's child ignores her father's warnings and bravely tiptoes out into the snow in search of the fabled Mouse. In turn she meets malevolent Snake, pedantic Owl and cowardly Fox. Disturbed by her presence, all want to get rid of her, so all mislead her. Cold and tired, she is about to give up when she spots Mouse. Not 'big' or 'bad', but something to eat at least. About to become her midnight feast, Mouse is forced to think quickly. He sees the moon emerging from clouds and has an idea. Using shadows, he conjures up the Big Bad Mouse and gives the Gruffalo's child the fright of her life. As she runs away screaming, her fear gradually turns to delight - the Big Bad Mouse really does exist. Back home in the warmth and safety of their cave, she happily snuggles up to a snoring Gruffalo, who has remained soundly asleep throughout.
