This title will be released on May 24, 2011.\n\n\n\nAfter goth pioneers the Birthday Party called it quits in 1983, singer/songwriter Nick Cave assembled the Bad Seeds, a post-punk supergroup featuring former Birthday Party guitarist Mick Harvey on drums, ex-Magazine bassist Barry Adamson, and EinstÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼rzende Neubauten guitarist Blixa Bargeld. With the Bad Seeds, Cave continued to explore his obsessions with religion, death, love, America, and violence with a bizarre, sometimes self-consciously eclectic hybrid of blues, gospel, rock, and arty post-punk, although in a more subdued fashion than his work with the Birthday Party. Cave also allowed his literary aspirations to come to the forefront; the lyrics are narrative prose, heavy on literary allusions and myth-making, and take some inspiration from Leonard Cohen. Cave's gloomy lyrics, dark musical arrangements, and deep baritone voice recall the albums of Scott Walker, who also obsessed over death and love with a frightening passion. However, Cave brings a hefty amount of post-punk experimentalism to Walker's epic dark pop.\n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.As I Sat Sadly By Her Side\n02.And No More Shall We Part\n03.Hallelujah\n04.Love Letter\n05.Fifteen Feet Of Pure White Snow\n06.God Is In The House\n07.Oh My Lord\n08.Sweetheart Come\n09.The Sorrowful Wife\n10.We Came Along This Road\n11.Gates To The Garden\n12.Darker With The Day\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b515262f1e6da70cc92ac182eb760f92d92edfe5","amp;dn":"Nick+Cave+-+No+More+Shall+We+Part+2011+%5BRemaster%5D+CBR320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b515262f1e6da70cc92ac182eb760f92d92edfe5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,21,38,47,30,109,167,12,201,42,193,130,235,118,15,146,217,46,223,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
