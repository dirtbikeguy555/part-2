Brian Wilson reached a new level in terms of composition, production and arrangement. The landmark recording was ranked as one of the greatest albums of all time by NME, Rolling Stone, Vibe Magazine, The Times, Q and Mojo. The band produced their psychedelic sound blending together their stunning vocal harmonies with vivid orchestration. Included were the classics, Ã¢â‚¬Å“WouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t It Be Nice,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“God Only Knows,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Caroline, NoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sloop John B.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ This quintessential recording is now available as a pristine hi-res download, a must own!\n\nWhat music icons had to say about Pet Sounds:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“It was Pet Sounds that blew me out of the water. I love the album so much. I've just bought my kids each a copy of it for their education in life ... I figure no one is educated musically 'til they've heard that album ... I love the orchestra, the arrangements ... it may be going overboard to say it's the classic of the century ... but to me, it certainly is a total, classic record that is unbeatable in many ways ... I've often played Pet Sounds and cried. I played it to John [Lennon] so much that it would be difficult for him to escape the influence ... it was the record of the time. The thing that really made me sit up and take notice was the bass lines ... and also, putting melodies in the bass line. That I think was probably the big influence that set me thinking when we recorded Pepper, it set me off on a period I had then for a couple of years of nearly always writing quite melodic bass lines. &quot;God Only Knows&quot; is a big favourite of mine ... very emotional, always a bit of a choker for me, that one. On &quot;You Still Believe in Me&quot;, I love that melody - that kills me ... that's my favourite, I think ... it's so beautiful right at the end ... comes surging back in these multi-coloured harmonies ... sends shivers up my spine.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ - Paul McCartney\n\n &quot;All of us, Ginger Baker, Jack Bruce and I consider Pet Sounds to be one of the greatest pop LPs to ever be released.&quot; - Eric Clapton\n\n &quot;For me to say that I was enthralled would be an understatement. I had never heard such magical sounds, so amazingly recorded. It undoubtedly changed the way that I, and countless others, approached recording. It is a timeless and amazing recording of incredible genius and beauty.&quot; - Elton John\n\n &quot;I think I would put him up there with any composer - especially Pet Sounds. I don't think there is anything better than that, necessarily. I don't think you'd be out of line comparing him to Beethoven - to any composer.&quot; - Tom Petty\n\n\n #2 on Rolling Stone's &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time.&quot;\n\n &quot;...Brian Wilson's evolutionary compositional masterpiece....This trenchant cycle of love songs has the emotional impact of a shatteringly evocative novel...&quot; - Rolling Stone\n\n A+ - &quot;...a seamless masterwork that rewards deep, repeated listening....a wonderful collection of songs...&quot; - Entertainment Weekly\n\n Included in Vibe's &quot;100 Essential Albums of the 20th Century.&quot;\n\n - Ranked #1 in NME's list of the &quot;Greatest Albums of All Time.&quot;  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01.
