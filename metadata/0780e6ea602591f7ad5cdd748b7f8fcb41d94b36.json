Parlophone rush-released the album on 22 March 1963 in the United Kingdom to capitalise on the success of singles &quot;Please Please Me&quot; (No.1 on most lists but only No. 2 on Record Retailer) and &quot;Love Me Do&quot; (No.17).\n\nOf the album's fourteen songs, eight were written by LennonÃ¢â‚¬â€œMcCartney (originally credited &quot;McCartneyÃ¢â‚¬â€œLennon&quot;), early evidence of what Rolling Stone later called &quot;[their invention of] the idea of the self-contained rock band, writing their own hits and playing their own instruments&quot;.  In 2012, Please Please Me was voted 39th on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.\n\nPlease Please Me was recorded on a two-track BTR tape recording machine, with most of the instrumentation on one track and the vocals on the other, allowing for a better balance between the two on the final quarter-inch tape mix-down in mono. A stereo mix was made at the same time as the mono mix, with one track on the left channel and the other on the right, as well as an added layer of reverb to better blend the two tracks together. This was common practice for playback on stereo consoles.\n\nPlease Please Me was remastered and re-released on CD in stereo, along with all the other original UK studio albums, on 9 September 2009. The 2009 remasters replaced the 1987 remasters. A remastered mono CD was also available as part of the limited edition The Beatles in Mono box set.\n\n2009 STEREO REMASTER\n\n01. \t&quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot;   \tMcCartney \t2:54\n02. \t&quot;Misery&quot;   \tLennon and McCartney \t1:49\n03. \t&quot;Anna (Go to Him)&quot; (Arthur Alexander) \tLennon \t2:57\n04. \t&quot;Chains&quot; (Gerry Goffin, Carole King) \tGeorge Harrison \t2:26\n05. \t&quot;Boys&quot; (Luther Dixon, Wes Farrell) \tRingo Starr \t2:27\n06. \t&quot;Ask Me Why&quot;   \tLennon \t2:26\n07. \t&quot;Please Please Me&quot;   \tLennon and McCartney \t2:03\n08. \t&quot;Love Me Do&quot;   \tMcCartney and Lennon \t2:23\n09. \t&quot;P.S.
