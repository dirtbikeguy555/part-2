After touring in support of their previous album, The Sufferer &amp; the Witness, Rise Against began recording Appeal to Reason in January 2008 at the Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado. Recording and production were finished in June, and the album was released in North America on October 7, 2008. The album is the band's first release with guitarist Zach Blair. The album has been certified Gold by the RIAA and platinum by the CRIA.\n\nAppeal to Reason was Rise Against's highest charting album until the release of Endgame, debuting at number three on the Billboard 200 chart and selling 64,700 copies in its first week of release. It received generally favorable reviews from critics. The album produced three singles: &quot;Re-Education (Through Labor)&quot;, &quot;Audience of One&quot;, and &quot;Savior&quot;.\n\nAlthough commercially successful, Rise Against was greatly criticized by many long-term fans for producing an album that is a dramatic departure compared to Rise Against's previous, fast-paced, works. Despite this, the album has sold over 600,000 copies in the USA, with one of the songs going Platinum, and another going Gold; it is their most successful album to date.Track listing\n\nAll lyrics written by Tim McIlrath, all music composed by Tim McIlrath, Joe Principe, Brandon Barnes and Zach Blair.\nTracks \t\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Collapse (Post-Amerika)&quot;   \t3:19\n2. \t&quot;Long Forgotten Sons&quot;   \t4:01\n3. \t&quot;Re-Education (Through Labor)&quot;   \t3:42\n4. \t&quot;The Dirt Whispered&quot;   \t3:09\n5. \t&quot;Kotov Syndrome&quot;   \t3:05\n6. \t&quot;From Heads Unworthy&quot;   \t3:42\n7. \t&quot;The Strength to Go On&quot;   \t3:27\n8. \t&quot;Audience of One&quot;   \t4:05\n9. \t&quot;Entertainment&quot;   \t3:34\n10. \t&quot;Hero of War&quot;   \t4:13\n11. \t&quot;Savior&quot;   \t4:02\n12. \t&quot;Hairline Fracture&quot;   \t4:02\n13. \t&quot;Whereabouts Unknown&quot;   \t4:02\nTotal length:\n\t48:23 \t\n[show]International bonus track \t\n[show]Japanese (exclusive) bonus track \t\n[show]iTunes bonus tracks \t\nPersonnel\n\nRise Against\n\n    Tim McIlrath Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Lead vocals, rhythm guitar\n    Joe Principe Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bass guitar, backing vocals\n    Brandon Barnes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Drums\n    Zach Blair Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Lead guitar, backing vocals\n\nAdditional musicians\n\n    Matt Skiba (of Alkaline Trio) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Additional backing vocals on Hairline Fracture\n    Chad Price (of ALL) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Additional backing vocals\n\nArtwork\n\n    Todd Russell Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Art Direction, Design\n    Tim Marrs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Artwork, Illustrations\n    Tim Harmon Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Photography\nAnd yes your eyes saw its 256kbps seed it or leave it........","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f7242d9ef160dc8fe99fc70f246489a1205cd05","amp;dn":"Rise+Against-Appeal+To+Reason++mp3++256k+++ak6103","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f7242d9ef160dc8fe99fc70f246489a1205cd05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,114,66,217,239,22,13,200,254,153,252,112,242,70,72,154,18,5,205,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
