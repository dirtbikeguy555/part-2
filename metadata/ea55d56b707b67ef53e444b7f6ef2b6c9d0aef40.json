Alex was always reading headlines urging women not to delay motherhood and, at 38, she was worried she might be one of the 3.5 million people in the UK who struggle to conceive. She decided to find out more about the fertility issues so many people face, and this is her story. She investigates what pioneering science is doing to help people struggling to become pregnant, and she travels the world to see the cutting-edge techniques that could revolutionise fertility treatment in the future and give people new hope of having children.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/43/Fertility-and-Me-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2c/Fertility-and-Me-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c3/Fertility-and-Me-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cf/Fertility-and-Me-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3c/Fertility-and-Me-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e5/Fertility-and-Me-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e3/Fertility-and-Me-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6a/Fertility-and-Me-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/29/Fertility-and-Me-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~2109Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 43 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 692 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07wshm4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea55d56b707b67ef53e444b7f6ef2b6c9d0aef40","amp;dn":"BBC+Fertility+and+Me+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea55d56b707b67ef53e444b7f6ef2b6c9d0aef40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,85,213,107,112,123,103,239,83,228,68,183,246,239,43,108,157,10,239,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
