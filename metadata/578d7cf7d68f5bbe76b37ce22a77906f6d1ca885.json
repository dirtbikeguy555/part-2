Later on Markus felt that the band in which he was playing offered him very little inspiration and wanted to play something different. Markus was hugely inspired by folk music and also found himself fascinated about melodic death metal bands, like Amorphis and Dark Tranquility.\n\nThen one day Markus asked the band's drummer, Kimmo Miettinen, if he wanted to play heroic folk death metal with him. Kimmo agreed. Next Markus and Kimmo asked their friend Sauli Savolainen, if he wanted to come and play the bass. Fortunately he said yes. Now they had a band. Only trouble was that the band had no name at the time. One day Markus was visiting Sauli at his home, when he found a book. A Latin dictionary. Markus casually opened the book. And from the first randomly picked page he glanced at a word. Ensiferum. Markus found the word fascinating and when he read the translation he got really excited of this word.\n\nEnsiferum started it's training in January 1996 at the Pasila Youthcenter in Helsinki (the same place their earlier band Dark Reflections had their rehearsals). Markus begun writing songs in 1995, which he got finished later 1996. The songs were &quot;Knighthood&quot;, &quot;Old Man (VÃƒÂ¤inÃƒÂ¤mÃƒÂ¶inen)&quot; and &quot;Frost&quot;. Later in the same year Markus lured Jari MÃƒÂ¤enpÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤ (at the time a member of a band Immemorial and an experienced solo artist) to join his band as a singer and a second guitarist. Jari came aboard with some great skills and excellent musical ideas.\n\nThus the band was no longer a trio, but a quartet. Jari proved to be a skillfull lyricist and wrote the lyrics on &quot;Old Man&quot;. The two other songs required no new lyrics for Jari to write, because Markus had done the original lyrics on &quot;Knighthood&quot; and Sauli to &quot;Frost&quot;. So Jari just improved them. Ensiferum had their first concert at Pasila Youthcenter in December 1996. Ironically, they perfomed just one song, &quot;Old Man&quot;, which was the only song including finished lyrics.\n\n\n\nBand Members\n\nMarkus Toivonen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitars, backing vocals, clean vocals\nPetri Lindroos Ã¢â‚¬â€œ harsh vocals, guitars\nSami Hinkka Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass, clean vocals\nJanne Parviainen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\nEmmi Silvennoinen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keyboards, backing vocals\n\n\n\nDiscography\n\nEnsiferum (2001)\nIron (2004)\nVictory Songs (2007)\nFrom Afar (2009)\nUnsung Heroes (2012)\nOne Man Army (2015)\n\n\n\nOne Man Army (2015)\n\n\n\n1.
