They are known for their unusual amalgamation of metalcore and pop punk. The band currently consists of vocalist Jeremy McKinnon, rhythm guitarist Neil Westfall, bassist Joshua Woodard, percussion and drummer Alex Shelnutt and lead guitarist Kevin Skaff.\r\n\r\nSigning with Indianola Records for their first album, And Their Name Was Treason (2005), Scruggs was replaced by Shelnutt in 2006. Later that year the band recorded For Those Who Have Heart (2007) for Victory Records. They embarked on several tours of the UK and U.S. and played at several festivals, before recording and releasing Homesick (2009). \r\nWhile promoting Homesick on tour, Denney was replaced by Skaff. Soon after releasing their next album, What Separates Me from You (2010), the band went on a worldwide tour to promote it. \r\nBeginning in 2011, the band has been involved in a lawsuit with Victory Records over their recording contract. In October 2013 the band was given the right to self-release a new album until a final verdict is reached. They released their fifth album, Common Courtesy, the same month.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nTITLE: Common Courtesy\r\n    \r\nYEAR: 08.10.2013\r\n    \r\nCOUNTRY: USA\r\n    \r\nSTYLE: Post-Hardcore, Pop-Punk\r\n    \r\nDURATION:\t0:53:06\r\n    \r\nFORMAT: MP3\r\n    \r\nQUALITY: 320 kbps\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\n1.
