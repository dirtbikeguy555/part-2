It was the band's first full-length album and established their presence in the mid-1990s punk rock mainstream revival. The album's musical style blends elements of hardcore punk and ska, which contributed to the band's style being described as ska punk  or &quot;skacore.&quot; Music videos were filmed for the singles &quot;No Face&quot; and &quot;S.O.S.,&quot; with &quot;No Face&quot; reaching #31 on Billboard's Modern Rock charts.\n\n**********Bit Rate: 256kbps**********\n\n1. &quot;New Girl&quot;             2:03\n2. &quot;S.O.S.&quot;               2:25\n3. &quot;Break the Glass&quot;      3:08\n4. &quot;No Face&quot;              1:53\n5. &quot;Hey&quot;                  2:35\n6. &quot;Our Time&quot;             2:06\n7  &quot;Too Much&quot;             2:07\n8. &quot;Islands&quot;              2:04\n9. &quot;The Real You&quot;         2:01\n10.&quot;Face Values&quot;          1:21\n11.&quot;Punk Out&quot;             2:56\n12.&quot;Vans Song&quot;            2:37\n13.&quot;Insecurities&quot;         1:51\n14.&quot;Inside/Outside&quot;       1:48\n15.&quot;So Long&quot;              3:09 \nHidden Track:(Minor Threat Cover)\n&quot;I Don't Wanna Hear It&quot;   1:07\n\n**********PLEASE SEED**********","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf2915e2b7a01253d55990425b2e124ea66566ee","amp;dn":"The+Suicide+Machines+-+Destruction+By+Definition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf2915e2b7a01253d55990425b2e124ea66566ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,41,21,226,183,160,18,83,213,89,144,66,91,46,18,78,166,101,102,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
