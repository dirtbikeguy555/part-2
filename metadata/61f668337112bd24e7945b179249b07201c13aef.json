It stands in a group with Bruce Lee's Enter the Dragon, Jackie Chan's Drunken Master II\n\nChoreographed by the legendary Yuen Wo-Ping, this is Jet Li at his best (and that's saying a lot, folks). Eschewing the aerial wire stunts, Li relies on skill, speed and agility, and is more than up to the task. These fights - and there are a lot of them - are stunning. But the real wonder is that there's a real movie here underneath all the stuntwork. Interesting characters, an intriguing plot, and conflict that goes deeper than &quot;you killed my master&quot;; there's even some political comment. This is a thinly-veiled remake of Bruce Lee's &quot;Fist of Fury&quot; (or &quot;The Chinese Connection&quot; in the US, for some bizarre reason), but the story's been widened and given more depth. There's less Japanese-bashing, with more of an attempt to pin blame on individuals instead of nationalities.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://workittothebone.blogspot.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://workittothebone.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61f668337112bd24e7945b179249b07201c13aef","amp;dn":"Jet+Li+-+Fist+Of+Legend+%5BENG+DUB%5D%28DivX%29-AVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61f668337112bd24e7945b179249b07201c13aef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,246,104,51,113,18,189,36,231,148,91,23,146,73,176,114,1,193,58,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
