The show follows the life of protagonist Michael Westen (Jeffrey Donovan), a covert operative who has been &quot;burned&quot; (identified as an unreliable or dangerous agent) and tries to find out why. With his assets frozen, he is unable to leave Miami and forced to live off any small investigative jobs he can find, with the help of his girlfriend Fiona Glenanne (Gabrielle Anwar) and his old military friend Sam Axe (Bruce Campbell), who briefly informed on him to the FBI. His return to Miami also reunites him with his mother Madeline Westen (Sharon Gless), who becomes an increasingly important part of Michael's life even as he tries to hide his activities from her. Underpinning the episodic stories of Michael's investigative jobs is the running subplot exploring Michael's efforts to find out who burned him, and to get his job and reputation back.\n\n\n\nSome files are of slightly different quality and a few have hardcoded english subs that can be disabled in VLC or WD TV Media Player.
