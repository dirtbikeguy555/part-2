As the Velvet Underground's main songwriter, Reed wrote about subjects of personal experience that rarely had been examined so openly in rock and roll, including a variety of sexual topics and drug culture. \n\n\n\nAs a guitarist, he was a pioneer of many guitar effects including distortion, high volume feedback, and nonstandard tunings.\n\nReed began a solo career in 1971. He had a hit the following year with &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot;, although for more than a decade he evaded the mainstream commercial success its chart status offered him. \n\n\n\nReed's work as a solo artist has frustrated critics wishing for a return of The Velvet Underground. The most notable example is 1975's infamous double LP of recorded feedback loops, Metal Machine Music, upon which Reed later commented: &quot;No one is supposed to be able to do a thing like that and survive.&quot; \n\n\nBy the late 1980s, however, he had garnered recognition by the music community as an elder statesman of rock. Since 2008, he has been married to the musician, multi-media and performance artist Laurie Anderson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n\n\n01. Wild Child\n02. Walk On The Wild Side\n03. Vicious\n04.
