To start out, we'll look at the core workflow for creating and executing scripts in the Unity Editor. \n\nThen we'll learn about the core fundamentals that are used when scripting in Unity such as creating and manipulating variables, understanding the different types of operators, and how we can create instructions for our game objects using functions. We'll also jump into creating logic with conditional statements, loops, and basic arrays. \n\nFinally, we'll take what we've learned and apply it to creating a simple physics based rolling ball game.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dd08d23a84fed4de0ca7297a2906b2407a7066e","amp;dn":"Digital-Tutors+-+Introduction+to+C%23+in+Unity","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dd08d23a84fed4de0ca7297a2906b2407a7066e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,208,141,35,168,79,237,77,224,202,114,151,162,144,107,36,7,167,6,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
