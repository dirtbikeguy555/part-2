In addition, she revived the singer/songwriter traditions of the '70s while re-establishing the piano as a rock &amp; roll instrument. With her 1992 album Little Earthquakes, Amos built a dedicated following that expanded with her second album, Under the Pink, before giving way to a decade-spanning legacy. \n\n\nGenre................: Pop\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2012\nQuality..............: mp3 (CBR 320) Insane\n\n\nTracks:\n\n01.America\n02.Trouble's Lament\n03.Wild Way\n04.Wedding Day\n05.Weatherman\n06.16 Shades Of Blue\n07.Maids Of Elfen-Mere\n08.Promise\n09.Giant's Rolling Pin\n10.Selkie\n11.Unrepentant Geraldines\n12.Oysters\n13.Rose Dover\n14.Invisible Boy\n\n\n\n\nSupport The Artists.\n Buy it if you like it!\n\n Thanks for Seeding\nCheers...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dace1d7b1c1d5bd90ae41aa64544c6455fbcf7d","amp;dn":"Tori+Amos+-+Unrepentant+Geraldines+%282014%29+%7B320%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dace1d7b1c1d5bd90ae41aa64544c6455fbcf7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,172,225,215,177,193,213,189,144,174,65,170,100,84,76,100,85,251,207,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
