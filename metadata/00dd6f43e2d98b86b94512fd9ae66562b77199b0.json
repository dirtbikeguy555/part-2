But no one will tell him. Itâ€™s a tiny place hidden in a thousand square miles of wheat fields, with a railroad stop, and sullen and watchful people, and a worried woman named Michelle Chang, who mistakes him for someone else: her missing partner in a private investigation she thinks must have started small and then turned lethal.\r\nReacher has no particular place to go, and all the time in the world to get there, and thereâ€™s something about Chang . . . so he teams up with her and starts to ask around. He thinks: How bad can this thing be? But before long heâ€™s plunged into a desperate race through LA, Chicago, Phoenix, and San Francisco, and through the hidden parts of the internet, up against thugs and assassins every step of the wayâ€”right back to where he started, in Motherâ€™s Rest, where he must confront the worst nightmare he could imagine.\r\n\r\nWalking away would have been easier. But as always, Reacherâ€™s rule is: If you want me to stop, youâ€™re going to have to make me.\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Dick Hill\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00dd6f43e2d98b86b94512fd9ae66562b77199b0","amp;dn":"Lee+Child+-+Make+Me+%28Jack+Reacher+%2320%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00dd6f43e2d98b86b94512fd9ae66562b77199b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,221,111,67,226,217,139,134,185,69,18,253,154,230,101,98,183,113,153,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
