You will also want to\nallow setup to download updates during upgrade process. You use the key\nappropriate to the index you wish to install in the txt file I provided.\nThen, after setup, you change your key to whatever you wish and activate.\n\n**Installation instructions**:\nInstall from boot or delete the ei.cfg from the sources directory and run\nthe setup.exe to upgrade. If you upgrade, you'll need the keys provided in\nthe Win81-pkeys.txt I provide. If you don't have a legit retail key or\nlegit Volume MAK for Enterprise/Pro, I suggest using the gVLK in the txt.\n\nTo Activate using KMS, download the MTK 2.5.3 using the magnet link in the\ntorrent directory, run MTK, and select the EZ-Activator option. If you ever\nexperience a problem with AutoKMS activation, because of an A/V program,\nswitch to tap-adapter in the settings. It's more friendly with AV programs\nthan the secohook method.\n\nThere is also an OEM branding tool that you can use in conjunction with the\nOEM's folder from the Multi-Branding OEM project on MDL. If you pick that\nup and put it next to the &quot;OEM's&quot; folder and run it, you can apply all the\ngraphics to desktop background and system info and such. Remember to thank\nAlphawaves on that thread if you use that. It's pretty nifty. I use it myself.\n\nCredits:\nAlphawaves, The_Guardian, searchengine, and many others - Multi-Branding tool\nCODYQX4 - MS Toolkit 2.5.3\nmurphy78 - Testing, ISO design, Integration, Diskpart/Apply script\n\nEnjoy,\nmurphy78-MDL/KAT/TPB :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50ab1ada22b187ddf01aa1fdc871d83ecef1a0c9","amp;dn":"Windows+8.1+8in1+x64+en-US+Mar2015+murphy78","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50ab1ada22b187ddf01aa1fdc871d83ecef1a0c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,171,26,218,34,177,135,221,240,26,161,253,200,113,216,62,206,241,160,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
