His destination: a sturdy stone building a short bus ride from Washington D.C., the headquarters of his old unit, the 110th MP. It was the closest thing to a home he ever had.\n\nWhy? He wants to meet the new commanding officer, Major Susan Turner. He liked her voice on the phone. But the officer sitting behind his old desk isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a woman. Is Susan Turner dead? In Afghanistan? Or in a car wreck?\n\nWhat Reacher doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t expect to hear is that Turner has just been fired from her command. Nor that he himself is in big trouble, accused of a sixteen-year-old homicide. And he certainly doesn't expect to hear these words: Ã¢â‚¬ËœYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re back in the army, Major. And your ass is mine.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢\n\nWill he be sorry he went back? Or Ã¢â‚¬â€œ will someone else?\n\nepub,mobi and txt.
