This exploration drags Jeffery into a sordid, sinister underworld, a descent marked by the introduction of Isabella RosselliniÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s beguiling nightclub singer Dorothy Vallens.\n\nBeaumont and Vallens embark upon an initially voyeuristic, and at times almost disturbing, relationship, which does not bode well with Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper), the resident sociopathic gang leader. Intrigued by the hold Booth appears to have over Dorothy, Jeffery cannot help but investigate further, finding himself sucked further into this criminal underworld.\n\nThe relationship between the two also begins to impede the development of JefferyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s budding romance with Sandy. Dern delivers an understated performance, so much so that at points she runs the risk of fading into insignificance.\n\nThe film is worth seeing for Dennis HopperÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s performance alone, which is in equal parts hilarious and disconcerting. Strangely reminiscent of both Twin Peaks and 1950s noir, the film teeters between surreal and enthralling, at times verging on the disturbing, all factors that have endeared it to viewers and ensured its cult status. \n\nIn addition to Blue Velvet's various &quot;all time greatest films&quot; rankings, the American Film Institute has awarded the film three honors in its lists: one on 100 Years... 100 Thrills in 2001, selecting cinema's most thrilling moments and ranked the film's villain Frank Booth, as one of the 50 greatest villains in 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains in 2003. In June 2008, the AFI revealed its &quot;Ten top Ten&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the best ten films in ten &quot;classic&quot; American film genresÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. Blue Velvet was acknowledged as the eighth best film in the mystery genre. Premiere magazine listed Frank Booth, played by Dennis Hopper, as #54 on its list of The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time, calling him &quot;the most monstrously funny creations in cinema history&quot;. The film was ranked #84 on Bravo Television's four-hour program 100 Scariest Movie Moments (2004). It is frequently sampled musically and an array of bands and solo artists have taken their names and inspiration from the film.\n\nMedia Info:\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : J:\\Seeding\\Blue Velvet (1986)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢]\\Blue Velvet (1986)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢].avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFormat profile                   : OpenDML\nFile size                        : 1.66 GiB\nDuration                         : 2h 0mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 971 Kbps\nWriting application              : Lavf51.12.1\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : DX50\nCodec ID/Hint                    : DivX 5\nDuration                         : 2h 0mn\nBit rate                         : 1 638 Kbps\nWidth                            : 852 pixels\nHeight                           : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.167\nStream size                      : 1.38 GiB (83%)\nWriting library                  : Lavc51.40.4\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 49mn 3s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nStream size                      : 112 MiB (7%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 64 ms (1.54 video frames)\nWriting library                  : LAME3.97\n\nFile Scan:\nMalwarebytes' Anti-Malware 1.46\nwww.malwarebytes.org\n\nDatabase version: 5173\n\nWindows 5.1.2600 Service Pack 3\nInternet Explorer 8.0.6001.18702\n\n11/23/2010 1:26:04 AM\nmbam-log-2010-11-23 (01-26-04).txt\n\nScan type: Quick scan\nObjects scanned: 6\nTime elapsed: 8 second(s)\n\nMemory Processes Infected: 0\nMemory Modules Infected: 0\nRegistry Keys Infected: 0\nRegistry Values Infected: 0\nRegistry Data Items Infected: 0\nFolders Infected: 0\nFiles Infected: 0\n\nMemory Processes Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nMemory Modules Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Keys Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Values Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Data Items Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFolders Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFiles Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nWhen using TPB please read these important notes:\n  \n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of \n    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust\n    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. \n    \n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause\n    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow \n    apps &amp; malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is\n    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull &amp; Crossbones icon are trusted.\n\n06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously\n    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and\n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.\n\n10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result\n    in getting banned from TPB!\n\nRequests?
