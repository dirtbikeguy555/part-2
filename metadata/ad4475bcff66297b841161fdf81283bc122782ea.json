He also weighed 300 pounds, despite the fact that he was doing what doctors recommended: eating 1,800 calories a day and working out 90 minutes a day, six times a week.\n\nWhen his excess fat started causing brain fog and food cravings sapped his energy and willpower, Asprey turned to the same hacking techniques that made his fortune to &quot;hack&quot; his own biology, investing more than $300,000 and 15 years to uncover what was hindering his energy, performance, appearance, and happiness. From private brain EEG facilities to remote monasteries in Tibet, through radioactive brain scans, blood chemistry work, nervous system testing, and more, he explored traditional and alternative technologies to reach his physical and mental prime. The result? The Bulletproof Diet, an anti-inflammatory program for hunger-free, rapid weight loss and peak performance.\n\nThe Bulletproof Diet will challengeÃ¢â‚¬â€and changeÃ¢â‚¬â€the way you think about weight loss and wellness. You will skip breakfast, stop counting calories, eat high levels of healthy saturated fat, work out and sleep less, and add smart supplements.\nIn doing so, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll gain energy, build lean muscle, and watch the pounds melt off. By ditching traditional &quot;diet&quot; thinking, Asprey went from being overweight and sick in his twenties to maintaining a 100-pound weight loss, increasing his IQ, and feeling better than ever in his forties. The Bulletproof Diet is your blueprint to a better life","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad4475bcff66297b841161fdf81283bc122782ea","amp;dn":"The+Bulletproof+Diet+-+Dave+Asprey.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad4475bcff66297b841161fdf81283bc122782ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,68,117,188,255,102,41,123,132,17,97,253,248,18,131,188,18,39,130,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
