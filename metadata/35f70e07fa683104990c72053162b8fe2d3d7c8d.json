Launched by Dr. Dre, Eminem has stamped his distinctive style all over the rap genre, winning nine Grammies and an Oscar for his innovative beats and flow, and of course his controversial lyrics have kept him in the spotlight one way or the other.\n\nThis is his fifth album, the first Greatest Hits compilation, and includes three new songs as well as most of his hit singles from Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Slim Shady LPÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Marshall Mathers LPÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Eminem ShowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Ã¢â‚¬Å“EncoreÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the Ã¢â‚¬Å“8 MileÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ soundtrack. It also includes the live version of Ã¢â‚¬Å“StanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ performed at the 2001 GrammyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s by Eminem and Elton John. The one omission that comes to mind is Ã¢â‚¬Å“SupermanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and also maybe Ã¢â‚¬Å“EncoreÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, but there are enough hits to make most people very happy.\n\nThe new tracks are Ã¢â‚¬Å“FACKÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a funny track that more than earns a PA warning, the infectious Ã¢â‚¬Å“Shake ThatÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (featuring Nate Dogg), and one of the best new songs around - Ã¢â‚¬Å“When IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m GoneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Lyrics from Ã¢â‚¬Å“When IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m GoneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ strongly hint that Eminem may be taking a break to spend more time with his daughter and niece, and he also may be working on expanding his production portfolio.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“What happens when you become the main source of her pain\n\n&quot;Daddy look what I made&quot;\n\nDad's got to go catch a plane\n\n&quot;Daddy, where's Mommy, I can't find Mommy where is she?&quot;\n\nI don't know, go play, Hailey baby, your daddy's busyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThis album represents the very best of Eminem, plus a couple of excellent new tracks. Highly recommended.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35f70e07fa683104990c72053162b8fe2d3d7c8d","amp;dn":"Eminem+-+The+Hits+%5BFLAC%2BMP3%5D+Curtain+Call+-+Explicit+Lyrics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35f70e07fa683104990c72053162b8fe2d3d7c8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,247,14,7,250,104,49,4,153,12,114,5,49,98,184,254,45,61,124,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
