Was he a destroyer or the greatest of liberators? Why did he have to fight his battle, not against his enemies, but against those who needed him most, and his hardest battle against the woman he loved? What is the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s motorÃ¢â‚¬â€and the motive power of every man? You will know the answer to these questions when you discover the reason behind the baffling events that play havoc with the lives of the characters in this story. Tremendous in its scope, this novel presents an astounding panorama of human lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€from the productive genius who becomes a worthless playboyÃ¢â‚¬â€to the great steel industrialist who does not know that he is working for his own destructionÃ¢â‚¬â€to the philosopher who becomes a pirateÃ¢â‚¬â€to the composer who gives up his career on the night of his triumphÃ¢â‚¬â€to the woman who runs a transcontinental railroadÃ¢â‚¬â€to the lowest track worker in her Terminal tunnels.You must be prepared, when you read this novel, to check every premise at the root of your convictions. This is a mystery story, not about the murderÃ¢â‚¬â€and rebirthÃ¢â‚¬â€of manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spirit. It is a philosophical revolution, told in the form of an action thriller of violent events, a ruthlessly brilliant plot structure and an irresistible suspense. Do you say this is impossible? Well, that is the first of your premises to check.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26e4efb44376d422e981b907287f7ef2e1a6471d","amp;dn":"Atlas+Shrugged%3A+%28Centennial+Edition%29+by+Ayn+Rand+%28PDF%2C+Mobi%2C+Epu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26e4efb44376d422e981b907287f7ef2e1a6471d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,228,239,180,67,118,212,34,233,129,185,7,40,127,126,242,225,166,71,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
