Instead of the traditional pedagogic way, the author arranges the subjects and formalisms in a logical-sequential way, i.e. all the formulas are derived from the formulas before them. The formalisms are also kept self-contained. Most of the required mathematical tools are also given in the appendices.\r\n\r\nAlthough this book covers all the disciplines of fundamental physics, the book is concise and can be treated as an integrated entity. This is consistent with the aphorism that simplicity is beauty, unification is beauty, and thus physics is beauty. The book may be used as an advanced textbook by graduate students. It is also suitable for physicists who wish to have an overview of fundamental physics.\r\n\r\nReadership: This is an advanced graduate or postgraduate level book","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97abcf867effdd83b31f746f079fb542e6f503fa","amp;dn":"Principles+of+Physics%3A+From+Quantum+Field+Theory+to+Classical+Me","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97abcf867effdd83b31f746f079fb542e6f503fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,171,207,134,126,255,221,131,179,31,116,111,7,159,181,66,230,245,3,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
