The story reveals the origins of Scoresby's friendship with Ioric Byrnison as well as Scoresby's aeronautical career.\n\nAfter winning his hot-air balloon in a poker game, Scoresby finds himself floating north. On the Arctic island of Novy Odense, Scoresby and his dÃƒÂ¦mon Hester become involved in a deadly plot involving an oil magnate, a corrupt mayoral candidate, and a hired killer who is Lee's longtime nemesis from the Dakota Country. Forming an alliance with one of the island's reviled armored bears, Scoresby fights to break up the conspiracy.\n\nThis clothbound volume features the illustrations of John Lawrence, a removable board game on the inside back cover, and the story that offers a glimpse into the origins of the friendship of two beloved characters in the His Dark Materials trilogy.\n\nThe Golden Compass (His Dark Materials #1) by Philip Pullman (April 16th 1996)\n\nHere lives an orphaned ward named Lyra Belacqua, whose carefree life among the scholars at Oxford's Jordan College is shattered by the arrival of two powerful visitors. First, her fearsome uncle, Lord Asriel, appears with evidence of mystery and danger in the far North, including photographs of a mysterious celestial phenomenon called Dust and the dim outline of a city suspended in the Aurora Borealis that he suspects is part of an alternate universe. He leaves Lyra in the care of Mrs. Coulter, an enigmatic scholar and explorer who offers to give Lyra the attention her uncle has long refused her. In this multilayered narrative, however, nothing is as it seems. Lyra sets out for the top of the world in search of her kidnapped playmate, Roger, bearing a rare truth-telling instrument, the compass of the title. All around her children are disappearingÃ¢â‚¬â€victims of so-called &quot;Gobblers&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€and being used as subjects in terrible experiments that separate humans from their daemons, creatures that reflect each person's inner being. And somehow, both Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter are involved.\n\nThe Subtle Knife (His Dark Materials #2) by Philip Pullman (July 22nd 1997)\n\nHere is the highly anticipated second installment of Philip Pullman's epic fantasy trilogy, begun with the critically acclaimed The Golden Compass. Lyra and Will, her newfound friend, tumble separately into the strange tropical otherworld of CittÃƒÂ gazze, &quot;the city of magpies,&quot; where adults are curiously absent and children run wild. Here their lives become inextricably entwined when Lyra's alethiometer gives her a simple command: find Will's father. Their search is plagued with obstacles--some familiar and some horribly new and unfathomable--but it eventually brings them closer to Will's father and to the Subtle Knife, a deadly, magical, ancient tool that cuts windows between worlds. Through it all, Will and Lyra find themselves hurtling toward the center of a fierce battle against a force so awesome that leagues of mortals, witches, beasts, and spirits from every world are uniting in fear and anger against it. This breathtaking sequel will leave readers eager for the third and final volume of His Dark Materials.\n\nThe Amber Spyglass (His Dark Materials #3) by Philip Pullman (September 9th 2003)\n\nIn the astonishing finale to the His Dark Materials trilogy, Lyra and Will are in unspeakable danger. With help from Iorek Byrnison the armored bear and two tiny Gallivespian spies, they must journey to a dank and gray-lit world where no living soul has ever gone. All the while, Dr. Mary Malone builds a magnificent Amber Spyglass. An assassin hunts her down, and Lord Asriel, with a troop of shining angels, fights his mighty rebellion, in a battle of strange alliesÃ¢â‚¬â€and shocking sacrifice.\n\nAs war rages and Dust drains from the sky, the fate of the livingÃ¢â‚¬â€and the deadÃ¢â‚¬â€finally comes to depend on two children and the simple truth of one simple story.\n\nLyra's Oxford (His Dark Materials #3.5) by Philip Pullman (October 28th 2003)\n\nLyra's Oxford begins with Lyra and Pantalaimon spotting a witch's daemon. Lyra shelters the daemon from the pursuit of a frenzied pack of birds, and then attempts to help by guiding the daemon to the home of an alchemist living in a part of Oxford known as Jericho. The journey through Oxford reveals more dangers than Lyra had anticipated.\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7cb358830f6f8aad99c891bbca0c54be6043717","amp;dn":"His+Dark+Materials+Series+%28.5-3.5%29+by+Philip+Pullman+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7cb358830f6f8aad99c891bbca0c54be6043717","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,203,53,136,48,246,248,170,217,156,137,27,188,160,197,75,230,4,55,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
