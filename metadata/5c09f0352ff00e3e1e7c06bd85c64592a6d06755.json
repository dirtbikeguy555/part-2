AD 539-594) is a fascinating exploration of the events that shaped sixth-century France. This volume contains all ten books from the work, the last seven of which provide an in-depth description of Gregory's own era, in which he played an important role as Bishop of Tours.\r\n\r\nWith skill and eloquence, Gregory brings the age vividly to life, as he relates the exploits of missionaries, martyrs, kings and queens - including the quarrelling sons of Lothar I, and the ruthless Queen Fredegund, third wife of Chilperic. Portraying an age of staggering cruelty and rapid change, this is a powerful depiction of the turbulent progression of faith at a time of political and social chaos","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c09f0352ff00e3e1e7c06bd85c64592a6d06755","amp;dn":"The+History+of+the+Franks+by+Gregory+of+Tours+%28Penguin+Classics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c09f0352ff00e3e1e7c06bd85c64592a6d06755","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,9,240,53,47,240,14,62,30,124,6,189,133,198,69,146,166,208,103,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
