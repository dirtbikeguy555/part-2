Based on nine years of research, buttressed by rigorous analysis and infused with engaging stories, Collins and his colleague, Morten Hansen, enumerate the principles for building a truly great enterprise in unpredictable, tumultuous, and fast-moving times.\n\nThe new study\nGreat by Choice distinguishes itself from CollinsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s prior work by its focus not just on performance, but also on the type of unstable environments faced by leaders today.\n\nWith a team of more than twenty researchers, Collins and Hansen studied companies that rose to greatnessÃ¢â‚¬â€beating their industry indexes by a minimum of ten times over fifteen yearsÃ¢â‚¬â€in environments characterized by big forces and rapid shifts that leaders could not predict or control. The research team then contrasted these Ã¢â‚¬Å“10X companiesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to achieve greatness in similarly extreme environments.\n\nThe new findings\nThe study results were full of provocative surprises. Such as:\n\nThe best leaders were not more risk taking, more visionary, and more creative than the comparisons; they were more disciplined, more empirical, and more paranoid.\nInnovation by itself turns out not to be the trump card in a chaotic and uncertain world; more important is the ability to scale innovation, to blend creativity with discipline.\nFollowing the belief that leading in a Ã¢â‚¬Å“fast worldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ always requires Ã¢â‚¬Å“fast decisionsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“fast actionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a good way to get killed.\nThe great companies changed less in reaction to a radically changing world than the comparison companies.\nThe authors challenge conventional wisdom with thought-provoking, sticky, and supremely practical concepts. They include: 10Xers; the 20 Mile March; Fire Bullets, Then Cannonballs; Leading above the Death Line; Zoom Out, Then Zoom In; and the SMaC Recipe.\n\nFinally, in the last chapter, Collins and Hansen present their most provocative and original analysis: defining, quantifying, and studying the role of luck. The great companies and the leaders who built them were not luckier than the comparisons, but they did get a higher Return on Luck.\n\nThis book is classic Collins: contrarian, data-driven, and uplifting. He and Hansen show convincingly that, even in a chaotic and uncertain world, greatness happens by choice, not chance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da2366453b143ef4881dcb8dcae1085e0151d443","amp;dn":"Great+By+Choice+-+Jim+Collins+%5BQwerty80%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da2366453b143ef4881dcb8dcae1085e0151d443","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,35,102,69,59,20,62,244,136,29,203,141,202,225,8,94,1,81,212,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
