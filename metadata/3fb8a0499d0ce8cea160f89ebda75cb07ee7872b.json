The game aims to capture the attention of the same core group of players as its spiritual precursor, &quot;I Wanna be the Boshy &quot;, including the hardcore-platformer lovers and the speedrunning community, all while appealing to a broader audience through a variety of difficulty levels and modifiers .\r\n\r\n&quot;Wings of Vi&quot; is an interesting mix between challenge, story and with room for both exploring and tricky platforming","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fb8a0499d0ce8cea160f89ebda75cb07ee7872b","amp;dn":"Wings+of+Vi+v1.09","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fb8a0499d0ce8cea160f89ebda75cb07ee7872b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,184,160,73,157,12,232,206,161,96,248,158,189,167,92,176,126,231,135,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
