Moving from lean, powerful R&amp;B to stylish, sophisticated soul to finally arrive at an intensely political and personal form of artistic self-expression, his work not only redefined soul music as a creative force but also expanded its impact as an agent for social change.\n\nSinger Tammi Terrell joined forces with the immortal Marvin Gaye to create some of the greatest love songs ever to emerge from the Motown hit factory; sadly, their series of classic duets -- &quot;Ain't No Mountain High Enough,&quot; &quot;Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing,&quot; and &quot;You're All I Need to Get By&quot; among them -- came to an abrupt and tragic halt with her premature death. Terrell was born Thomasina Montgomery in Philadelphia on April 29, 1945; after winning a number of local talent contests, by the age of 13 she was regularly opening club dates for acts including Gary &quot;U.S.&quot; Bonds and Patti LaBelle &amp; the Bluebelles. In 1961, she was discovered by producer Luther Dixon and signed to Scepter. Credited as Tammy Montgomery, she made her debut with the single &quot;If You See Bill,&quot; followed early the next year by &quot;The Voice of Experience.&quot; After James Brown caught Terrell's live act, she was signed to his Try Me label, issuing &quot;I Cried&quot; in 1963 and also touring with his live revue. &quot;If I Would Marry You&quot; appeared on Checker a year later, during which time she also studied pre-med at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tSoul and R&amp;B\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Your Precious Love\n02.Ain't No Mountain High Enough\n03.You're All I Need To Get By\n04.Ain't Nothing Like The Real Thing\n05.Good Livin' Ain't Easy To Come By\n06.If This World Were Mine\n07.The Onion Song\n08.If I Could Build My Whole World Around You\n09.Keep On Lovin' Me Honey\n10.What You Gave Me\n11.You Ain't Livin' Till You're Lovin'\n12.Hold Me Oh My Darling\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8384ae55269c65b485701f800371dd8d24972c51","amp;dn":"Marvin+Gaye+%26+Tammi+Terrell-Greatest+Hits+%281998%29+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8384ae55269c65b485701f800371dd8d24972c51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,132,174,85,38,156,101,180,133,112,31,128,3,113,221,141,36,151,44,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
