The series begins with the 'Black Swordsman' arc, continuing through the 'Golden Age' arc. Though the manga storyline remains largely intact, many changes were made, with the modification or elimination of characters (one notable example being Puck), some of the series' most violent and brutal scenes, and material that would have extended the storyline beyond the planned run of the anime series. Themes of friendship and ambition are more developed and emphasized than those of causality and the supernatural, all of which were made with the approval of series creator Kentaro Miura.\n\n[TECHNICAL DETAILS]\n\nFile Container: MKV\nVideo Format: h.264/Mpeg4\nVideo Resolution: 1440x1080\n\nAudio Type: English Stereo, Japanese Stereo\nAudio Format: AAC\n\nSubtitle Language: English \nSubtitle Format: ASS &amp; SRT","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8adc698e582335cf940d0fcd1db755b46d3adc2","amp;dn":"Berserk+%5B1080p%5D+%5B10-bit%5D+%5BDUAL-AUDIO%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8adc698e582335cf940d0fcd1db755b46d3adc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,173,198,152,229,130,51,92,249,64,208,252,209,219,117,91,70,211,173,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
