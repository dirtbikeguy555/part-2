Up until a few years ago, she still envisioned her sexual experience â€œeventually reaching a terminus, like a monorail gliding to a stop at Epcot Center.â€ Like many people, she imagined herself disembarking, finding herself face-to-face with another human being, â€œand there we would remain in our permanent station in life: the future.â€\r\nBut, as many of us have found, things are more complicated than that. Love is rare and frequently unrecipricated. Sexual experience doesnâ€™t necessarily lead to a future of traditional monogamyâ€”and why should it? Have we given up too quickly on the alternatives?\r\nIn Future Sex, Witt explores Internet dating, Internet pornography, polyamory, and avant-garde sexual subcultures as sites of possibility. She observes these scenes from within, capturing them in all their strangeness, ridiculousness, and beauty. The result is an open-minded, honest account of the contemporary pursuit of connection and pleasure","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93e9a0f45834b03ff398d7447566ff509e35076a","amp;dn":"Future+Sex+-+Emily+Witt.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93e9a0f45834b03ff398d7447566ff509e35076a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,233,160,244,88,52,176,63,243,152,215,68,117,102,255,80,158,53,7,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
