The band makes extensive use of soaring 3-part vocal harmonies (which they refer to in their album liner notes as the &quot;oozin' aahs&quot;), guitar solos and intellectual lyrics that often contain political commentary. Their lyrics often relate to matters of social responsibility. The band's lineup has changed several times over its lifespan, with lead vocalist Greg Graffin being the only consistent member; the current lineup, however, features three out of four of the band's original members (Graffin, Brett Gurewitz and Jay Bentley).\n\nLeadsinger: Gregory Walter Graffin, Ph.D. (born November 6, 1964) is an American punk rock musician, college professor, and author. He is most recognized as the lead vocalist, songwriter, and only constant member of the noted Los Angeles band Bad Religion, which he co-founded in 1979. He also embarked on a solo career in 1997, when he released the album American Lesion. His follow-up album, Cold as the Clay was released nine years later. Graffin obtained his Ph.D. at Cornell University and has lectured courses in life sciences and paleontology at the University of California, Los Angeles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df9c3ed209802dbf3c3b0c5f6b6ff5191f4aa59b","amp;dn":"Bad+Religion-Stranger+Than+Fiction+1994+..320kbps+%28stPaddy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df9c3ed209802dbf3c3b0c5f6b6ff5191f4aa59b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,156,62,210,9,128,45,191,60,59,12,95,107,111,245,25,31,74,165,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
