A double album, an exclusive EP for Asia, a live DVD, an extensive world tour Ã¢â‚¬â€œ no time to rest and boom! Here we go again with yet another masterpiece called The Ride Majestic.\nMarking new bass player Markus Wibom's (ex-HEARTS ALIVE) addition to the band, Ã‚Â»The Ride MajesticÃ‚Â« picks up where they left off with their critically acclaimed double album Ã‚Â»The Living InfiniteÃ‚Â«. While musically exploring darker grounds than ever before the band also Ã¢â‚¬Å¾strayed away a bit from the &quot;regular song structures&quot; and have been a bit more spontaneous as well, giving in for the moment and not care to much of the consequences so to speak,Ã¢â‚¬Å“ as singer BjÃƒÂ¶rn Ã¢â‚¬Å¾SpeedÃ¢â‚¬Å“ Strid puts it. But fear not, those amazingly catchy choruses, melodies and powerful riff and drum attacks that are so connected with the SOILWORK universe are still very present Ã¢â‚¬â€œ just check out the opening title track and first single and you will agree!\nLyrically the band dug deep into the principle of life and death. Something SOILWORK tragically had to experience all the way through the production process of Ã‚Â»The Ride MajesticÃ‚Â« as Strid explains: Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Just about every member of the band had a death in the family while recording the album. On top of that, a good friend of ours in a very promising and young band called CHRONUS from Helsingborg, also passed away out of nowhere. 19 years old. Absolutely terrible. We came up with this title to remember what we've gone through together and make it a hymn to those we've lost and celebrate their lives. It's also a reminder that this life we're living is a majestic ride after all. Hopefully that ride will somehow continue once we pass away. The majestic ride is eternal. I think that happens when you lose somebody close - you want them to live on. This is our tribute.Ã¢â‚¬Å“\nGuest vocal appearances feature SONIC SYNDICATE's Nathan James Biggs on 'Father and Son, Watching The World Go Down' and Pascal Poulsen of ODIUM on 'The Phantom'.\nA European headlining tour will take place in November / December 2015","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1732eec9315d88c87a39010ab8224a00c7a316e4","amp;dn":"+SOILWORK+-+The+Ride+Majestic+%282015%29+%5BDeath+Metal%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1732eec9315d88c87a39010ab8224a00c7a316e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,50,238,201,49,93,136,200,122,57,1,10,184,34,74,0,199,163,22,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
