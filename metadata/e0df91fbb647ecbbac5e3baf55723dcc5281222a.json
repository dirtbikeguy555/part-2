It does not include any of the specials.\n\nMorse was played by John Thaw, and the faithful Detective Sergeant Lewis by Kevin Whately. The character of Lewis was transformed from the elderly Welshman and ex-boxer of the novels to a much younger Geordie police sergeant with a family, as a foil to MorseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cynical streak. Dexter makes a cameo appearance in all but three of the episodes. The series remains popular and is frequently repeated on ITV1 and ITV3 in Britain.\n\nJohn Thaw had a special appreciation of the fact that Morse was different from classic characters such as James Bond and Sherlock Holmes. Morse was brilliant but he wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t always right. He often arrested the wrong person or came to the wrong conclusion. As a result, unlike many classic sleuths, Morse does not always simply ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“bustÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ his culprit; ironic circumstances have the case end and the crime brought to him. Also, Morse was a romantic but had little success in love.\n\nMorse is a character whose talents and intelligence were being wasted in positions which fail to match his abilities. Several references are made to the fact that Morse would have been promoted above and beyond Chief Inspector at Thames Valley CID, but his cynicism and lack of ambition, coupled also to veiled hints that he may have made enemies in high places, frustrate his progression despite his Oxford connections.\n\nMorse is a highly credible detective and plausible human being. His penchant for drinking, his life filled with difficult personal relationships, and his negligence toward his health, however, make him a more tragic character than previous classic sleuths.\n\nPlease enjoy and...\n...seed, seed, seed...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0df91fbb647ecbbac5e3baf55723dcc5281222a","amp;dn":"Inspector+Morse+-+The+Collector%5C%27s+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0df91fbb647ecbbac5e3baf55723dcc5281222a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,223,145,251,182,71,236,187,172,94,59,175,85,114,61,204,82,129,34,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
