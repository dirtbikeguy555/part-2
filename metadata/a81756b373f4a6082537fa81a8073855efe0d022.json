According to Orwell, the book reflects events leading up to and during the Stalin era before World War II. Orwell, a democratic socialist, was a critic of Joseph Stalin and hostile to Moscow-directed Stalinism, especially after his experiences with the NKVD, and what he saw of the results of the influence of Communist policy (&quot;ceaseless arrests, censored newspapers, prowling hordes of armed police&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ &quot;Communism is now a counter-revolutionary force&quot;), during the Spanish Civil War. In a letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell described Animal Farm as his novel &quot;contre Stalin&quot;.\n\nThe original title was Animal Farm: A Fairy Story, but the subtitle was dropped by the US publishers for its 1946 publication and subsequently all but one of the translations during Orwell's lifetime omitted the addition. Other variations in the title include: A Satire and A Contemporary Satire.[3] Orwell suggested for the French translation the title Union des rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©publiques socialistes animales, recalling the French name of the Soviet Union, Union des rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©publiques socialistes soviÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tiques, and which abbreviates URSA, which is the Latin for &quot;bear&quot;, a symbol of Russia.\n\nTime magazine chose the book as one of the 100 best English-language novels (1923 to 2005); it also places at number 31 on the Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels. It won a Retrospective Hugo Award in 1996 and is also included in the Great Books of the Western World.\n\nThe novel addresses not only the corruption of the revolution by its leaders but also how wickedness, indifference, ignorance, greed and myopia destroy any possibility of a Utopia. While this novel portrays corrupt leadership as the flaw in revolution (and not the act of revolution itself), it also shows how potential ignorance and indifference to problems within a revolution could allow horrors to happen if a smooth transition to a people's government is not achieved.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a81756b373f4a6082537fa81a8073855efe0d022","amp;dn":"Animal+Farm+-+George+Orwell+++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a81756b373f4a6082537fa81a8073855efe0d022","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,23,86,179,115,244,166,8,37,55,250,129,168,7,56,85,239,224,208,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
