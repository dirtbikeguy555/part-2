The album starts out with &quot;Summer of '69,&quot; the appealing autobiographical song about the 10-year-old Adams learning to play his first guitar in Ontario, and includes &quot;(Everything I Do) I Do for You,&quot; the synth-laced ballad that wound up in the Guinness Book of World Records after topping the British singles charts for 16 weeks. With its over-the-top, gravelly vocals, So Far So Good reminds one of Rod Stewart's 1980s work when he was coasting on past achievements. Unfortunately, Adams has never had a period like Stewart's glory years in the '70s.\n\n\n1 Summer Of '69\n2 Straight From The Heart\n3 It's Only Love\n4 Can't Stop This Thing We Started\n5 Do I Have To Say The Words\n6 This Time\n7 Run To You\n8 Heaven\n9 Cuts Like A Knife\n10 (Everything I Do) I Do It For You\n11 Somebody\n12 Kids Wanna Rock\n13 Heat Of The Night\n14 Please Forgive Me\n\n\nArtiste: Bryan Adams\nFile Type: Mp3 Audio\nAudio Format: MPEG Layer-3\nRelease Date: November 9th, 1993\nRecord Label: A &amp; M\nGenre: World Music / Rock / Pop\nPlaying Time: 01HR 02MINS 42SECS\nBiltrate: 320kbps\nBit Depth: 16 bit\nChannels: 2 (Stereo)\nAudio Sample Rate: 44kHz\n\n\n***FRONT COVER***\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/aVADENh.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/aVADENh.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n***BACK COVER***\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/BmYEPbg.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/BmYEPbg.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21b03e9d84ec8169377896ea8b19d5df434be295","amp;dn":"Bryan+Adams.1993.SO+FAR+SO+GOOD%5BMp3%5D.320Kbps.-ROSTROMASCARADO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21b03e9d84ec8169377896ea8b19d5df434be295","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,176,62,157,132,236,129,105,55,120,150,234,139,25,213,223,67,75,226,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
