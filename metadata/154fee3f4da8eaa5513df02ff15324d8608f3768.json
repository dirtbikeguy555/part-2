(There's a foreboding proclamation from Pimp C during the intro that he and Bun B are &quot;back from the dead.&quot;) But from there, his surviving partner and production team let the music--and familiar themes of sex and other forms of indulgent relaxation--take center stage. Apart from inviting a revaluation of the late rapper's underrated soulfulness, 4 LIFE serves as a testament to UGK's trademark smoothness, which, on their final collaboration, evokes what the Ohio Players might sound like if they were updated for the hip-hop generation.\n\nAudio Mixer: Mike Dean (Z-ro's Producer) .Rolling Stone (p.86) - 3.5 stars out of 5 -- 'Da Game Been Good to Me' reminds us what rap lost with Pimp C's death: one of its most musical and melodic MCs, with a thick drawl and a knack for wildly elongating words...&quot;\nSpin (p.98) - &quot;UGK 4 LIFE is a fitting capper to this Texas duo's storied career -- nothing groundbreaking, just funky, rough-hewn, celebratory tracks.&quot;\nBlender (Magazine) - 4 stars out of 5 -- &quot;The languid beats are hazy with heat-distortion organs...the spirit is carefree....Pimp excelled at scowling, bawdy boasts, and he creates his own eulogy here...&quot;\nPitchfork (Website) - &quot;Bun-B's performance is a masterwork of nuance here, sounding doubled even when it's obvious he's not...&quot;\n\nMike Dean's Quote From p.86 Rolling Stone:\n\n&quot;Back from the dead!&quot; crows Pimp C in the opening moments of the sixth studio album by these Texas crackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“rap pioneers. It's an eerie moment ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Pimp C was found dead in an L.A. hotel in December 2007 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but thankfully, Pimp's surviving partner, Bun B, doesn't wallow in the macabre. Instead, we get UGK basics: songs about drugs, sex and flossing, flavored with thudding, noÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“nonsense beats. Cuts like the sulfurous &quot;Da Game Been Good to Me&quot; remind us what rap lost with Pimp C's death: one of its most musical and melodic MCs, with a thick drawl and a knack for wildly elongating words ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ stuffing seven or eight extra syllables into phrases like, well, &quot;back from the dead.&quot;\n\n\nTracks Featured:\n\n 1.
