DOCTOR&amp;#039;S ADVOCATE&amp;#039;s production credits include a long and eclectic list of super-producers such as DJ Khalil, Will.I.Am, Just Blaze, Kanye West, Scott Storch, and Hi-Tek, but not, oddly, Dre.\n\nThat might be the point. It&amp;#039;s a testament to Dre&amp;#039;s industry weight that he can dominate an LP without touching it. While his beats are conspicuously absent, Dre&amp;#039;s influence can be heard on every track. And on the rare occasions when Game isn&amp;#039;t directly talking to or about him, the Compton MC&amp;#039;s vocal tone, lyrical content, and delivery are paying Dre homage. At the same time, the Game&amp;#039;s Chronic-inspired lyrics and arsenal of clever punch-lines add up to an undeniable charisma all his own.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n1. lookin at you\n2. da shit\n3. it&amp;#039;s okay (one blood)\n4. compton\n5. remedy\n6. let&amp;#039;s ride\n7. too much\n8. wouldn&amp;#039;t get far\n9. scream on em\n10. one night\n11. doctor&amp;#039;s advocate\n12. ol&amp;#039; english\n13. california vacation\n14. bang\n15. around the world\n16. why you hate the game","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17b9b7a797474e95aca3d922c9b65c5b8d1f2eba","amp;dn":"The_Game-Doctors_Advocate-KRG-gadge007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17b9b7a797474e95aca3d922c9b65c5b8d1f2eba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,185,183,167,151,71,78,149,172,163,217,34,201,182,92,91,141,31,46,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
