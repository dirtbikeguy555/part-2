Hollywood's classical film noir period is generally regarded as extending from the early 1940s to the late 1950s. Film noir of this era is associated with a low-key black-and-white visual style that has roots in German Expressionist cinematography. Many of the prototypical stories and much of the attitude of classic noir derive from the hardboiled school of crime fiction that emerged in the United States during the Great Depression.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58f395ce8c85e7d6c7672a90922f00a6bbbede02","amp;dn":"Film+Noir+Movie+Posters+Collection+%28Art+graphics+Guasman%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58f395ce8c85e7d6c7672a90922f00a6bbbede02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,243,149,206,140,133,231,214,199,103,42,144,146,47,0,166,187,190,222,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
