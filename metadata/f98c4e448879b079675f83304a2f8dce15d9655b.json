Daigo decides to move back to his old hometown with his wife to look for work and start over. He answers a classified ad entitled Ã¢â‚¬Å“DeparturesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ thinking it is an advertisement for a travel agency only to discover that the job is actually for a Ã¢â‚¬Å“NokanshiÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or Ã¢â‚¬Å“encoffineer,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a funeral professional who prepares deceased bodies for burial and entry into the next life. While his wife and others despise the job, Daigo takes a certain pride in his work and begins to perfect the art of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Nokanshi,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ acting as a gentle gatekeeper between life and death, between the departed and the family of the departed.
