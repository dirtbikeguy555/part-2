But how, exactly, does it do that, then? Quite simply, it analyses the audio frequency content in a track/bus via Sidechain, and applies an intelligent 32-band EQ to subtract those frequencies from the channel/bus where TrackSpacer is inserted Ã¢â‚¬â€ giving room or space to a specific track by reducing its frequencies on another track in realtime, in other words!\nIt is not a multiband compressor, it is not a dynamic EQ, it's a completely new approach.\n\n\n\n\n\nSystem requirements:\n\nWindows (XP, Vista, 7, 8).\nVST, VST3  32 bit.\nDAW with sidechain functionality.\n\n\n\n\nInstAlLation\n\n Unrar\n\n Install Trackspacer_full_win_setup_V203.exe.\n\n Replace your VST files using the ones in the VST x86 Crack folder.\n\n Install Serial by double clicking &quot;Install Serial to Registry.reg&quot;\n\nNotes:\nOnly x86 VSTs have been cracked so far.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
