It is the band's second live album behind their live album in 1980. The Eagles had reformed after a fourteen-year-long break up.

The band's lineup consisted of the Long Run era: Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Joe Walsh, Don Felder, and Timothy B. Schmit. The tour would last from 1994Ã¢â‚¬â€œ96 and became one of the most successful tours in music history. The album also features an acoustic version of &quot;Hotel California&quot;.
