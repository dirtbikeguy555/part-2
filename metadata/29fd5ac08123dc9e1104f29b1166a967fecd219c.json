Released in 1997, the game was advertised as &quot;the first real time adventure game&quot;. The story featured &quot;Blade Runner&quot; Ray McCoy searching for replicants in Los Angeles in the year 2019.\n\nWhile it was generally agreed that the game's graphics and sound (music composed by Frank Klepacki) succeeded in adapting the cult film's haunting atmosphere, the designers' attempt at innovating gameplay such as simplifying the interface, adding action elements, replacing a traditional inventory with a database of clues, randomization of some events as well as multiple endings were given mixed reviews.\n\nThe Blade Runner videogame is based on the 1982 movie of the same name. The game is set not long after the beginning of the movie, in November of 2019. Our protagonist, Ray McCoy, is a rookie Bladerunner under command of Guzza, a police officer of superior rank. True to the film, the environment is similar, a dystopian, heavily polluted Los Angeles, brought to life by the fledgling 3D Real Time technology of the day. Also included are some landmarks from the movie, such as the dominating Tyrell pyramid structures.\n\nMcCoy is faced with the task of tracking down a group of replicants and &quot;retiring&quot; (killing) them. The game is unique to the point and click genre in that it begins in a highly complicated fashion, and continues that way till the game's conclusions. You progress through a number of crime scenes, in which you must gather evidence, this is a matter of being highly observative of surroundings as well as using techniques typical of detectives.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/blade-runner/screenshots&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/blade-runner/screenshots&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nExtract Archive With Winrar Or 7zip etc.........\n\nThen Mount Image Or Burn To DVD\n\nInstall The Game And Play\n\n\nENJOY AND PLEASE SEED\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29fd5ac08123dc9e1104f29b1166a967fecd219c","amp;dn":"Blade.Runner%28DVD-ROM.Version%29PC.Game%28djDEVASTATE%C3%A2%E2%80%9E%C2%A2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29fd5ac08123dc9e1104f29b1166a967fecd219c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,253,90,192,129,35,220,158,17,4,242,155,17,102,169,103,254,205,33,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
