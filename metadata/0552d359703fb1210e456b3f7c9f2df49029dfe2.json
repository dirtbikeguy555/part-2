Forbidden Worlds\n\nThe war between the loyalists and the rebels within the TEC, Advent and Vasari continues within the depths of Trader Space. Yet, this sector of the galaxy has far more worlds and far more history than any of the factions are aware. Survival forces each to expand into the unknown, discovering worlds of hazard, wealth, risk, and mystery. Most ominously, the Trader factions have been loathe to expand to these worlds due to the dark myths that surround them.\nKey Features:\nÃ¢â€”Â¾Four new planet types to colonize and exploit (Barren, Ferrus, Greenhouse, Oceanic), each created with beautiful high-res textures. \n\nÃ¢â€”Â¾New Planet Specialization System: Dedicate your worlds to either social or industrial output. Devoting your planet to social improvements will increase its population and culture, at the cost of trade income and ship production. Choosing an industrial path will limit your growth and culture, but make your planet a trading and ship building powerhouse. \n\nÃ¢â€”Â¾15 new research subjects allow the races to conquer and expand onto the forbidden worlds. \n\nÃ¢â€”Â¾Discover 40 new planet bonuses during your exploration of the galaxy, unlocking the dark past of the SinsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ universe. \n\nÃ¢â€”Â¾Unlock five new Steam Achievements and display your mastery of forbidden space! \n\n\n2. Stellar Phenomena\n\nThe ever-expanding conflicts within and between the TEC, Vasari, and Advent have pushed the battlegrounds into uncharted space. The sectors now being drawn into the war feature the most dangerous and powerful natural phenomena in the galaxy. \n\nExploit what resources remain in these dangerous sectors while you can. The uncharted depths of space hold threats beyond any natural phenomenon, and not all of them wait to be explored.\nKey Features\nÃ¢â€”Â¾New stars: Skirt the boundary of a deadly black hole, avoid the deadly radiation of a spinning pulsar, and survive the crushing gravity of an impossibly dense neutron star. \n\nÃ¢â€”Â¾6 new deep space anomalies: Mine the riches in the wreckage of a devastating fleet battle or recharge at an inexplicable fountain of antimatter tearing apart the fabric of space-time. Each anomalyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all-new gameplay effect adds variety and strategic opportunities to every map. \n\nÃ¢â€”Â¾11 dramatic random events: The fate of not just your empire but the galaxy at large will change in a heartbeat with Stellar PhenomenaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s random events enabled. Stars launch volatile gases that shut down orbital operations, mobile storms wreak havoc across the solar system, and conquered factions sense your weakness and seek to reclaim their worlds. \n\n\nIntall:\n\n     1.Unzip Sins_of_a_Solar_Empire_Rebellion_v1.80.4976_STEAM.7z\n   \n     2.Copy cracked files from Folder Crack_1.80 file [NODVD.NET]dzmr-soaser1804976.rar to  Sins_of_a_Solar_Empire_Rebellion Folder\n\n     3.ENJOY\n\n\n\n\n\nVersion 1.80\n\n[ Graphics ]\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Updated ship and structure rendering (specifically the shadowed and non-shadowed shaders).\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Adjusted TEC and Vasari missile speeds/turn rate to be smoother (doesn't affect damage).\n\n[ Gameplay ]\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Adjusted Anarchic Society planet bonus to no longer require exploration (Forbidden Worlds DLC). \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Pirate Cutthroat base damage decreased from 60 to 45; weapon cooldown increased from 5.0 to 5.5.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Pirate Rogue base damage decreased from 40 to 35.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢AntiMedium to Medium damage increased from 1.33333 to 1.5.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢TEC\nÃ¢â€”Â¦Kol Gauss Blast ability updated: The Gauss Blast now bypasses Shields and directly damages the hull of the enemy ship.
