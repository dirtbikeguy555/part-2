In this series, autumn term has begun at Roundview, and a new set of sixth-formers are introduced. Prissy queen-bee Mini (Freya Mavor) is instantly determined to make the life of oddball Franky (Dakota Blue Richards) a living hell. After enlisting her friends Liv and Grace (Laya Lewis and Jessica Sula), and boyfriend Nick (Sean Teale) to launch a smear campaign against her, Mini is less than impressed when Grace jumps ship and sticks up for the new girl. The priapic Alo (Will Merrick) is only interested in girls, while his best friend Rich (Alexander Arnold) is too into his 'heavy metal' exterior to lower himself to 'mainstream' chicks. The episodes comprise: 'Franky', 'Rich', 'Mini', 'Liv', 'Nick', 'Alo', 'Grace' and 'Everyone'.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf0cd5446c2f1a5d903d260697376f71e637dec1","amp;dn":"Skins+S05+Season+5+HDTV+XviD-BiA+%5BMED%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf0cd5446c2f1a5d903d260697376f71e637dec1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,12,213,68,108,47,26,93,144,61,38,6,151,55,111,113,230,55,222,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
