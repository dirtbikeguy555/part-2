Because originally \nonly the first 3 records were gatefold vinyls, we have had to fill the remaining 5 albums with rare outtakes from the original\n album cover artwork.\nOn the sound quality: these are all flat transfers of the original master tapes which means very good sound quality. These discs \nare in no way compressed, clipped or whatever. So you can really crank the volume up without it hurting or becoming unpleasant\n to your ears. They all have very nice dynamics and sound very good to my ears. How a cd really should sound. \n\n===================================================\n\nGenre: Art Rock, Glam, Pop Rock, Prog Rock\nSource: Original master recordings\nCodec: FLAC\nBit Rate: ~ 976 kbps\nBit Depth: 16\nSampling Rates: 44,100 Hz\n\n===================================================\n\nTracklist\n\n~~~~  \tRoxy Music   ~~~~\n\n1-1 \t\tRe-make / Re-model \t5:10 \t\n1-2 \t\tLadytron \t4:21 \t\n1-3 \t\tIf There Is Something \t6:33 \t\n1-4 \t\t2 H.B. \t4:30 \t\n1-5 \t\tThe Bob (Medley) \t5:48 \t\n1-6 \t\tChance Meeting \t3:00 \t\n1-7 \t\tWould You Believe?
