Caught up in one feud too many, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on the verge of becoming a dead barbarian, leaving nothing behind but some bad songs, a few dead friends, and a lot of happy enemies.\n\n&quot;Nobleman, dashing officer, and paragon of selfishness, Captain Jezal dan Luthar has nothing more dangerous in mind than fleecing his friends as cards and dreaming of glory in the fencing circle. But war is brewing, and on the battlefields of the frozen North they fight by altogether bloodier rules.\n\n&quot;Inquisitor Glokta, cripple turned torturer, would like nothing better than to see Jezal come home in a jar. But then Glokta hates everyone: cutting treason out of the Union one confession at a time leaves little room for friendships. His latest trail of corpses may lead him right to the rotten heart of governmentÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ if he can stay alive long enough to follow it.\n\n&quot;Murderous conspiracies rise to the surface, old scores are ready to be settled, and the line between hero and villain is sharp enough to draw blood. Unpredictable, compelling, wickedly funny, and packed with unforgettable characters, The Blade Itself is fantasy with a real cutting edge.&quot;\n\n\nA review can be found here: http://www.bestfantasybooks.com/top25-fantasy-books.php\n\n\n\nRead for you by  Steven Pacey.\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\n-Ventricle\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77f8930401ac16b53c7c7ae36ceadfacec8e1c47","amp;dn":"The+Blade+Itself+-+Joe+Abercrombie+-+Unabridged","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77f8930401ac16b53c7c7ae36ceadfacec8e1c47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,248,147,4,1,172,22,181,60,124,122,227,108,234,223,172,236,142,28,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
