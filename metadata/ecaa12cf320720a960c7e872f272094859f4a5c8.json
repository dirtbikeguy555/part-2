She spent her teens hitchhiking, committing petty theft, and dumpster diving. By twenty-two, she had resigned herself to employment, but was still broke, directionless, and working a mediocre day job sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d taken for the health insurance.\n\nIt was there that Sophia decided to start selling vintage clothes on eBay. Eight years later, she is the founder, CEO, and creative director of Nasty Gal, a $100 million plus online fashion retailer with more than 350 employees. SophiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never been a typical CEO, or a typical anything, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s written #GIRLBOSS for outsiders (and insiders) seeking a unique path to success, even when that path is winding as all hell and lined with naysayers.\n\n#GIRLBOSS includes SophiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story, yet is infinitely bigger than Sophia. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deeply personal yet universal. Filled with brazen wake-up calls (Ã¢â‚¬Å“You are not a special snowflakeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), cunning and frank observations (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Failure is your inventionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), and behind-the-scenes stories from Nasty GalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s meteoric rise, #GIRLBOSS covers a lot of ground. It proves that being successful isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t about how popular you were in high school or where you went to college (if you went to college). Rather, success is about trusting your instincts and following your gut, knowing which rules to follow and which to break.\n\nA #GIRLBOSS takes her life seriously without taking herself too seriously. She takes chances and takes responsibility on her own terms. . She knows when to throw punches and when to roll with them. When to button up and when to let her freak flag fly.\n\nAs Sophia writes, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I have three pieces of advice I want you to remember: DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ever grow up. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t become a bore. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let The Man get to you. OK? Cool. Then letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s do this.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecaa12cf320720a960c7e872f272094859f4a5c8","amp;dn":"%23Girlboss+-+Sophia+Amoruso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecaa12cf320720a960c7e872f272094859f4a5c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,170,18,207,50,7,32,169,96,199,232,114,242,114,9,72,89,244,165,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
