Learn How to Rise to the Occasion of Your Life\n\n\nFile type: M4B\n\nSize: 86 MB\n\nTime : 5 hours and 36 mins\n\nISBN: 1936740524\n\n \n\n\nWhat are you waiting for? Do you find yourself waiting for the right moment? The ideal relationship? The perfect job? Are you waiting for your &quot;real&quot; life to begin? Do you think that the gifts of life are right around the corner? That one day you will arrive and everything will be okay? Do you endlessly search, yet never seem to find? \nThrough the sharing of authentic personal stories and profound life lessons, Kristen Moeller explores our pervasive human tendency to wait for life and to look outside ourselves for answers. So we don't try; we give up. We sell out and we forget who we are. We are afraid to succeed, afraid to fail, and afraid to say we are afraid. But as Wayne Gretzky said, &quot;You'll always miss one-hundred percent of the shots you don't take!&quot; Kristen Moeller's mission in life is to inspire you to get on the path, move forward and take the shot. \n\n\n\n \n\n\nHow to use:\n\n* Open it with any media/audio player (Before, install k-lite codec pack (opt.))...\n\n\n* Enjoy &amp; SEED! \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d464ed0aea7c8f8ca9a77d69305e4d666e7cdef7","amp;dn":"What+are+You+Waiting+For%3F+Learn+How+to+Rise","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d464ed0aea7c8f8ca9a77d69305e4d666e7cdef7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,100,237,10,234,124,143,140,169,167,125,105,48,94,77,102,110,124,222,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
