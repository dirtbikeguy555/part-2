These were all found through tons of different downloads that are years old, and I felt that since there's new material that there might as well be a new updated library in torrent form.\n\n\n\nSUGGESTED PROGRAMS FOR YOUR READING ENJOYMENT:\n\n*CDisplayEX (.cbr files)\n*Calibre (.epub &amp; .mobi)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeed, please.
