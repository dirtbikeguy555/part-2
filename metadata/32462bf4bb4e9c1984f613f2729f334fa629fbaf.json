However, a handbook that provides established M&amp;S practices has not been available. Until now. Modeling and Simulation-Based Systems Engineering Handbook details the M&amp;S practices for supporting systems engineering in diverse domains. It discusses how you can identify systems engineering needs and adapt these practices to suit specific application domains, thus avoiding redefining practices from scratch.\n\nAlthough M&amp;S practices are used and embedded within individual disciplines, they are often developed in isolation. However, they address recurring problems common to all disciplines. The editors of this book tackled the challenge by recruiting key representatives from several communities, harmonizing the different perspectives derived from individual backgrounds, and lining them up with the bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s vision. The result is a collection of M&amp;S systems engineering examples that offer an initial means for cross-domain capitalization of the knowledge, methodologies, and technologies developed in several communities. These examples provide the pros and cons of the methods and techniques available, lessons learned, and pitfalls to avoid.\n\nAs our society moves further in the information era, knowledge and M&amp;S capabilities become key enablers for the engineering of complex systems and systems of systems. Therefore, knowledge and M&amp;S methodologies and technologies become valuable output in an engineering activity, and their cross-domain capitalization is key to further advance the future practices in systems engineering. This book collates information across disciplines to provide you with the tools to more efficiently design and manage complex systems that achieve their goals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32462bf4bb4e9c1984f613f2729f334fa629fbaf","amp;dn":"Modeling+and+Simulation-Based+Systems+Engineering+Handbook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32462bf4bb4e9c1984f613f2729f334fa629fbaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,70,43,244,187,78,156,25,132,246,19,242,114,159,51,79,166,41,251,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
