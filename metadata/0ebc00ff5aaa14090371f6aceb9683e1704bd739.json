CortÃ¡zar influenced an entire generation of Spanish-speaking readers and writers in the Americas and Europe.  He has been called both a &quot;modern master of the short story&quot; and, by Carlos Fuentes, &quot;the SimÃ³n BolÃ­var of the novel.&quot;\r\n\r\nCortÃ¡zar's masterpiece, HOPSCOTCH (1963), is an open-ended, stream-of-consciousness novel, or counter-novel, in which the reader is invited to rearrange the different parts of the novel according to a plan prescribed by the author.  It was the first of the &quot;boom&quot; of Latin American novels of the 1960s to gain international attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following books are in PDF and/or ePUB format as indicated:\r\n\r\n* 62: A Model Kit (New Directions, 2013).
