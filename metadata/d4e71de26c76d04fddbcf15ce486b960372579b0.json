But the arrival of her fearsome uncle, Lord Asriel, draws her to the heart of a terrible struggleÃ¢â‚¬â€a struggle born of Gobblers and stolen children, witch clans and armored bears. And as she hurtles toward danger in the cold, far North, young Lyra never suspects the shocking truth: She alone is destined to win, or to lose, this more-than-mortal battle.\n\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nBOOK 2 :- The Subtle Knife: His Dark Materials\n\n\nLyra finds herself in a shimmering, haunted underworldÃ¢â‚¬â€CittÃƒÂ gazze, where soul-eating Specters stalk the streets and wingbeats of distant angels sound against the sky. But she is not without allies: 12-year-old Will Parry, fleeing for his life after taking anotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, has also stumbled into this strange new realm.\n\nOn a perilous journey from world to world, Lyra and Will discover an object of devastating power. And with every step, they move closer to an even greater threatÃ¢â‚¬â€and the shattering truth of their own destiny.\n\n \n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nBOOK 3:- The Amber Spyglass: His Dark Materials\n\n\nIn the astonishing finale to the His Dark Materials trilogy, Lyra and Will are in unspeakable danger. With help from Iorek Byrnison the armored bear and two tiny Gallivespian spies, they must journey to a dank and gray-lit world where no living soul has ever gone. All the while, Dr. Mary Malone builds a magnificent Amber Spyglass. An assassin hunts her down, and Lord Asriel, with a troop of shining angels, fights his mighty rebellion, in a battle of strange alliesÃ¢â‚¬â€and shocking sacrifice.\n\nAs war rages and Dust drains from the sky, the fate of the livingÃ¢â‚¬â€and the deadÃ¢â‚¬â€finally comes to depend on two children and the simple truth of one simple story.\n\n\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Dark_Materials&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Dark_Materials&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPlease note that I just took iDeusEx's torrent;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8492697/His_Dark_Materials_Omnibus_%28The_Golden_Compass__The_Subtle_Knife&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8492697/His_Dark_Materials_Omnibus_%28The_Golden_Compass__The_Subtle_Knife&lt;/a&gt;\n\nand edited the eBook files manually to put back lines removed/edited in the US version.\nLet me know if I messed up the files in someway I didn't notice, but as far as I can tell it turned out right, and the mobi file reads on my kindle.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4e71de26c76d04fddbcf15ce486b960372579b0","amp;dn":"His+Dark+Materials+Omnibus+-+Philip+Pullman+%28unedited%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4e71de26c76d04fddbcf15ce486b960372579b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,231,29,226,108,118,208,79,221,188,241,92,228,134,185,96,55,37,121,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
