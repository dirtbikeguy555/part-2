While this book can't quite promise all of that, Watson offers an intriguing selection of lines that give vast scope for over-the-board creativity and should never lead to a dull draw.\nThe repertoire is based on 1 d4 and 2 c4, following up with methodical play in the centre. Watson uses his vast opening knowledge to pick cunning move-orders and poisonous sequences that will force opponents to think for themselves, providing a true test of chess understanding. Throughout, he discusses strategies for both sides, so readers will be fully ready to pounce on any inaccuracies, and have all the tools to decide on the most appropriate plans for White.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:302094bb47d3907fe5a15f0f5ff4211e975abe78","amp;dn":"A+Strategic+Chess+Opening+Repertoire+for+White.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"302094bb47d3907fe5a15f0f5ff4211e975abe78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,32,148,187,71,211,144,127,229,161,95,15,95,244,33,30,151,90,190,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
