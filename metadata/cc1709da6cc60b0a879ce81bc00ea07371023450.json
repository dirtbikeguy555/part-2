A distinctive singer-songwriter, Sayer was a top singles and album act on both sides of the Atlantic in the 1970s. His first seven hit singles in the UK all reached the Top 10 - a feat first registered by his one-time manager, Adam Faith. From his first hit with &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; in 1973 to the present day, Sayer has never been missing from the charts for longer than five successive years.\n\n\n\n\t1.\tWhen I Need You\t\n\t2.\tShow Must Go On, \n\t3.\tOne Man Band  \t\n\t4.\tLong Tall Glasses  \t\n\t5.\tMoonlighting  \t\n\t6.\tYou Make Me Feel Like Dancing  \n\t7.\tHow Much Love  \t\n\t8.\tThunder in My Heart  \t\n\t9.\tI Can't Stop Loving You (Though I Try)  \t\n\t10.\tRaining in My Heart  \t\n\t11.\tMore Than I Can Say  \t\n\t12.\tHave You Ever Been in Love?  \t\n\t13.\tHeart (Stop Beating in Time)  \t\n\t14.\tOrchard Road  \t\n\t15.\tLiving in a Fantasy  \t\n\t16.\tGiving It All Away  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc1709da6cc60b0a879ce81bc00ea07371023450","amp;dn":"Leo+Sayer+-+The+Very+Best+Of+CDRip+%5BCov%2BCD%5D%5BBubanee%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc1709da6cc60b0a879ce81bc00ea07371023450","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,23,9,218,108,198,11,10,135,156,232,27,192,14,160,115,113,2,52,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
