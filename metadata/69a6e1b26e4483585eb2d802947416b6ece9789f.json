Now comes Motive, which pits psychologist Alex Delaware and homicide cop Milo Sturgis against a vicious criminal mindÃ¢â‚¬â€the kind only Kellerman can bring to chilling life.\n \nEven having hundreds of closed cases to his credit canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t keep LAPD police lieutenant Milo Sturgis from agonizing over the crimes that donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get solvedÃ¢â‚¬â€and the victims who go without justice. Victims like Katherine Hennepin, a young woman strangled and stabbed in her home. A single suspect with a solid alibi leads to a dead endÃ¢â‚¬â€one even Alex DelawareÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s expert insight canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t explain. The only thing to do is move on to the next murder caseÃ¢â‚¬â€because thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always a next one.\n \nThis time the victim is Ursula Corey: a successful, attractive divorcÃƒÂ©e whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been gunned downÃ¢â‚¬â€not a robbery but an execution, a crime that smacks of simple, savage revenge. And along with that theoretical motive come two strong contenders for the role of perp: the dead womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s business partner/ex-husband and her divorce lawyer/secret lover. But just as Alex and Milo think theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re zeroing in on the most likely suspect, a bizarre new clue stirs up eerie echoes of the unsolved Hennepin murder. And the discovery of yet another crime scene bearing the same taunting signature raises the specter of a serial killer on a mission, whose twisted method is exceeded only by his manipulative and cunning madness","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69a6e1b26e4483585eb2d802947416b6ece9789f","amp;dn":"Motive+by+Jonathan+Kellerman+%5BePub%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69a6e1b26e4483585eb2d802947416b6ece9789f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,166,225,178,110,68,131,88,94,178,216,2,148,116,22,182,236,233,120,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
