IMO that's\r\na bit sloppy, but to each his own. At least the author included a\r\nway to disable it.\r\n\r\nWhy bother disabling it? Well, CODYQX4 will make a proper version of\r\nMTK2.6 that will handle the activation better, some time in the near future.\r\nThere are also a few other tools that you may prefer. Having a task in\r\nyour system for a program you no longer use is bad, hence the modding.\r\n\r\nI will include links to KMS_VL_ALL project and MTK project in the torrent\r\ndirectory so you can get the latest or unmodded versions. CODYQX4 will\r\ntake longer to make his proper MTK tool, but he always has insanely high\r\nquality on them that typically does not require any updates.\r\n\r\nAlternatively there's KMSPico by Heldigard. I &lt;3 Heldigard. Him and I\r\nwhere the first people to make a pre-activated Win8 release. He is still\r\none of the most creative tool makers I know of. I'll toss in a link to\r\nthe KMSPico page as well.\r\n\r\nIf you ask me which I'd prefer, I'd say MTK, but I love them all and they\r\nall work as intended, typically. Note that MTK2.6-beta1 currently will\r\nhang up on multiple Office2016 products, so hold off until a newer version.\r\n\r\nOn the issue of installing specific things, I don't know. You will need\r\nto test the various tools yourself. I will make no claim as often updates\r\nto system may interfere with things like that. It really depends how\r\nfutureproof they make the tool.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nCODYQX4 - Microsoft Toolkit\r\nHeldigard - KMSPico\r\nmurphy78 - Testing and ISO design/integration\r\nqewlpal, abbodi1406, and crew - KMS_VL_ALL 6.x\r\n\r\nEnjoy,\r\nmurph","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9d2de25240a1b7e7d295aabd1b733b5e8d7b14e","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Office+2016+VL+ProPlus+Visio+Project+64-bit","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9d2de25240a1b7e7d295aabd1b733b5e8d7b14e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,210,222,37,36,10,27,126,125,41,90,171,209,183,51,181,232,215,177,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
