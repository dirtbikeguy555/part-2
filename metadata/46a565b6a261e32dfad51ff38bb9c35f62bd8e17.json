In Japanese homes, mothers usually prepare meals based on traditional cooking styles with some influence from Western or Chinese cuisines. These Western and Chinese-influenced dishes are called yofu and chuka respectively. A typical Japanese meal would include a rice (gohan) or noodle(men-rui) dish served with meat or seafood. These would come served with side dishes such as salads or simmered dishesconsisting of vegetables, tofu, various kinds of seaweed, picklesand soup. You will often find four to five dishes laid out on a table.These dishes can also be packed into bento boxes to be brought to the office or school. \nOther than the three main meals of the day, the Japanese are known to enjoy snacks or desserts in the afternoons. Known as san-ji-no-oyatsu or teatime, traditional snacks such as glutinous rice balls(dango) coated with sweet soy sauce and chilled jelly with fruit(anmitsu) are served together with tea. These days, you will alsofind Western-style sweets such as ice cream, pastries and cakes served at teatime.\nWhen it comes to cooking at home, most households would havethe basic ingredients stocked in the kitchen. These seasoningsand sauces are the foundations of most Japanese dishes. They areJapanese soy sauce (shoyu), soy bean paste (miso), sweetened ricewine (mirin) and rice wine (sake). Various kinds of seaweed areusually used in home cooking too as Japan is surrounded by the sea.The most commonly used variety is kelp (konbu), which forms the basis for cooking stock called dashi, which is used to prepare misosoups, noodle broths and simmered dishes. \nThanks to the increased popularity of Japanese cuisine, Japanese ingredients are easy to find even outside of Japan. I have alsoensured that the recipes included in this cookbook use products andingredients which are widely and easily available. While it is easy to find popular Japanese dishes at restaurants, thereis a whole repertoire of Japanese home-style cooking not well-known outside of the country. These dishes are well-loved by Japanese families and in this cookbook to introduce you to the wide variety of Japanese classics. With step-by-step photographs and an easy-to-follow format, this book helps you discover the joy of Japanese cooking at home.
