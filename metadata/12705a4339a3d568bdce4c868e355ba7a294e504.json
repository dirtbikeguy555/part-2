A series of sketches depict the unfolding of his life from boyhood, through the era of the first World War, to his eventual Cambridge professorship and association with Bertrand Russell and John Maynard Keynes. The emphasis in these sketches is on the exposition of the ideas of Wittgenstein, a homosexual, and an intuitive, moody, proud, and perfectionistic thinker generally regarded as a genius.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12705a4339a3d568bdce4c868e355ba7a294e504","amp;dn":"Wittgenstein+%281993%29+DVDRip+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12705a4339a3d568bdce4c868e355ba7a294e504","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,112,90,67,57,163,213,104,189,206,76,134,142,53,91,167,162,148,229,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
