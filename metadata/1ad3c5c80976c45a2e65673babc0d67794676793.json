This save file can now be used for your New Game +.\n\n-Quit back to the game's main menu and select 'new game'. From here, select your difficulty level and Witcher 2 save simulation as normal, and then a third option will present itself. When asked if you wish to begin New Game +, select 'ON' and then choose the save file that you wish to use.\n\nAnd there you have it.
