As such no tool has to date been able to create a satisfactory\ntranscode of this show.\n\nThis encode tackles each of the problems indicated as follows:\n1. Produce a hybrid (variable frame rate) video that alternates between 24 and\n   30 FPS, depending on whether the scene is a FILM or (CGI) VIDEO sequence.\n2. Decimate the 1 in 5 duplicates that result from inverse telecine of FILM\n   scenes, but skip decimation of VIDEO scenes (to allow smooth playback of\n   video and film sequences alike).\n3. Combat the aliased and incorrectly mastered CGI graphics by leveraging\n   advanced video analysis and correction techniques (QTGMC-like enhancement).\n4. Reduce the enormous amount of grain that is at times overwhelming and quite\n   distracting, in scenes not well lit. There are a lot of them in this show.\n\nThe video encoding was painstakingly prepared over several weeks, with AVI\nSynth pre-processing applied before the actual x264 encode.\n\nThe audio is the original, ripped unchanged from the DVD without any \ntranscoding or alteration.\n\nNote: Not all media players are able to handle variable frame rate (VFR) clips, so check out the quality and whether or not your player can handle these to your satisfaction, by prioritizing the sample.mkv file in the torrent. Players known to handle VFR clips very well include VLC and Media Player Home Cinema. MPlayer have had some issues in the past. There may be other candidates, but I haven't tested them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d14d217dc871fcab68334f32154419856d089df2","amp;dn":"Babylon5+Season+1-5+DVDrip+x264+AC3+%5BHQ+encode%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d14d217dc871fcab68334f32154419856d089df2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,77,33,125,200,113,252,171,104,51,79,50,21,68,25,133,109,8,157,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
