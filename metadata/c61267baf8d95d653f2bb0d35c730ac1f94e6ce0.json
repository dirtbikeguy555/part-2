In theory, a well-developed MVC system should allow a front-end developer and a back-end developer to work on the same system without interfering, sharing, or editing files either party is working on.\n\nEven though MVC was originally designed for personal computing, it has been adapted and is widely used by web developers due to its emphasis on separation of concerns, and thus indirectly, reusable code. The pattern encourages the development of modular systems, allowing developers to quickly update, add, or even remove functionality.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.udemy.com/learn-php-model-view-controller-pattern-php-mvc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.udemy.com/learn-php-model-view-controller-pattern-php-mvc&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c61267baf8d95d653f2bb0d35c730ac1f94e6ce0","amp;dn":"Udemy-+Learn+PHP+Model+View+Controller+Pattern+%28PHP+MVC%29+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c61267baf8d95d653f2bb0d35c730ac1f94e6ce0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,18,103,186,248,217,93,101,63,43,176,211,92,115,10,193,249,78,108,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
