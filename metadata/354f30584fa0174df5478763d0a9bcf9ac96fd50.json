Good thing, because heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s being chased by not one but two goddesses of the hunt - Artemis and Diana - for messing with one of their own. Dodging their slings and arrows, Atticus, Granuaile, and his wolfhound Oberon are making a mad dash across modern-day Europe to seek help from a friend of the Tuatha DÃƒÂ© Danann. His usual magical option of shifting planes is blocked, so instead of playing hide-and-seek, the game plan is...run like hell.\nCrashing the pantheon marathon is the Norse god Loki. Killing Atticus is the only loose end he needs to tie up before unleashing Ragnarok - AKA the Apocalypse. Atticus and Granuaile have to outfox the Olympians and contain the god of mischief if they want to go on living - and still have a world to live in.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16071950-hunted&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16071950-hunted&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:354f30584fa0174df5478763d0a9bcf9ac96fd50","amp;dn":"Kevin+Hearne+-+Hunted+%28epub+%26amp%3B+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"354f30584fa0174df5478763d0a9bcf9ac96fd50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,79,48,88,79,160,23,77,245,71,135,99,208,169,188,249,172,150,253,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
