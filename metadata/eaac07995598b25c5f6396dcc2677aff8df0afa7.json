This could have been just a nostalgic retro gathering 25 years after the fact, but instead, these guys put forth an ambitious effort to push the boundaries of the idiom.\n\nThe centerpiece is a 15-minute trumpet concerto for Gillespie called &quot;Oro, Incienso y Mirra,&quot; where O'Farrill melts dissonant clusters, electric piano comping, and synthesizer decorations together with hot Afro-Cuban rhythms into a coherent, multi-sectioned tour de force. Gillespie, who had apparently never been in the same room with synthesizers before, is magnificent as he peels off one patented bebop run after another over Machito's band and in the gaps between. There is also an equally sophisticated suite of O'Farrill pieces grouped under the title &quot;Three Afro-Cuban Jazz Moods,&quot; which mixes rock elements into the rhythms. Parts of &quot;Pensativo&quot; sound as if O'Farrill had been carefully listening to Santana, the teacher learning from the student, as it were. \n\nIt adds up to a paltry 32 minutes of music, yet one can forgive the short length, this being all there is of a historic recording session . . .\n\n\n\n\nDIZZY GILLESPIE and MACHITO  with Orchestra\n\nAfro Cuban Jazz Moods      1975\n\n\n- CD\n- 320Kbps\n\n\nSoloist                    Dizzy Gillespie      Trumpet\nArranger and Conductor     Chico OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Farrill\nLeader                     Machito\n\n\nRecorded at Generation Sound Studios, NYC, June 4th and 5th, 1975\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eaac07995598b25c5f6396dcc2677aff8df0afa7","amp;dn":"Dizzy+Gillespie+%26amp%3B+Machito+-+Afro+Cuban+Jazz+Moods+1975+-+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eaac07995598b25c5f6396dcc2677aff8df0afa7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,172,7,153,85,152,178,92,95,99,150,220,194,103,122,255,141,240,175,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
