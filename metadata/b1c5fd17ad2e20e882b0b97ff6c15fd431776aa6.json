This is their first album featuring Ronnie James Dio, and first with producer Martin Birch. Heaven and Hell became one of Black Sabbath's best-selling albums, revitalising Sabbath's fortunes after what many saw as the death of the group following original lead singer Ozzy Osbourne's departure.\n\nThis was the first album after singer Ozzy Osbourne was fired from the band and replaced with Ronnie James Dio. Geoff Nicholls of Quartz also joined the band as a possible replacement for Geezer Butler who had not been around through most of the writing sessions and was going through a divorce at the time. When Butler decided to stay with the group, Nicholls switched to keyboards. Nicholls remained as Black Sabbath's keyboard player for over twenty years, usually playing live shows from off-stage.\n\nFormer Elf and Rainbow bassist Craig Gruber also rehearsed with the band. Gruber's involvement appears to be a point of debate. In a 1996 interview, Tony Iommi mentions that Gruber played with the band for &quot;a bit&quot;. Gruber has stated that his time with the band was much more substantial and that he only left the group once Butler decided to return.\n\nDrummer Bill Ward completed this album and toured with the band through August, but drinking and other personal factors would eventually prevent him from completing the Black and Blue Tour which featured Black Sabbath and Blue Oyster Cult. Ward's mid-tour replacement Vinny Appice would become an official member.\n\nHeaven And Hell - DELUXE EDITION [320k MP3]\n\nDeluxe Edition Disc 1\n\n    &quot;Neon Knights&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54\n    &quot;Children of the Sea&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:35\n    &quot;Lady Evil&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:26\n    &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:00\n    &quot;Wishing Well&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08\n    &quot;Die Young&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:46\n    &quot;Walk Away&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:26\n    &quot;Lonely is the Word&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:53\n\nDeluxe Edition Disc 2\n\n    Children of the Sea (Live, Single B-Side, SAB3) - 6:24\n    Heaven and Hell (Live, Single B-Side, SAB4) - 7:19\n    Lady Evil (Mono Edit, 7&quot; Single, WBS 495549) - 3:54\n    Neon Knights (Live, Hartford, CT, USA, 1980) - 4:49\n    Children of the Sea (Live, Hartford, CT, USA 1980) - 5:58\n    Heaven and Hell (Live, Hartford, CT, USA 1980 &amp; 12&quot; Single Version) - 12:34\n    Die Young (Live, Hartford, CT, USA 1980) - 4:36\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Ronnie James Dio ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals\n    Tony Iommi ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar\n    Geezer Butler ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass\n    Bill Ward ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1c5fd17ad2e20e882b0b97ff6c15fd431776aa6","amp;dn":"Black+Sabbath+-+Heaven+And+Hell+%5BDELUXE%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1c5fd17ad2e20e882b0b97ff6c15fd431776aa6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,197,253,23,173,46,32,232,130,176,185,127,246,193,95,212,49,119,106,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
