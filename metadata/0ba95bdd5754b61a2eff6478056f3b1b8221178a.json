There is also an IV50 Codec installer (I've included it in the METT.iso) that needs to be installed before running or the videos will not play in the METT.\n\nThe METT and the FACS are ISO's and can be mounted with daemon tools. For the less experienced who dont want to or cant use daemon tools its as easy as burning the ISO's to a CD with Nero or your other favorite burning software (I like Magic ISO). All the other files are basically idiot proof. Just PDF books, AVI video and MP3. If your really having problems just use Foxit reader for the PDF's and VLC Media Player for the MP3's and AVI.\n\nSo I hope I've answered any questions you might have. If not just post a comment and I'll try to get back to you ASAP. Thanks for downloading and PLEASE SEED!!!\n\nList of Things Included:\n1. Micro Expression Training Tool (METT CD)\n2. Facial Action Coding System (FACS CD) &lt;-- A must for Micro expression Training (more in depth info)\n3. David Lieberman - Never Be Lied To Again Part's 1&amp;2 &lt;-- (mp3 version of the basic's of expression detection)\n4. Emotions Revealed &lt;-- (PDF of Dr. Paul Ekman's book)\n5. Unmasking the Face &lt;-- (Also a PDF of Dr. Paul Ekman's book)\n6. Telling Lies &lt;-- (Also a PDF of Dr. Paul Ekman's book)\n7. Frogs Into Princes: Neuro Linguistic Programming &lt;-- (A PDF of a book by Richard Bandler)\n8. The Truth About Liars &lt;-- (A documentary about how and why people lie)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ba95bdd5754b61a2eff6478056f3b1b8221178a","amp;dn":"Micro+Expression+Training+%28Becoming+a+Living+Lie+Detector%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ba95bdd5754b61a2eff6478056f3b1b8221178a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,169,91,221,87,84,182,26,46,255,100,120,5,111,59,27,130,33,23,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
