Simmons was raised from an early age by his aunt in Yonkers, New York. He took his name from the DMX digital sound machine, and developed a reputation as a DJ on the local projects. He won Source magazine's Unsigned Hype Award in January 1991, and released the promo single &quot;Born Loser&quot; for Columbia Records the following year. He managed to escape from Columbia's punitive contract, but little was heard from him afterwards apart from a 1994 single, &quot;Make A Move&quot;. He made a dramatic re-entry onto the hip-hop scene with a show stopping appearance on LL Cool J's &quot;4,3,2,1&quot;. Further cameos on Ma$e's &quot;24 Hours To Live&quot;, the LOX's &quot;Money, Power &amp; Respect&quot; and the remix of Ice Cube's &quot;We Be Clubbin'&quot; built up a highly marketable reputation. Newly signed to Ruff Ryders/Def Jam Records, DMX returned to recording with the powerful &quot;Get At Me Dog&quot; single, a US Top 40 single built around a B.T. Express guitar sample. Marketed as a return to the chaotic, raw roots of street rap, he became hip-hop's latest sensation during 1998 when his debut album, It's Dark And Hell Is Hot, entered the US Billboard album chart at number 1. \r\n\r\n[b]DMX â€Žâ€“ It's Dark And Hell Is Hot\r\nGenre:[/b] Hip Hop\r\n[b]Year:[/b] 1998\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/m2aIEij.png[/img]\r\n\r\nExact Audio Copy V1.1 from 23.
