Phonetics is a required course among students of speech pathology and linguistics, and it's a popular elective among students of telecommunications and forensics. The first popular guide to this fascinating discipline, Phonetics For Dummies is an excellent overview of the field for students enrolled in introductory phonetics courses and an ideal introduction for anyone with an interest in the field.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:638efcdc741b321e854e804d210aa59dd98044d5","amp;dn":"Phonetics+For+Dummies+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"638efcdc741b321e854e804d210aa59dd98044d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,142,252,220,116,27,50,30,133,78,128,77,33,10,165,157,217,128,68,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
