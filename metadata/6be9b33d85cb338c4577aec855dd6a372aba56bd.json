Frank Grieves is a 'Dreck', a roaming narc responsible for keeping the black market dealers off the streets and the licenced drugs companies rich. When he discovers a rogue substance in an unidentified corpse, evidence suggests that Ambro, the most powerful drug manufacturer of all, are conducting secret tests on an experimental narcotic. Grieves discovers a second victim - this time alive - but she disappears and he is suddenly taken off the case by his superiors. As his options drain away, it's clear that legalization has come at a heavy price. Is it too late to save the city? \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6be9b33d85cb338c4577aec855dd6a372aba56bd","amp;dn":"Narcopolis+%282015%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6be9b33d85cb338c4577aec855dd6a372aba56bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,233,179,61,133,203,51,140,69,119,174,200,85,221,106,55,42,186,86,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
