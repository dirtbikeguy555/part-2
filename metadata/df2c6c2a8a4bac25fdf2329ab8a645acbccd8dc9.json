Understanding ISO 9001:2000 from an engineer's perspective ensures that software, hardware, and systems engineering organizations will continue to develop, maintain and evolve their engineering practices long after the consultants are gone. ISO 9001:2000 for Software and Systems Providers: An Engineering Approach provides proven strategies for using ISO 9001 to implement and revitalize systematic process improvements within software, hardware, and systems engineering organizations.\n\nWritten by engineers for engineers, the authors incorporate more than a decade of experience implementing ISO 9001 in engineering organizations of all types. They present a well-defined roadmap that any engineering organization can follow to secure the maximum benefits from the standard. Their roadmap has proven effective in small and large organizations, from Silicon-Valley-based startups to established defense contractors.\n\n\nThis volume dissects and analyzes each paragraph of ISO 9001 from an engineering perspective, clarifying the relationship to engineering practices and the potential benefits to the organization. This volume also stresses the relationships among the paragraphs, which can have a critical impact on the efficiency of the ISO implementation.\n\n\n\n\nimage\nScientia est potentia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df2c6c2a8a4bac25fdf2329ab8a645acbccd8dc9","amp;dn":"ISO+9001-2000+for+Software+and+Systems+Providers+%5BPDF%5D%7EStormRG%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df2c6c2a8a4bac25fdf2329ab8a645acbccd8dc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,44,108,42,138,75,172,37,253,242,50,154,184,166,69,172,188,205,141,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
