Manually BLOCK EACH AND EVERY Nero 9 APPLICATION with Windows Firewall, or if you use a third party firewall...for example:\n\nI want to block Nero 9 (Nero Burning ROM) go to the firewall, and manually add, not from the actual (C:) drive, but from your firewall, when done, APPLY, and CLOSE (some firewalls are different when making such add/delete/modify changes)\n\nLOOK IN (C:)&gt;Program Files(x86)&gt;Nero&gt;Nero 9 \n \nNero StartSmart BLOCK .EXE\nNero ShowTime BLOCK .EXE\nNero DiscSpeed BLOCK .EXE\nNero DiscCopy Gadget blocking not required\nNero WaveEditor BLOCK .EXE\nNero SoundTrax BLOCK .EXE\nNero Recode BLOCK .EXE\nNero PhotoSnap BLOCK .EXE\nNero Burning ROM BLOCK .EXE\nNero Express BLOCK .EXE\nNero CoverDesigner BLOCK .EXE\nNero Vision BLOCK .EXE\nNero DriveSpeed BLOCK .EXE\nNero BurnRights BLOCK .EXE\nNero REscueAgent BLOCK .EXE\nNero InfoTool BLOCK .EXE\nNero PhotoSnap Viewer BLOCK BOTH PHOTOSNAP.EXE AND PHOTOSNAP VIEWER.EXE\nNero ControlCenter BLOCK .EXE\n\nLOOK IN (C:)&gt;Program Files(x86)&gt;Nero&gt;Nero ControlCenter4\nBLOCK ncc.exe\n\nLOOK IN (C:)&gt;Program Files(x86)&gt;Common Files&gt;Nero&gt;Nero BackItUp4\nBLOCK NBCore.exe\nBLOCK NBService.exe\n\nIf you have add-on(s) such as MoveIt, or BackItUp and Burn, you also need to BLOCK  .exe too...for example:\n\n(C:)Program Files(x86)&gt;Nero&gt;Nero BackItUp &amp; Burn&gt;Nero BackItUp (.exe)\n\nNOTE: Make sure you are only running ONE firewall, if not sure, check: Control Panel&gt;System and Security&gt;Windows Firewall\nNOTE: there is a few .exe to block so please pay attention.\n\nI hope this updated step regarding the blocking of .exe will help some people:)\nThere is also another option to block using the batch File posted on Page11 (courtesy of user trueblu8) \n \n7.) Reboot\n\n8.)When your back on your computer, just double check all your steps, cause really, do you want to do this all over again? naaaa i didn't think so:)\n\nNOTE: Check Control Panel&gt;Programs&gt;Programs and Features&gt;should say Nero 9, not Nero 9 trial, but in case it does, no biggie, honestly.\n\n9.) RE-ENABLE ANTI-VIRUS (AV) PROGRAM, then reconnect to the internet.\n\n10.) Start Nero 9 FULL, and enjoy:) \n\nI decided to update and add more specific info to better help my fellow PirateBay users, so they enjoy using Nero 9 FULL, instead of scrolling for help in the comment section, but there's nothing wrong with that either:)\n\nIN CASE YOU MESS UP-------------------&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nero.com/enu/tools-utilities.html#tab4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nero.com/enu/tools-utilities.html#tab4&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDownload the Nero General CleanTool, save this file to your desktop.
