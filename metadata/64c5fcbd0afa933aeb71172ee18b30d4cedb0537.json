I have compiled a \ncollection of instrumental tracks from fan blogs and youtube for your \nenjoyment, as well as live performances, remixes Adam has done of other\nsongs, covers, and other songs that feature Adam's vocals. All tracks \nare in AAC format with a bit rate of 256 or 320 kbps, and have been \ncarefully edited in iTunes already, so importing should be really quick. \nAll of the full-length Owl City albums (including Of June), were ripped \ndirectly from purchased hard-copy CDs. Please seed as much as is \nconvenient.
