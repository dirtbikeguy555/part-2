Packed with timely, relevant applications, the text emphasizes incorporates close to 100 intriguing data sets in six formats and offers updates that reflect the latest emerging developments in the field.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout the Author:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJeffrey M.
