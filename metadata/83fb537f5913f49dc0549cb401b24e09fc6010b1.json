(Chaos Anno Domini) is the fifth studio album by Brazilian heavy metal band Sepultura, released in late 1993 through Roadrunner Records. This was the record that helped the group transcend their previous thrash metal style, deepening their forays into hardcore punk, industrial music and Brazilian-styled percussion. It won silver and gold certifications throughout Europe and the USA.\n\nContents\n\n   \n   \nProduction\n\nThe band considered a number of producers, including avant-garde jazz composer John Zorn and Al Jourgensen of industrial metal pioneers Ministry. They ultimately chose Andy Wallace, who had previously mixed Arise. Sepultura wanted isolation, and for that Andy Wallace suggested Rockfield Studios, located in South Wales.\n\n&quot;Kaiowas&quot; was recorded live among the ruins of the medieval castle of Chepstow. It was an entirely acoustic track, with Andreas Kisser and Max Cavalera on the guitars and brother-drummer Igor Cavalera and bassist Paulo Jr. handling the percussion duties. When they recorded &quot;Kaiowas&quot;, the quartet never even considered playing the track live, because they thought it would be too difficult to recreate the drumming on stage. They changed their minds after seeing a video of the American band Neurosis: &quot;We saw in that live video that the Neurosis guys put down their guitars and everybody started to play the drums on stage&quot;, lead guitarist Andreas remembers. &quot;We decided to try the same thing. We rehearsed it once and it was wonderful. We haven't stopped playing the song live since.&quot;\n\nDuring Chaos A.D. recording sessions, Sepultura recorded a number of covers: &quot;The Hunt&quot;, from New Model Army, &quot;PolÃƒÂ­cia&quot;, from TitÃƒÂ£s, &quot;Inhuman Nature&quot;, from the American hardcore punk band Final Conflict, and &quot;Crucificados pelo Sistema&quot;, from Brazilian Ratos de PorÃƒÂ£o. Igor was a New Model Army fan and he convinced the other band members to include &quot;The Hunt&quot; on the record. Paulo joked that the money of the LP would go straight to new dentures for Justin Sullivan, the toothless singer of New Model Army. The latter 3 covers would be included as B-sides and also on the compilation Blood-Rooted.Reception\nB+\nNME \t(6/10)\nQ \t3/5 stars\nRolling Stone \t4/5 stars\n\nChaos A.D. received positive reviews from music critics, with many commending the album's experimentation and sense of the band coming into their own. AllMusic declared it one of the best heavy metal albums of all time, calling it &quot;a remarkable achievement not only in its concentrated power and originality, but also in the degree to which Sepultura eclipsed their idols in offering a vision of heavy metal's future.&quot; Entertainment Weekly proclaimed that &quot;Sepultura will separate casual headbangers from rabid addicts fast... even nonmetalheads will be impressed by the variety in [Chaos A.D.]: they're not averse to slowing things down.&quot;\nTrack listing\n\nAll music composed by Sepultura, except where noted.\nNo. \tTitle \tLyrics \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Refuse/Resist&quot;   \tMax Cavalera \t3:20\n2. \t&quot;Territory&quot;   \tAndreas Kisser \t4:47\n3. \t&quot;Slave New World&quot;   \tEvan Seinfeld, Max Cavalera \t2:55\n4. \t&quot;Amen&quot;   \tMax Cavalera \t4:27\n5. \t&quot;Kaiowas&quot;   \t(instrumental) \t3:43\n6. \t&quot;Propaganda&quot;   \tMax Cavalera \t3:33\n7. \t&quot;Biotech Is Godzilla&quot;   \tJello Biafra \t1:52\n8. \t&quot;Nomad&quot;   \tAndreas Kisser \t4:59\n9. \t&quot;We Who Are Not as Others&quot;   \tMax Cavalera \t3:42\n10. \t&quot;Manifest&quot;   \tMax Cavalera \t4:49\n11. \t&quot;The Hunt&quot; (New Model Army cover) \tJustin Sullivan, Robert Heaton \t3:59\n12. \t&quot;Clenched Fist&quot;   \tMax Cavalera \t4:58\n1996 reissue (American edition) \t\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\n13. \t&quot;Chaos B.C.&quot;   \t5:12\n14. \t&quot;Kaiowas (Tribal Jam)&quot;   \t3:47\n15. \t&quot;Territory (Live)&quot;   \t4:48\n16. \t&quot;Amen/Inner Self (Live)&quot;   \t8:42\n\nThe original release contained a hidden track (laughter outtakes from &quot;We Who Are Not as Others&quot;) after &quot;Clenched Fist&quot;.
