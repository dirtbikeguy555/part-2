Promotional info from the first edition - &quot;From the endlessly creative minds of comics legends Grant Morrison and Andy Kubert comes a startling new chapter in the life of Gotham's Dark Knight.\n\nThe mysterious Talia, daughter of arch villain Ra's al Ghul and Batman's one-time love, returns with a boy named Damian and claims the child is Batman's.\n\nStunned, the Dark Knight takes the child in, but the boy, raised among the brutal dictates of the League of Assassins, has his own agenda.  Soon, both Tim Drake, Bruce Wayne's newly adopted heir and Alfred, Wayne's faithful butler, find themselves targets of this genetically perfect and very angry child.\n\nIs Damian really just a misguided boy trying to prove himself to his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â€or have long years of Talia's indoctrination left him an operative solely designed to destroy Batman?\n\nUnder the masterly skills of Morrison and Kubert, BATMAN AND SON is one of the most intriguing Batman tales ever told.\n\nThis volume collects Batman #655-658 and #663-666.&quot;\n\nThis leads directly into Batman R.I.P. and the other stories in Morrison's run. \nThis is the digital copy of the new collected edition, thanks to Fawkes-Empire, and it looks gorgeous. Much thanks to the scanners; please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dddf247806ca3b6a61e1133bced13c091544c988","amp;dn":"Batman+and+Son+%28Deluxe+Edition%29+%282014%29+%28Digital%29+%28Fawkes-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dddf247806ca3b6a61e1133bced13c091544c988","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,223,36,120,6,202,59,106,97,225,19,59,206,209,60,9,21,68,201,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
