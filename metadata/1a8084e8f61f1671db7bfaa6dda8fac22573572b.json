Superb real-life photographs of instruments ranging from zithers and panpipes to electric guitars and synthesizers offer a unique &quot;eyewitness&quot; view of ancient and contemporary music. See how strings vibrate to make a note sound, how an invisible &quot;column&quot; of air sounds a pipe, which instrument resembles a peacock, how sousaphone players wear their instruments. Learn who invented an important new key system, how to master the bagpipes, why pipe organs have &quot;ears&quot; and &quot;mouths&quot;, and why French horns are &quot;doubled up&quot;. Discover how a vegetable gourd charms snakes, why tangled fingers led to the invention of the piano, why spiders add a &quot;buzz&quot; to xylophones, where reindeer toe-bones were used as whistles, and much, much more!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a8084e8f61f1671db7bfaa6dda8fac22573572b","amp;dn":"Music+%28DK+Publishing%29+%282004%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a8084e8f61f1671db7bfaa6dda8fac22573572b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,128,132,232,246,31,22,113,219,123,250,166,221,168,250,194,37,115,87,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
