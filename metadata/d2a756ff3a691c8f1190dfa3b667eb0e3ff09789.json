But when Jake wanted more, Amanda walked away. Jake immersed himself in mixed martial arts, living life on the edge. But that didn't dull the pain of Amanda's rejection - until a chance encounter throws them together. A high-powered lawyer, Amanda was a no-strings-attached kind of girl. But two years after her breakup with Jake, she still hasn't found anyone who gets her heart pumping the way he did. And then he shows up in her boardroom, hot as sin and needing help. Jake is dark, sexy, and impossible to resist. As their chemistry builds, Amanda's not sure if she can stay in control - or if she's finally willing to let him claim her, body and soul.
