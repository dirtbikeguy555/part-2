It does so by incorporating three additional \nsupporting strands of inquiry: individual decision analysis, judgmental decision making, and game theory. Each strand is introduced and used in \nanalyzing negotiations. The book starts by considering how analytically minded parties can generate joint gains and distribute them equitably by \nnegotiating with full, open, truthful exchanges. The book then examines models that disengage step by step from that ideal. It also shows how a \nneutral outsider (intervenor) can help all negotiators by providing joint, neutral analysis of their problem. Although analytical in its approach--building \nfrom simple hypothetical examples--the book can be understood by those with only a high school background in mathematics. It therefore will have a \nbroad relevance for both the theory and practice of negotiation analysis as it is applied to disputes that range from those between family members, \nbusiness partners, and business competitors to those involving labor and management, environmentalists and developers, and nations.\n\nPLZ SEED AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e481a8e26cb01e33999b287ec2847e8d8882162","amp;dn":"Negotiation+Analysis-+The+Science+and+Art+of+Collaborative+Decis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e481a8e26cb01e33999b287ec2847e8d8882162","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,72,26,142,38,203,1,227,57,153,178,135,236,40,71,232,216,136,33,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
