Hope you guuys enjo and please help seed.\n\n\n----------------\n\n\nLong, long ago, there was an ancient kingdom called Ys which prospered under the auspices of two heavenly Goddesses. Over time, the kingdom came to be known as Esteria, and its divine history was largely forgotten by all but the descendants of those who once preached the GoddessesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ will. The only reminder of this lost lore was a cursed spire at the foot of a giant crater, which locals came to regard as Ã¢â‚¬Å“The DevilÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tower.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nEventually, the men and women who called Esteria their home began mining a uniquely radiant silver from the nearby mountains, and development boomed. Towns were built, and the land became rich with life.\n\nThen, all at once, monsters began to appear. Only a few at first Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but soon enough, the land was swarming with them, and the Esterians had no choice but to hide in fear, remaining ever vigilant just to stay alive.\n\nOur story begins with a young man whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d heard rumors of these misfortunes, and strove to verify them with his own eyes; a brave swordsman with an adventurous spirit bolstered by his own youthful naivetÃƒÂ©.\n\nHis name was Adol Christin.\n\nWith no regard for his own safety, Adol set sail toward Esteria through a heretofore impassable barrier of neverending storms. There, he was destined to become ensconced within a 700 year-old mystery that would ultimately take him to a long-lost land nestled amongst the clouds...\n\nYs I &amp; II Chronicles+ is the most modernized and up-to-date remake of FalcomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classic franchise-spawning action RPGs from 1987 and 1988. Come see how the story began, and witness the birth of a legend!\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Classic buttonless Ã¢â‚¬Å“bumpÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ combat receives a full analog-enabled upgrade for gamepad users, and is augmented in Ys II by a robust magic system.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Soundtrack selectable from among the original 80s FM-synth, an early 2000s MIDI-style remix or a modern studio performance by FalcomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in-house rock band.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Character art selectable from 90s-style portraits or more modern anime designs.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢Four selectable difficulty levels and optional boss rush mode grant players a true old-school challenge.\n\n\n------------------------\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/ys_i_ii_chronicles&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/ys_i_ii_chronicles&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afdf9be224ef39f42992c273af1d8deb7eae467d","amp;dn":"YS+I+%26amp%3B+II+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afdf9be224ef39f42992c273af1d8deb7eae467d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,223,155,226,36,239,57,244,41,146,194,115,175,29,141,235,126,174,70,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
