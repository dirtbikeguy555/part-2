He was the recipient of the 1998 Nobel Prize in Literature.  The Nobel committee praised his &quot;parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony&quot;, and his &quot;modern skepticism&quot; about official truths.\n\nMore than two million copies of Saramago's books have been sold in Portugal alone and his work has been translated into 25 languages.  His works, some of which can be seen as allegories, commonly present subversive perspectives on historic events, emphasizing the human factor.  Harold Bloom described Saramago as &quot;the greatest living novelist&quot; and considered him to be &quot;a permanent part of the Western canon&quot;, while James Wood praised &quot;the distinctive tone to his fiction . . . because he narrates his novels as if he were someone both wise and ignorant.&quot;\n\nThis updated collection includes Saramago's most recently published novel in English, SKYLIGHT (2014), and several other works.\n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB format unless otherwise indicated:\n\n* ALL THE NAMES (Harcourt, 2000).
