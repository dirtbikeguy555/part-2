Consisting of Coby Dick, Jerry Horton, Dave Buckner, and Tobin Esperance, Papa Roach formed in 1993 and began releasing EPs soon after, including 1994's Potatoes for Christmas and 1995's Caca Bonita. By 1996, the group had replaced original bassist Will James with Esperance and hired a new manager; the following year, Papa Roach released their first full-length album, Old Friends from Young Years, which became a surprise hit on local radio.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nLabel:\t\t\tGeffen\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Broken Home\n02.Last Resort\n03.Time And Time Again\n04.She Loves Me Not\n05.Scars\n06.Getting Away With Murder\n07.Just Go (Never Look Back)\n08.To Be Loved\n09.Reckless\n10.Had Enough (Acoustic)\n11.Forever (Live)\n12.Hollywood Whore\n13.Lifeline\n14.Scars (Acoustic)\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                    ****Please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3bc5b6188b1b10b8de57c3770727395a2948bfc","amp;dn":"Papa+Roach+-+The+Best+Of+Papa+Roach+Loved+%282010%29+mp3+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3bc5b6188b1b10b8de57c3770727395a2948bfc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,188,91,97,136,177,177,11,141,229,124,55,112,114,115,149,162,148,139,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
