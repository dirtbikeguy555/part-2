He grew up making and breaking beats. He founded his own label, Solesides, in college. He began releasing the Hip-Hop Reconstruction mix tapes in 1991. And with the critically-acclaimed Ã¢â‚¬Å“Endtroducing...Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he showed the world what was possible with sound, releasing the first album recorded purely from samples. Since then, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s toured the world, released three full-length albums and worked on countless collaborative projects with artists from Blackalicious and Q-Tip to Cut Chemist and Thom Yorke.\n\nDJ Shadow - Hidden Transmissions Photo Vault\n\nA few more.jpg\nAnd more.....jpg\nAt Work.jpg\nChillin.jpg\nEven More Records.jpg\nIn The Lab.jpg\nMore Records.jpg\nRecords.jpg\n\nDJ Shadow - Hidden Transmissions\n\nAffectations.mp3\nAffectations.wav\nDreams Of A Piece.mp3\nDreams Of A Piece.wav\nTotal Breakdown (Gab Demo 2).mp3\nTotal Breakdown (Gab Demo 2).wav\nHome Studio Footage 1995.mkv\nHome Studio Footage 1995.mp4\nTime Capsule.pdf\nRealPlayer_B.exe\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://djshadow.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://djshadow.com&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f463bfded35ef84c06b5d51df51856076b97059b","amp;dn":"DJ+Shadow+-+Hidden+Transmissions+Bundle+BitTorrent+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f463bfded35ef84c06b5d51df51856076b97059b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,99,191,222,211,94,248,76,6,181,213,29,245,24,86,7,107,151,5,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
