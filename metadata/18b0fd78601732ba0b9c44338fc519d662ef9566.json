Synthesizers are by no means absent on Weatherhouse Ã¢â‚¬â€ an electronic pulse is among the first sounds heard on the album Ã¢â‚¬â€ but they are not prominent. They, like so much else on this handsome record, function as a colorful thread in an intricately woven tapestry. Where there's often a steely glint in the master plan of Thom Yorke (the near simultaneous release of Tomorrow's Modern Boxes makes comparisons hard to avoid), Selway prefers a small-scale intimacy. His voice Ã¢â‚¬â€ often murmuring, never soaring Ã¢â‚¬â€ has an inherent conversational warmth that sometimes distracts from the sly complexities of his compositions. Then again, the charm of Weatherhouse is that it's unassuming: he's tapping into the gentle ebb and flow of classic English art rock but he's sensible enough to never succumb to the ostentatious display of brains that sometimes plagues classic prog. This is an immaculately crafted, impossibly tasteful miniature, one that will satisfy any listener longing for a Radiohead stripped of future shock.\n\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;   B i o g r a p h y\n\nPhilip Selway followed in the footsteps of Radiohead bandmates Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood by releasing a solo album, Familial, in 2010. Previously known for his drumming, drum programming, and occasional background vocals, Selway slipped easily into songwriting mode while also switching to guitar. The groundwork for his solo album came with his participation in Neil Finn's 2001 all-star concerts, dubbed 7 Worlds Collide. 7 Worlds Collide later took the shape of a group and released an album, The Sun Came Out, in 2009. In addition to playing percussion and acoustic guitar, Selway provided a pair of hushed, folk-tinged songs Ã¢â‚¬â€ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Ties That Bind UsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Witching HourÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ and sang lead on them. Re-recordings of these two songs formed the basis of Familial. The album involved assistance from 7 Worlds Collide associates Lisa Germano, Soul Coughing's Sebastian Steinberg, and WilcoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Glenn Kotche and Jeff Tweedy. It was released in August 2010 through Bella Union in the U.K. and Nonesuch in the U.S. Selway's sophomore effort Weatherhouse followed in 2014. More complex and involving than his mostly acoustic debut, with a broader instrumental palette, it had something of the feel of latter-day Radiohead or Yorke's solo work but with an uncategorizable '80s/'90s melodic twist.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18b0fd78601732ba0b9c44338fc519d662ef9566","amp;dn":"Philip+Selway+-+%5B2014%5D+-+Weatherhouse","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18b0fd78601732ba0b9c44338fc519d662ef9566","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,176,253,120,96,23,50,186,11,156,68,51,143,197,25,214,98,239,149,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
