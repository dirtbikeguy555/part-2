Given the importance and the urgency of the topic, we must all read it and follow in their footsteps.&quot;\r\nâ€”Ayaan Hirsi Ali\r\n\r\nIn this short book, Sam Harris and Maajid Nawaz invite you to join an urgently needed conversation: Is Islam a religion of peace or war? Is it amenable to reform? Why do so many Muslims seem drawn to extremism? What do words like Islamism, jihadism, and fundamentalism mean in todayâ€™s world?\r\n\r\nRemarkable for the breadth and depth of its analysis, this dialogue between a famous atheist and a former radical is all the more startling for its decorum. Harris and Nawaz have produced something genuinely new: they engage one of the most polarizing issues of our timeâ€•fearlessly and fullyâ€•and actually make progress.
