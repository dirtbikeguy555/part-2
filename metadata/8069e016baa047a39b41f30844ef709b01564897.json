Its one of the best emulators for NDS games like Pokemon HeartGold, Soulsilver, Pokemon Black &amp; White, Pokemon Ranger and many more. I will soon upload the NDS games of Pokemon and others which are playable in DeSmuME. So, have patience my friends.\n\n            Playing any game in DeSmuME is pretty easy, so I will not go into that. What's different here from the Visual Boy Advance (GBA games) is that DeSmuME and all other NDS emulators have a touchscreen feature, which is of course playable by your mouse. And, secondly, its graphics are far better than the GBA roms that you all have been playing.\n\n            So, enjoy this fine emulator and yes, NDS games are on their way... &gt;&gt;\n\nPlease Seed(very small file though)...&gt;&gt;\n\nEnjoy...:)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8069e016baa047a39b41f30844ef709b01564897","amp;dn":"DeSmuME+NDS+emulator+%28ver.+0.9.7%29+for+PC+%5Bimsourav%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8069e016baa047a39b41f30844ef709b01564897","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,105,224,22,186,160,71,163,155,65,243,8,68,239,112,155,1,86,72,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
