Marcel OphÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ls mixes archival footage with 1969 interviews of a German officer and of collaborators and resistance fighters from Clermont-Ferrand. They comment on the nature, details and reasons for the collaboration, from anti-Semitism, xenophobia, and fear of Bolsheviks, to simple caution. Part one, &quot;The Collapse,&quot; includes an extended interview with Pierre MendÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨s-France, jailed for anti-Vichy action and later France's Prime Minister. At the heart of part two, &quot;The Choice,&quot; is an interview with Christian de la MaziÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re, one of 7,000 French youth to fight on the eastern front wearing German uniforms.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c730b8275660304b3439de29024665328cccd458","amp;dn":"The+Sorrow+and+the+Pity+%28Le+chagrin+et+la+piti%C3%83%C2%A9%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c730b8275660304b3439de29024665328cccd458","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,48,184,39,86,96,48,75,52,57,222,41,2,70,101,50,140,204,212,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
