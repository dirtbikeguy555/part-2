Simply place the Control Point on the area that you want to edit and U Point Technology will analyze color elements such as hue, saturation and brightness, as well as recognize similar areas where an edit would best be applied. This technology powers the entire Capture NX 2 series of Control Points: Color Control Points, the all-new Selection Control Points, White/Black/Neutral Control Points and Red-Eye Control Points. With Capture NX 2, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no need to deal with selection tools, layers or lengthy training.\n\nKey Features\nColor Control Point:\nEnhancements for hue, brightness and saturation are as simple as placing a Color Control Point on your image, then adjusting the length of the sliders. For example, Color Control Points are remarkably convenient for changing the color of flowers to better effect against green surrounding foliage.\n\nSelection Control Point:\nThis new function enables you to apply enhancements such as Unsharp Mask or D-Lighting to a specific area with just a click of the mouse. There is no need for precision selection or masks Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the Selection Control Point recognizes the areas you want to modify. The enhancement effect can easily be adjusted, allowing you to apply your chosen effect as you would with intuitive masking.\nD-Lighting brightens the shadow areas, and Selection Control Point applies the effect only to the bright subjects and their surroundings seen through the opening between foliage and water.\nTone Curve adjusts the brightness and contrast, and Selection Control Point applies the effect only to the man and his surroundings.\n\nAuto Retouch Brush:\nTo simply achieve more natural-looking results, Auto Retouch Brush lets you remove dust spots on an image using a mouse click and stroke to match the surrounding color and tones. This can also be used to remove facial blemishes, imperfections on flowers, or other unwanted objects within the frame.\n\nShadow/Highlight Adjustments:\nUsing the slider at [Quick Fix], you can adjust shadows by [Shadow Adjust] and blown out highlights by [Highlight Adjust].\n\nWorkspaces:\nFour workspaces are provided: Browser, Metadata, Multi-Purpose and Edit, and your window composition can be easily switched among them.\n\nQuick Fix:\nA combination of frequently used tools including [Level and Tone Curve], [Exposure Compensation], [Contrast], [Highlight Protection], [Shadow Protection] and [Saturation] in a single window.\n\nSimultaneous opening of multiple settings:\nYou can open multiple image processing settings at the same time and make parallel process adjustments of multiple details.\n\nLabel/Rating support (XMP):\nSupports nine kinds of labeling and five levels of ratings according to XMP, a metadata industry standard.\n\nFunctions to help you realize your desired results:\nStraighten, Black/White Control Points, Neutral Control Points, Red-Eye Control Points, Selection Tools, Batch Processing, 16-bit Image Compatible, Vignette Control*, Auto Color Aberration Control*, Distortion Control Function*, Noise Reduction, Active D-Lighting (NEF only), D-Lighting, LCH Editor, Image Dust Off (NEF only), Fisheye Image Transformation, Color Booster Function, Color Management, Highlight/Shadow Display, Picture Control Compatibility (NEF only)\n*Can be applied to images captured by Nikon SLR cameras with a D/G type lens.\n\nOS - MacOSX Version 10.4.11, 10.5.2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70baba1685026280bf5aff867df3e777dc1dabf9","amp;dn":"Nikon+Capture+NX+2.4.7+%2B+Camera+Control+Pro+2.17%28Mac+OSX%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70baba1685026280bf5aff867df3e777dc1dabf9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,186,186,22,133,2,98,128,191,90,255,134,125,243,231,119,220,29,171,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
