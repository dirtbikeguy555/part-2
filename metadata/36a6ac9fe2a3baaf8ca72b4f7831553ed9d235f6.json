All the finishing touches of fashion - the gloves, hats, shoes, bags, canes - are drawn with a wealth of detail: not only individually, but also on figures to show how they were worn. The author describes the fabrics and colours used and discusses the origins and influences of the garments. Divided into easy-to-fmd chronological periods, the book also has a glossary and extensive bibliography","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36a6ac9fe2a3baaf8ca72b4f7831553ed9d235f6","amp;dn":"Fashion+Accessories+-+Since+1500+%28History+Arts%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36a6ac9fe2a3baaf8ca72b4f7831553ed9d235f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,166,172,159,226,163,186,175,140,167,43,79,120,49,85,62,217,210,53,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
