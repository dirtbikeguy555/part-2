High-frequency trading is the subject of extensive debate, particularly as to whether it is beneficial for traders and markets or instead allows some traders to benefit at others expense. This book provides you with an important overview and perspective on this area, with a particular focus on how low-frequency traders and asset managers can survive in the high frequency world.\n\nWith chapters written by the leading practitioners and academics in the area the book will show you how issues such as big data come into play, how high-frequency should affect optimal execution algorithms and how markets inter-connect in new ways that affect volatility and market stability. Contributors also discuss the new regulatory challenges that arise in the high frequency world.\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPreface\nDavid Easley, Marcos M. Lopez de Prado, Maureen OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Hara\n\n1.
