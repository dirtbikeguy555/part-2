Released for the PlayStation 2 game console on October 14, 2003 in North America, October 17, 2003 in Europe and March 11, 2004 in Japan, the game is the sequel to Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy and the second game in the Jak and Daxter series.\n\nThe game features new weapons and devices, new playable areas, and a storyline that picks up after the events of The Precursor Legacy. The game's plot is much darker than its predecessor's, set in Haven City, a dystopia ruled under the questionable fist of Baron Praxis, who is engaged in a war against a techno-organic group of organisms known as the &quot;Metal Heads&quot;. As in the previous game, the player takes on the dual role of recurring protagonists Jak and Daxter. There are also a new array of characters such as Torn, Erol, Krew, Kor, Ashelin, and Sig, as well as some returning ones, such as Samos and Keira. Jak II is both a sequel and prequel to the first game.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da0829da80e69c82e86e4acf95edb78ea99bf0d3","amp;dn":"Jak+II","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da0829da80e69c82e86e4acf95edb78ea99bf0d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,8,41,218,128,230,156,130,232,110,74,207,149,237,183,142,169,155,240,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
