Sims - Bass\n\nDescription from Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jesus_Lizard)\n\nThe Jesus Lizard is an alternative rock band formed in 1987 in Austin, Texas, and based in Chicago, Illinois from 1989 to 1999...\n\nTheir music was a scathing mix of piercing guitar, machine-like drums, propulsive bass guitar, and psychotic vocals. Denison's stinging guitar often served more as texture or coloring than as a melody instrument, while the rhythm section's stops and starts were simultaneously precise and brutal. David Yow's frenzied, often incoherent vocals were unique, unlike anything past or present. David Sprague suggests that &quot;Yow's disjointed couplets&quot; are reminiscent of a &quot;preacher speaking in tongues&quot;...\n\nThe Jesus Lizard scheduled a number of shows in 2009 with their original line-up, including appearances at the Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago, and All Tomorrow's Parties music festivals in England, and New York including headlining show in London and on Pukkelpop in Belgium. They also headlined the Capitol Hill Block Party in Seattle on July 24, 2009.\n\nOn October 6, 2009, all of the band's Touch and Go studio albums were re-released with improved sound and bonus tracks. All the albums were remastered by Bob Weston and Steve Albini and have new liner notes and gatefold artwork.\n\nAlbums in this torrent:\n\n1991 - Goat (320 kbps)\n1991 - Head &amp; Pure (320 kbps)\n1992 - Liar (320 kbps)\n1992 - Peel Session (1991-1992) (224 kbps)\n1993 - Lash (320 kbps)\n1993 - Split with Nirvana (320 kbps)\n1994 - Down (320 kbps)\n1994 - Show (320 kbps)\n1996 - Shot (320 kbps)\n1997 - S/T 10'' EP (320 kbps)\n1998 - Blue (320 kbps)\n2000 - Bang (192 kbps)\n\nThanks to the original uploaders! \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jesus_Lizard&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jesus_Lizard&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAll references to the music, placed above, are presented only for fact-finding listening .. so if you like it - buy it !\n\nAlways Support The Artists And Buy The Original Material And Erase Downloaded Files in 24 hours or less, The Albums Are Not My Uploads...\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cb8fd18cf39cb50ce62a81fefff74f5b1fc589c","amp;dn":"The+Jesus+Lizard+-+Discography+%281991-2000%29+%5Bmp3%40192-320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cb8fd18cf39cb50ce62a81fefff74f5b1fc589c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,184,253,24,207,57,203,80,206,98,168,31,239,255,116,245,177,252,88,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
