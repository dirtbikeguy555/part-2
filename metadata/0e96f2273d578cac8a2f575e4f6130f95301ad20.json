Audio Stream 2 available to those that also wish to experience great 5.1 sound that goes right alongside great picture quality.\n\nFor those experiencing LOW VOLUME issues, try to playback the 2nd Audio stream in stereo mode, this should improve audio quality and increase the volume substantially.\n\nIf you wish to experience 5.1 audio on the original PS3 or Newer PS3, Just select the audio options and ensure the 5.1 stream/track is selected.\n\nNOTE: PS3 Users and PC Users using HDMI should ensure their audio mode configuration in the PS3/Sound Options for the device is set to have LPCM enabled/Checked for 6 channel output (or more). Otherwise PS3 or PC Users will not be able to experience 5.1 audio as you cannot bitstream AAC5.1 for 99% of the products.\n\nPC Users will have to use something like VLC that allows you to choose the 2nd Audio stream/track, Depending on your configuration, vlc should automatically enable 5.1 playback after the track change, but double check by selecting AUDIO ~ Audio Device ~ 5.1\n\n\nScreenshot Previews:\n                   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img823/1016/lm9j.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img823/1016/lm9j.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img716/158/ekhg.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img716/158/ekhg.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img209/2590/mojg.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img209/2590/mojg.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img109/7978/chb1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img109/7978/chb1.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img4/3940/fgp8.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img4/3940/fgp8.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img407/1058/dvuj.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img407/1058/dvuj.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img196/5078/c31g.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img196/5078/c31g.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img580/3503/wrev.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img580/3503/wrev.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img850/3457/a83.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img850/3457/a83.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img842/836/kvz9.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img842/836/kvz9.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPlease, be patient with seeding...\n\nEnjoy ;)\n\nFeel free to leave a + vote and a comment, Thank You!\n\n\nJudas's Note:\n\nI've lots of blurays... lots, I know what looks phenomenal on bluray and what doesn't. There aren't many movies that look quite as bad as The Hurt Locker, it's really VERY disappointing. So this doesn't make encoding it anywhere near being remotely a &quot;pleasure&quot; because it frankly just looks fuzzy all the time, and ultra grainy. There is a non-stop amount of judder/movement for the film on bluray, this doesn't exactly make encoding easy at all to begin with, but the image quality on bluray was just terrible too. Looks like they filmed it with a potatoe and then upscaled it to 1080p. Either way, don't be surprised if you think it looks terrible. I even encoded it 3 times with various settings just to see if I could improve something somewhere, but in the end, I just had to suck it up. I wasn't even going to bother uploading it, but I've had numerous requests for it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e96f2273d578cac8a2f575e4f6130f95301ad20","amp;dn":"The+Hurt+Locker+%282008%29+1080p+5.1+BrRip+x264+-+Judas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e96f2273d578cac8a2f575e4f6130f95301ad20","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,150,242,39,61,87,140,172,138,47,87,94,79,97,48,249,83,1,173,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
