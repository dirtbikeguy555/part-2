Not sure why it wasn't showing up properly before, but it seems to be fine now]\n\nThese aren't HD or anything fancy.\nAll episodes were collected right here from TPB.\n\nThe reason I've re-upped is because I've cleaned filenames, metadata tags, and done volume levelling across all files.  I had to convert some that were mp4 format into avi for consistency and to help with volume-levelling.\n\nI'll bet you can find higher-resolution rips if you dig, but I can pretty much promise you these will be much better organized and much less of a hassle to sort through.\n\nI recommend VLC for viewing.\nIf you insist on using WMP, make sure you get the K-Lite Media Codec packs first.\nK-Lite is freeware and it's basically an essential part of any video lover's toolkit.\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84f11f503078a7e6f890fec470685ff477b63b8f","amp;dn":"Top+Gear+US+-+Season+3+%28FIXED%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84f11f503078a7e6f890fec470685ff477b63b8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,241,31,80,48,120,167,230,248,144,254,196,112,104,95,244,119,182,59,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
