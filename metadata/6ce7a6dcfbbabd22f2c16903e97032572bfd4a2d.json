It would be an impossible mission: with the art trapped behind enemy lines, and with the German army under orders to destroy everything as the Reich fell, how could these guys - seven museum directors, curators, and art historians, all more familiar with Michelangelo than the M-1 - possibly hope to succeed? But as the Monuments Men, as they were called, found themselves in a race against time to avoid the destruction of 1000 years of culture, they would risk their lives to protect and defend mankind's greatest achievements. From director George Clooney, the film stars George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Bob Balaban, Hugh Bonneville, and Cate Blanchett. The screenplay is by George Clooney &amp; Grant Heslov, based on the book by Robert M. Edsel with Bret Witter. Produced by Grant Heslov and George Clooney.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ce7a6dcfbbabd22f2c16903e97032572bfd4a2d","amp;dn":"The.Monuments.Men.2014.TS.x264.AC3-P2P","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ce7a6dcfbbabd22f2c16903e97032572bfd4a2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,231,166,220,251,186,189,34,242,193,105,3,233,112,50,87,43,253,74,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
