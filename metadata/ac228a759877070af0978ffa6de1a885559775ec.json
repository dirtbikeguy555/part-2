He brings to his treatment of these questions the same courage, scrupulous logic, and lofty wisdom for which his other work as philosopher, writer, and teacher has been famous. These qualities make the essays included in this book perhaps the most graceful and moving presentation of the freethinker's position since the days of Hume and Voltaire.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I am as firmly convinced that religions do harm as I am that they are untrue,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Russell declares in his Preface, and his reasoned opposition to any system or dogma which he feels may shackle manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mind runs through all the essays in this book, whether they were written as early as 1899 or as late as 1954.\n\nThe book has been edited, with Lord RussellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s full approval and cooperation, by Professor Paul Edwards of the Philosophy Department of New York University. In an Appendix, Professor Edwards contributes a full account of the highly controversial Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bertrand Russell CaseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of 1940, in which Russell was judicially declared Ã¢â‚¬Å“unfitÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to teach philosophy at the College of the City of New York.\n\nWhether the reader shares or rejects Bertrand RussellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s views, he will find this book an invigorating challenge to set notions, a masterly statement of a philosophical position, and a pure joy to read.'\n\nReviews:\n'The most robust as well as the most witty infidel since Voltaire and he can not fail to sharpen men's sense of what is entailed both in belief and unbelief.' - The Spectator\n\n'What makes the book valuable is life-long uncompromising intellectual honesty.' - Times Literary Supplement\n\nThis torrent contains the original fully browseable and searchable PD copy of the 2004 version as well as a readable EPUB version that was made in Calibre.
