As the New Republic fights to restore a lasting peace to the galaxy, some dare to imagine new beginnings and new destinies. For Han Solo, that means settling his last outstanding debt, by helping Chewbacca liberate the Wookieeâ€™s homeworld of Kashyyyk.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Norra Wexley and her band of Imperial hunters pursue Grand Admiral Rae Sloane and the Empireâ€™s remaining leadership across the galaxy. Even as more and more officers are brought to justice, Sloane continues to elude the New Republic, and Norra fears Sloane may be searching for a means to save the crumbling Empire from oblivion. But the hunt for Sloane is cut short when Norra receives an urgent request from Princess Leia Organa. The attempt to liberate Kashyyyk has carried Han Solo, Chewbacca, and a band of smugglers into an ambushâ€”resulting in Chewieâ€™s capture and Hanâ€™s disappearance.\r\n\r\nBreaking away from their official mission and racing toward the Millennium Falconâ€™s last known location, Norra and her crew prepare for any challenge that stands between them and their missing comrades. But they canâ€™t anticipate the true depth of the danger that awaits themâ€”or the ruthlessness of the enemy drawing them into his crosshairs","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a04eb7cc5ee26f2a29071198904041d9c8193e99","amp;dn":"Chuck+Wendig+-+Life+Debt+%28Star+Wars%3A+The+Aftermath+Trilogy+%232%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a04eb7cc5ee26f2a29071198904041d9c8193e99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,78,183,204,94,226,111,42,41,7,17,152,144,64,65,217,200,25,62,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
