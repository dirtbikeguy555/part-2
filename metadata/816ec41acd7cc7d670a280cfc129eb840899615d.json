If you are using VLC to watch TV on your PC then this app is for you. This is the paid version of IPTV app.Sometimes m3u files on Android could be deleted by the system. This happens because Android scans sd-card, reads m3u playlists and fixes them by deleting the links to files which could not be found on your sd-card. Since you have URLs instead of files in your playlist, Android thinks that playlist is empty and deletes it. To avoid this just create some folder, place there empty â€œ.nomediaâ€ file and your m3u playlist. After that Android will exclude that folder from scanning and wonâ€™t touch the playlist.Alternatively, you can place your playlist to some web server (Dropbox public link is one of the options) and specify its URL in the app.\r\n\r\nAd free\r\nAbility to auto-reconnect to streaming server when connection is closed unexpectedly (http streams only).\r\nStart app on device boot option, useful for set-top boxes.\r\nExtended playlists history\r\nKey Features\r\n\r\nM3U and XSPF playlists support\r\nPlaylists history\r\nPlaying multicast streams with UDP proxy (proxy need to be installed in your LAN)\r\nAbility to auto-reconnect to streaming server when connection is closed unexpectedly (http streams only)\r\nGrid or list view of TV channels\r\nEPG support in XMLTV and JTV formats\r\nStart app on device boot option","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:816ec41acd7cc7d670a280cfc129eb840899615d","amp;dn":"IPTV+Pro+v3.4+Cracked","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"816ec41acd7cc7d670a280cfc129eb840899615d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,110,196,26,205,124,199,214,112,162,128,207,193,41,235,132,8,153,97,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
