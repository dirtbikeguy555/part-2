The other release had hardcodded english subs. This is the source DVD.\n\n&quot;Lars von TrierÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s direction makes this film a shocking look into the disturbed mind of a woman who has been scorned and left. MedeaÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s revenge is horrible but never unbelievable. She does what every sane person would do, when deprived of all that she loves. The film burns itself into your mind and leaves you with a lasting impression of what human misery can be like.&quot;\n\n\n&quot;Wow, this is an inspired film. It takes the myth of Jason written by Euripedes and a script by Carl Th. Dreyer, boths testimony has been proved by the test of time and makes a fantastic low budget masterpiece epic of it. Some people think that its production values spoils the experience, but I would like to ask them this: would Claude Monets paintings look better if they were polished? We see into the fabric of film here and I think that only heightens the realism or it makes me believe it the more as a film, if the focus was on making it look real several other things would get lost.&quot;\n\n\n\nFor anyone curious about the film&amp;#039;s unique visual texture, Medea was shot on video, projected and re-shot on film, and then transferred back to tape again (with the colour being treated and manipulated at each stage).  This was, in Trier&amp;#039;s words, &quot;to get away from that video look, which I wasn&amp;#039;t keen on&quot;.  A similar, albeit more refined, process was subsequently used for The Kingdom (Riget).\n\nIf anyone want to see Screenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i285.photobucket.com/albums/ll68/cainc5/bscap027.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i285.photobucket.com/albums/ll68/cainc5/bscap027.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i285.photobucket.com/albums/ll68/cainc5/bscap023.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i285.photobucket.com/albums/ll68/cainc5/bscap023.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i285.photobucket.com/albums/ll68/cainc5/bscap024.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i285.photobucket.com/albums/ll68/cainc5/bscap024.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i285.photobucket.com/albums/ll68/cainc5/bscap028.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i285.photobucket.com/albums/ll68/cainc5/bscap028.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i285.photobucket.com/albums/ll68/cainc5/bscap025.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i285.photobucket.com/albums/ll68/cainc5/bscap025.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i285.photobucket.com/albums/ll68/cainc5/bscap026.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i285.photobucket.com/albums/ll68/cainc5/bscap026.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRip Specs:\nRipped using AutoGK 2.45\n\nVIDEO_BITRATE 1170\nVIDEO_CODEC_NAME XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVIDEO_DAR 1.333\nVIDEO_DURATION 1:16:01\nVIDEO_FRAME_COUNT 114007\nVIDEO_FRAMES_PER_SEC 25.000\nVIDEO_MPEG4 MPEG-4\nVIDEO_QF 0.152\nVIDEO_SAR 1.333\nVIDEO_SIZE_X 640\nVIDEO_SIZE_Y 480\nAUDIO_BITRATE 103\nAUDIO_BITRATE_TYPE VBR\nAUDIO_CHANNEL_COUNT 2\nAUDIO_CODEC 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAUDIO_SAMPLE_RATE 48000","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27001522237898bccf16d9dedb51bdcc956abc67","amp;dn":"Medea_1988_Lars_Von_Trier_DVDRip_XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27001522237898bccf16d9dedb51bdcc956abc67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,0,21,34,35,120,152,188,207,22,217,222,219,81,189,204,149,106,188,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
