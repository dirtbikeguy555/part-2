The answer springs directly from the fact that it is very rare to find a book that covers modeling with all types of differential equations in one volume. Until now. Mathematical Modeling: Models, Analysis and Applications covers modeling with all kinds of differential equations, namely ordinary, partial, delay, and stochastic. The book also contains a chapter on discrete modeling, consisting of differential equations, making it a complete textbook on this important skill needed for the study of science, engineering, and social sciences.\n\nMore than just a textbook, this how-to guide presents tools for mathematical modeling and analysis. It offers a wide-ranging overview of mathematical ideas and techniques that provide a number of effective approaches to problem solving. Topics covered include spatial, delayed, and stochastic modeling. The text provides real-life examples of discrete and continuous mathematical modeling scenarios. MATLABÃ‚Â® and MathematicaÃ‚Â® are incorporated throughout the text. The examples and exercises in each chapter can be used as problems in a project.\n\nSince mathematical modeling involves a diverse range of skills and tools, the author focuses on techniques that will be of particular interest to engineers, scientists, and others who use models of discrete and continuous systems. He gives students a foundation for understanding and using the mathematics that is the basis of computers, and therefore a foundation for success in engineering and science streams. \n\nProduct Details:\n\nPDF: 276 pages\nPublisher: Chapman and Hall/CRC; 1 edition (February 7, 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1439854513\nISBN-13: 978-1439854518\nAmazon Link:\n\nContent Details:\n\nimage\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4e49d02db3daf2e02b57f2f0b247758c685acd8","amp;dn":"Mathematical+Modeling%3A+Models%2C+Analysis+and+Applications+%282014%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4e49d02db3daf2e02b57f2f0b247758c685acd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,228,157,2,219,61,175,46,2,181,127,47,11,36,119,88,198,133,172,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
