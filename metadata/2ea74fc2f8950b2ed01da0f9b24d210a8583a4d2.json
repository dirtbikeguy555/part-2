It portrays what happened before and after a botched jewel heist, but not the heist itself. Reservoir Dogs stars an ensemble cast with Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Steve Buscemi and Lawrence Tierney. Tarantino also has a minor role, as does criminal-turned-author Eddie Bunker. It incorporates many themes and aesthetics that have become Tarantino's hallmarks: violent crime, pop culture references, memorable dialogue with excessive profanity and a nonlinear storyline.\n\nThe film has become a classic of independent film and was named &quot;Greatest Independent Film of all Time&quot; by Empire. Reservoir Dogs was generally well received and the cast was praised by many critics, though it never became a major box office success, becoming mostly popular after the success of Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. It is also often criticized for its amount of violence, and audience members reportedly walked out during the &quot;ear-cutting scene&quot;.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105236/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105236/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDirected by Quentin Tarantino \nProduced by Lawrence Bender \nWritten by Quentin Tarantino \nStarring Harvey Keitel Tim Roth Steve Buscemi Chris Penn Michael Madsen Lawrence Tierney \nCinematography Andrzej Sekula \nEditing by Sally Menke \nDistributed by Miramax Films\nCarolco Pictures\nRank Film Distributors\nMomentum Pictures (UK) \nRelease date(s) October 23, 1992 \nRunning time 99 min. \nCountry USA \nLanguage English \nBudget US$1.2 million\n\nLength.......................: 01h 39m 07s \n\n[Video]\nFormat.......................: NTSC\nResolution...................: 624 x 352\nCodec........................: XviD, 2 Pass mode\nBitrate......................: Avg. 838 kBit/s\nFormat.......................: MP3\nChannels.....................: 2 Channels (Surround Stereo)\nSampleRate...................: 48000 Hz\nBitrate......................: 128 kBit/s\n\nEkolb.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ea74fc2f8950b2ed01da0f9b24d210a8583a4d2","amp;dn":"Reservoir+Dogs+%281992%29+%5BDVDrip+%28XviD%29%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ea74fc2f8950b2ed01da0f9b24d210a8583a4d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,167,79,194,248,149,11,46,208,29,160,249,178,77,33,10,133,131,164,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
