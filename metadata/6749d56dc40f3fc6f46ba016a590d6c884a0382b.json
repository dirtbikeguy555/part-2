In Robert A. Heinleinâ€™s Double Star (1956), an actor forced to impersonate a twenty-second-century political leader intent on forging bonds between Earthlings and Martians learns hard lessons about the nature of power. Alfred Besterâ€™s The Stars My Destination (1956), which Neil Gaiman has called â€œthe perfect cyberpunk novel,â€ is a classic revenge tale set in a nightmarish future dominated by corporations.\r\n\r\nIn James Blishâ€™s A Case of Conscience (1958), space voyagers on the remote planet Lithia find themselves challenged by the values of an alien civilization. Algis Budrysâ€™s Who? (1958) unleashes Cold War anxieties about technology and human identity with its story of a scientist rebuilt beyond recognition after a devastating accident. Set in â€œthe Place,â€ a bar and bordello in the backwater of timeâ€™s stream, Fritz Leiberâ€™s The Big Time (1958) explores the implications of the â€œChange War,â€ an endless cosmic struggle in which shadowy antagonists dart in and out of history in a contest to control destiny.\r\n\r\nThe range of stylesâ€”by turns adventurous, satiric, incisiveâ€”is as varied as the themes addressed by these novels, all now acknowledged as American classics. Together they mark an explosively entertaining era in modern fiction.\r\n\r\nGary K. Wolfe, editor, is Professor of Humanities in Roosevelt Universityâ€™s Evelyn T. Stone College of Professional Studies and the author, most recently, of Evaporating Genres: Essays on Fantastic Literature and Sightings: Reviews 2002â€“2006","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6749d56dc40f3fc6f46ba016a590d6c884a0382b","amp;dn":"American+Science+Fiction%2C+Vol+2+-+Gary+K.+Wolfe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6749d56dc40f3fc6f46ba016a590d6c884a0382b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,73,213,109,196,15,63,198,244,107,160,22,165,144,214,200,132,160,56,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
