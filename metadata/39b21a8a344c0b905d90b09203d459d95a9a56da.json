It is made up of four sections:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The First StoryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is an introduction to Skyward Sword and its world.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A Complete History of HyruleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is the second section which gives the Zelda community the most sought-out information on the timeline and the tiny details such as HyliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bloodline and the diminishing of the Hylian race. It follows the order of events of the series chronologically.\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Creative TracesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ holds a great amount of official and concept artwork along with various sketches.\nThe fourth section holds the Skyward Sword manga by Akira Himekawa, the leading author in charge of creating the manga of the Zelda series.\nThough Hyrule Historia provided the fans with an official timeline, the creators mention that various details had to be overlooked and that fans should just enjoy the series and the new timeline. It is said that the order of events and the details within the timeline change according to who is weaving the tales, and additionally, history is still being spun. Therefore, it may be safe to assume that, years down the road, various aspects of Hyrule Historia may become obsolete as new information could take its place.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39b21a8a344c0b905d90b09203d459d95a9a56da","amp;dn":"The+legend+of+zelda+Hyrule+Historia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39b21a8a344c0b905d90b09203d459d95a9a56da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,178,26,138,52,76,11,144,93,144,176,146,3,212,89,217,90,154,86,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
