Starting with geometric shapes, you'll learn to work with elements that form the basis of almost any drawing project, and then learn how to use fills, strokes and gradients to incorporate more complexity into your projects. The Illustrator lessons show you how to work with text, transform objects, manipulate layers, utilize brush and pen tools, and modify your compositions through warping, meshes, masks and more. Andy covers 3D, animation, file conversion and printing, too.\n\nBy the completion of this computer software training course, you will be completely competent in the use of Illustrator, creating your own masterpieces of vector art.
