It had to come to terms with psychedelia, face punk head on and find huge sums of money to feed the excesses of the 1980s. \r\nInterviews with EMI artists including members of Queen, Pink Floyd, the Sex Pistols and Pet Shop Boys reveal how their demands for more and more control ultimately led to drastic changes at EMI. Former EMI employees share the gossip and goings-on in an industry infamous for its extravagance. \r\nThe British music industry is world renowned. It has produced decades of memorable music that has reached all corners of the globe. EMI has always been at the forefront and has left an indelible mark on our culture forever.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b8/EMI-The-Inside-Story-Screen0.jpg\r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3e/EMI-The-Inside-Story-Screen1.jpg\r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f2/EMI-The-Inside-Story-Screen2.jpg\r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d7/EMI-The-Inside-Story-Screen3.jpg\r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/bb/EMI-The-Inside-Story-Screen4.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/01/EMI-The-Inside-Story-Screen5.jpg\r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/74/EMI-The-Inside-Story-Screen6.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0b/EMI-The-Inside-Story-Screen7.jpg\r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7e/EMI-The-Inside-Story-Screen8.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d5/EMI-The-Inside-Story-Screen9.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/ba/EMI-The-Inside-Story-Screen10.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/dd/EMI-The-Inside-Story-Screen11.jpg\r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/92/EMI-The-Inside-Story-Screen12.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7b/EMI-The-Inside-Story-Screen13.jpg\r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/ba/EMI-The-Inside-Story-Screen14.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8e/EMI-The-Inside-Story-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video: Bitrate: CRF-21 (~3554 Kbps)\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins,\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.53 GB\r\n * Source: HDrip\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \r\n * http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07c6fj7","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f7cdf7c143bf730e570f82daf8de015646819d0","amp;dn":"BBC.EMI.The.Inside.Story.720p.HDTV.x264.AAC.MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f7cdf7c143bf730e570f82daf8de015646819d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,124,223,124,20,59,247,48,229,112,248,45,175,141,224,21,100,104,25,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
