Superhero buddy C-Thru would like Brendan to get it together, get out of his Fridge tights and have a good wash. With superheroes in public disfavor and government subsidizing being pulled, its a sad day when they have to haul in Shrink, the last known and captured supervillain. Waiting for nightfall when Shrink can be transported from their motel room, Brendan runs across Claudel, the motel manager who dislikes superheroes, and Jimmy, an embittered cop who can turn invisible for only a few seconds. As Brendan and Claudel start to connect, Brendan discovers a set-up that puts his future, freedom and good name in jeopardy. \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5eceab4bbe6025e24370a7e50a7bedc3a8f08e4","amp;dn":"Alter+Egos+%282012%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5eceab4bbe6025e24370a7e50a7bedc3a8f08e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,236,234,180,187,230,2,94,36,55,10,126,80,167,190,220,58,143,8,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
