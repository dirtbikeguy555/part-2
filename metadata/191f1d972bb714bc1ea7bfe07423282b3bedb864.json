It draws on English-related errors from around 5000 papers written by non-native authors, around 3000 emails, 500 abstracts by PhD students, and over 1000 hours of teaching researchers how to write and present research papers.\nThe exercises are organized into nine chapters on: adjectives and adverbs (e.g. actual vs current, different vs several, continually vs continuously), link words (e.g. on the contrary vs on the other hand, despite vs nevertheless), nouns (e.g. danger vs hazard, measure vs measurement), prepositions (e.g. among vs between, in vs into, with vs within), verbs (e.g. check vs control, compose vs comprise, arise vs raise, exclude vs rule out), false friends and synonyms, spelling, useful phrases, emails.\nNearly all exercises require no actual writing but simply choosing between various options, thus facilitating self-study, e-reading and rapid progress.\nThe exercises can also be integrated into English for Academic Purposes (EAP) and English for Special Purposes (ESP) courses at universities and research institutes.\nThe book can be used in conjunction with the other exercise books in the series:\nEnglish for Academic Research: Writing Exercises\nEnglish for Academic Research: Grammar Exercises\n\nFrom the Back Cover\nEnglish for Academic Research: Vocabulary Exercises\nThis draws on English-related errors from around 5000 papers written by non-native authors, around 3000 emails, 500 abstracts by PhD students, and over 1000 hours of teaching researchers how to write and present research papers.\nThe exercises are organized into nine chapters on:\n*adjectives and adverbs (e.g. actual vs current, different vs several, continually vs continuously)\n*link words (e.g. on the contrary vs on the other hand, despite vs nevertheless)\n*nouns (e.g. danger vs hazard, measure vs measurement)\n*prepositions (e.g. among vs between, in vs into, with vs within)\n*verbs (e.g. check vs control, compose vs comprise, arise vs raise, exclude vs rule out)\n*false friends and synonyms\n*spelling\n*useful phrases\n*emails\n\nAbout the Author\nAdrian Wallwork is the author of around 30 ELT and EAP textbooks.
