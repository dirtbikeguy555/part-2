In a matter of months society has crumbled: There is no government, no grocery stores, no mail delivery, no cable TV. In a world ruled by the dead, we are forced to finally begin living. Rick Grimes is not prepared for this. A couple months ago he was a small town cop who had never fired a shot and only ever saw one dead body. Separated from his family he must now sort through the death and confusion to try and find his wife and son.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef94e5b5338815f77e8eee212707475ca63d753d","amp;dn":"The+Walking+Dead+%5BGraphic+Novels%2FUp-to-Date%5D+%2B+Extras+%2ARE-UP%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef94e5b5338815f77e8eee212707475ca63d753d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,148,229,181,51,136,21,247,126,142,238,33,39,7,71,92,166,61,117,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
