Burroughs short story called Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blade Runner.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The name had to be changed because of that other movie that had just been released in the 1980s.\n\nWilliam S. BurroughsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Blade Runner script was adapted into a film starring a young Bill Paxton (Weird Science, Aliens) by Tom Huckabee and Kent Smith. The film took many years to complete. It was finally released as Taking Tiger Mountain to very limited screenings in 1983. Nearly 30 years after its completion it was screened again at The Texas Theater in Dallas (where Lee Harvey Oswald had been apprehended) and at Spectacle in Brooklyn.\n\nMilitant feminist scientists brainwash research subject to assassinate the Welsh Minister of Prostitution. Meanwhile World War III is being fought and the USA has been invaded.\n\n\n\nVideo: XviD, 640x384, 29.970 fps, 1010 kbps, 01h22m33s\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, joint stereo, 160 kbps\n\nVHS like quality, not brilliant, English audio, no subtitles\n\nAccording to the director, the black and white film stock used for this feature included short ends (unused stock) from the production of the film Lenny (1974).\n\nscreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FaaKfaAgn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FaaKfaAgn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FAaKGaaGn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FAaKGaaGn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/faakHaaGN&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/faakHaaGN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FaakJAAgn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FaakJAAgn&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:723374d875ce17845f026641bfe23b695a04e8d4","amp;dn":"Taking+Tiger+Mountain+-+1983+%28Bill+Paxton%29+Rare+WWIII+Sci-Fi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"723374d875ce17845f026641bfe23b695a04e8d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,51,116,216,117,206,23,132,95,2,102,65,191,226,59,105,90,4,232,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
