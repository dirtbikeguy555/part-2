It is not a complete catalogue of their books, but about 1/8th of their entire library. I'm still working on building this collection to generate at least 1/2 of the Dover Mathematics library. Updates will follow as I add a significant number of books to the collection. I do say though that this is the biggest collection of dover books thus far and I am happy to bring it to you.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8eb45d8c675c0d627b8fadfa10a262a81fc82a93","amp;dn":"Dover+Mathematics+Book+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8eb45d8c675c0d627b8fadfa10a262a81fc82a93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,180,93,140,103,92,13,98,123,143,173,250,16,162,98,168,31,200,42,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
