You will find in this book the best strategy to find them, or at least the one deduced from statistical physics. What is the link with biology? Some proteins use the same strategy to find their target inside a living cell. This example illustrates one of the many links between physics and biology. These links result from an intense research activity in the past years at the interface between those two disciplines. This book describes some of the most recent progresses at this interface: from instrumental progresses used in biology to the mechanical description of a cell, to molecular motors, from brain activity mechanisms to auditory or sensory perception. Many fields are covered from the molecular to the scale at the organ level. A few biological notions are exposed in the first chapter that may help to access the biological aspects of the others. In the end this book may interest people passionate in science, from the simple amateur to the advanced researcher level.\n\nAbout the Authors\nJean FranÃƒÂ§ois Allemand is a professor at the Ãƒâ€°cole normale supÃƒÂ©rieure. His research takes place in the Statistical Physics laboratory and focuses on DNA elastic properties and molecular motors, both in vitro and in vivo with single molecular micromanipulation and fluorescence techniques.\nPierre Desbiolles is a general inspector of the French ministry of education. He was professor at Pierre et Marie Curie University in Paris. His research activities were led in the Kastler laboratory at the Ãƒâ€°cole normale supÃƒÂ©rieure. He got a PhD in cold atoms physics, and in particular on Bose Einstein condensation, he directed experiments, using fluorescence microscopy, to study DNA/protein interactions at the single molecular level.\n\nTable of contents\nCoordinators and contributors v\nPreface xiii\n1 Some biology basic principles 1\n2 Fluorescence microscopy for biological imaging 31\n3 Mechanical studies on single molecules:general considerations 49\n4 Molecular motors 71\n5 Cellular mechanics and motility 91\n6 Exploring neuronal activity with photons 109\n7 Physical principles of hearing 127\n8 Sensing through friction: the biomechanics of texture perception in rodents and primates 149\n9 Intermittent search strategies 169\nIndex 181","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6caa1b0055a1f51aa06d567f0ed885a394ac5b01","amp;dn":"Physics+and+Biology+-+From+Molecules+to+Life+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6caa1b0055a1f51aa06d567f0ed885a394ac5b01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,170,27,0,85,161,245,26,160,109,86,127,14,216,133,163,148,172,91,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
