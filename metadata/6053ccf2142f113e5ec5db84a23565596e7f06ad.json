Desperate, but keenly aware of the answer's potential effect on the public, the programmer strikes a deal with his interrogators, agreeing to re-design the software in exchange for his freedom. As they search to understand why the program answered an ethical question and try to find a way to change its response, the faith and patience of both the programmer and his captors are put to the test. Suspenseful and darkly comic, S.E.R.P. is a film about coercion, innovation, and whether it is possible to do something good in the service of something evil. \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6053ccf2142f113e5ec5db84a23565596e7f06ad","amp;dn":"S.E.R.P.+%282013%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6053ccf2142f113e5ec5db84a23565596e7f06ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,83,204,242,20,47,17,62,94,197,219,132,162,53,101,89,110,127,6,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
