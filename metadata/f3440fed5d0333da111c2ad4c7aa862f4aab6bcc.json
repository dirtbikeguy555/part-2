Father Hendry fails to convince the town council to veto the project. He also invited, sneakily, Katelyn Parks, who was foster-raised out of state after her father Christopher was locked-up for her mother's murder there. Once the basement is broken open, new bloodshed starts, and the horrible truth about the past is gradually unveiled. \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3440fed5d0333da111c2ad4c7aa862f4aab6bcc","amp;dn":"Behind+the+Wall+%282008%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3440fed5d0333da111c2ad4c7aa862f4aab6bcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,68,15,237,93,3,51,218,17,28,42,212,199,170,134,47,74,171,107,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
