But now that sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s made it out of the bloody arena alive, sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s still not safe. The Capitol is angry. The Capitol wants revenge. Who do they think should pay for the unrest? Katniss. And whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s worse, President Snow has made it clear that no one else is safe either. Not KatnissÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s family, not her friends, not the people of District 12. Powerful and haunting, this thrilling final installment of Suzanne CollinsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s groundbreaking The Hunger Games trilogy promises to be one of the most talked about books of the year.\n\n\n\n\n\nStereo Quality, 128kb/s\n\nSize: 641mb\nLength: 11:40:52\n\n\nPlease Seed\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:443241bd90d786aac4308bb100ed676c4908d011","amp;dn":"Mockingjay%2C+Book+3+Unabridged+%28Audiobook%29+%5BSTEREO%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"443241bd90d786aac4308bb100ed676c4908d011","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,50,65,189,144,215,134,170,196,48,139,177,0,237,103,108,73,8,208,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
