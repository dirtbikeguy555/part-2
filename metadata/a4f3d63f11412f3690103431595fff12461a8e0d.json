Playful and inventive, the projects include clothing for all ages, accessories, home decor items, and furnishings. Most feature embellishments and decorative effects -- simple touches that personalize a project with charm -- and use interesting textural fabrics, such as jersey knits, linen, and felt...even paper and vinyl! The authors walk readers through the sewing basics, demystify the lost art of simple pattern-making, provide visual guides to stitches, and give easy instructions for techniques such as applique, doodle-stitching, and layering of fabrics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4f3d63f11412f3690103431595fff12461a8e0d","amp;dn":"Improv+Sewing%3A+A+Freeform+Approach+to+Creative+Techniques%3B+101+F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4f3d63f11412f3690103431595fff12461a8e0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,243,214,63,17,65,47,54,144,16,52,49,89,95,255,18,70,26,142,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
