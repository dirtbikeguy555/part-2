Disc one features a 2016 remaster (by Andrew Walter at Abbey Road) approved by Charlie Burchill and the second disc gathers 12-inch remixes and instrumentals of the singles, a few of which enjoy their CD debut. Various edits and B-sides can be found on the third CD in the set while disc four features previously unreleased BBC John Peel and Kid Jensen radio sessions, recorded in February and August 1982. All ten tracks on disc five are previously unreleased; made up of alternative mixes and demos and the icing on the cake is the sixth and final disc which is a DVD, featuring Charlie Burchill and Ronald Prent's 5.1 surround sound mix, first released on the now long out-of-print DVD-Audio in 2005. This mix of the album is a unique 'full duration' mix which is different to the standard version. DVD also includes promo videos and a few Top of the Pops performances. Note, this is a DVD-V unlike the DVD-A/V disc from previous Simple Minds box sets.\r\n\r\n\r\nArtist: Simple Minds\r\nTitle: New Gold Dream (81-82-83-84) (Super Deluxe Edition)\r\nYear Of Release: 2016\r\nLabel: Virgin\r\nGenre: New Wave, Alternative, Pop Rock, Synth Pop\r\nQuality: 320 kbps\r\nTotal Time: 04:18:56\r\nTotal Size: 686 mb\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCD 1: Original Album.\r\n\r\n01.
