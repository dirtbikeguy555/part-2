It is the band's fifteenth internationally released studio album and the sixteenth to be released in Australia. It is the shortest studio album ever released by the band; at under 35 minutes, it is two minutes shorter than their previous shortest album, Flick of the Switch, released in 1983.\n\nThe group released the debut single from the album, titled &quot;Play Ball&quot;, on 7 October 2014. The song has been a commercial success, reaching the top 40 charts in various nations such as France (at #39) and Switzerland (at #19).\n\nContents\n\n    1 Overview\n    2 Recording\n    3 Singles\n    4 Promotional tour   \n    5 Track listing\n    6 Personnel\n   \n\nOverview\n\nReleased on 28 November 2014 in Australia and due on 2 December 2014 elsewhere, Rock or Bust marks the band's first original recordings since 2008's Black Ice.\n\nRock or Bust is the band's first album without founding member and rhythm guitarist Malcolm Young, who left the band in 2014 for health reasons. Malcolm's departure was later clarified by the band and their management, saying that Malcolm was officially diagnosed with dementia and will possibly never play again.\n\nBefore the album was officially announced, Brian Johnson admitted that it was difficult to make the album without Malcolm Young. He brought about the idea that the album could be called Man Down, but believed the title felt too negative towards Malcolm's situation and overall health.\nOn 6 November 2014, drummer Phil Rudd was arrested for attempting to procure the murder of two men. AC/DC made a statement the same day: &quot;We've only become aware of Phil's arrest as the news was breaking. We have no further comment. Phil's absence will not affect the release of our new album Rock or Bust and upcoming tour next year.&quot; It is not yet clear whether Rudd will remain with the band or not, or who might be his replacement. The attempted procurement charge against Rudd was dropped the following day; charges of possession of methamphetamine and possession of cannabis and a charge of threatening to kill remained. \nRecording\n\nThe album was recorded at Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, Canada, with producer Brendan O'Brien and mixer Mike Fraser. When Rudd was ten days late for the recording sessions, O'Brien was ready to replace him with another drummer, but Rudd arrived and recorded his parts.\n\nThe songs were constructed largely by Angus from material accumulated by the brothers during the recording of previous albums. Angus used a device called The Schaffer Replica on several tracks, a device built for him by AC/DC longtime fanatic, Fil &quot;SoloDallas&quot; Olivieri, to replicate the sound of an original wireless device used in the 1970s and 1980s by Angus that gave him part of his unique sound. \nSingles\n\nThe first single &quot;Play Ball&quot; was first used on 27 September 2014 in a trailer for Major League Baseball on TBS postseason coverage, and the single was released on 7 October, the same day as the tracklisting and artwork were revealed. It became available on iTunes for those who pre-ordered the album.\n\nThe second single is &quot;Rock or Bust&quot;, the official video for which was filmed in front of 500 fans in London on 4 October 2014. The single was released on 17 November 2014. The song leaked by accident when it was uploaded to the AC/DC YouTube account instead of &quot;Play Ball&quot;. It is not related to the 2007 song &quot;Rock 'n' Roll or Bust&quot; by former AC/DC singer Dave Evans.\n\nRudd was absent from both video shoots for the singles, and was replaced by Welshman Bob Richards, who had previously played with Man, Adrian Smith, Asia and Shogun.\nPromotional tour\n\nIn 2015, the band will embark on a world tour to promote Rock or Bust and celebrate the band's 40th anniversary. Malcolm Young will be replaced by his and Angus's nephew, Stevie Young. It is not yet clear whether Rudd will participate in the tour.\nCommercial performance\n\nUpon its release, Rock or Bust became the sixth most pre-ordered studio album of 2014 on Amazon UK.\nTrack listing\n\nAll tracks composed by Angus Young and Malcolm Young.
