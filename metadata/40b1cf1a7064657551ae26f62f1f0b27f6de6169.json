Montgomery\nWiley | November 2013 | ISBN-10: 1118539710 | PDF | 832 pages | 16.2 mb\n\nThis best-selling engineering statistics text provides a practical approach that is more oriented to engineering and the chemical and physical sciences than many similar texts. It is packed with unique problem sets that reflect realistic situations engineers will encounter in their working lives. This text shows how statistics, the science of data is just as important for engineers as the mechanical, electrical, and materials sciences.\n\nCONTENTS\nInside Front cover Index of Applications\nExamples and Exercises\nChapter 1 The Role of Statistics in Engineering 1\nChapter 2 Probability 15\nChapter 3 Discrete Random Variables and Probability Distributions 65\nChapter 4 Continuous Random Variables and Probability Distributions 107\nChapter 5 Joint Probability Distributions 155\nChapter 6 Descriptive Statistics 199\nChapter 7 Point Estimation of Parameters and Sampling Distributions 239\nChapter 8 Statistical Intervals for a Single Sample 271\nChapter 9 Tests of Hypotheses for a Single Sample 305\nChapter 10 Statistical Inference for Two Samples 373\nChapter 11 Simple Linear Regression and Correlation 427\nChapter 12 Multiple Linear Regression 477\nChapter 13 Design and Analysis of Single-Factor Experiments: The Analysis of Variance 539\nChapter 14 Design of Experiments with Several Factors 575\nChapter 15 Statistical Quality Control 663\nAppendix A.
