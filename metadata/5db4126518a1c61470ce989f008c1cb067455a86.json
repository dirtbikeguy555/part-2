Rather than attempt to schedule a blitz,\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d rather just provide what you need to load your own version and just say, Ã¢â‚¬Å“the sooner the better!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n \nFirst, the trailer is only 2:14 long, so the file is only 62MB. HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a direct link to it,\nwhich will be easier to download by right-clicking and choosing to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Save fileÃ¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ or whatever\nyour browser saysÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n \nRaw Video for Upload to Your Channel: http://mediasolidarity.com/group/WNTTASH_Trailer1.avi\n\n(PLEASE consider loading a virgin version just as is, without any added content. You can create a mix\nor whatever youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like in addition to the original. Not a direct order. Just asking so we can start\nmaintaining a consistency and for some stats reasons.)\n \nTo accompany the video, hereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the appropriate thumbnail image (for those that have custom thumbability)Ã¢â‚¬Â¦\n \nThumbnail for Your Uploaded Video: http://mediasolidarity.com/group/trailer_thumb1.jpg\n \nAgain, not an order but a request to please go with the following title, unadulterated. This is actually\na hugely critical piece of the mob-loading concept weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re experimenting with here. The description, tags\nand other settings are up to you though. Just donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t forget the link to the documentary!\n \nTITLE: We Need to Talk about Sandy Hook\n \nDESCRIPTION: Watch the Full Documentary Now!: Ã¢ËœÅ¾ http://mediasolidarity.com/watch.html Ã¢ËœÅ“\n \nCensorship of independent media and overly stringent copyright policies have turned YouTube into\nan unfair ecology. As such, the video can be viewed at the above link, right on our site.\n \nIndependent Media Solidarity is a loose knit group of independent journalists that have come together\nto tackle the issue of Sandy Hook. We are normal people with normal lives, who have families, children,\nand jobs. Although many of us haven't physically met each other, we are united. All we seek are answers\nto the many inconsistencies. But most importantly, we just want the truth made available to all who\nmight seek it.\n \nOver the past 2 years, efforts to explain and expose the Sandy Hook event may seem to have slowed down.\nWe never slowed down.\n \nTAGS:\nsandy hook, newtown, shooting, conspiracy, adam lanza, false flag, gun control, depopulation,\nsandy hook elementary, school shooting, staged, hoax, actors, fake, sandy hook truthers, hoaxers\n \nLICENSE:\nCreative Commons\n \nCATEGORY:\nNews &amp; Politics\n \nI think thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s it for now. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve forgotten something so someone chime in with what that is anytime now.\nGood luck. And, I hope you all like the finished video as much as I do. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get to all the analysis and\ncommentary once we get over the hump.\n \nSee ya!\nBrian D.
