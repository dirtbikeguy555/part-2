The evolving tension between private and public animates this magisterial history of the state. In his hominids-to-guillotines chronicle of humanity's attempts to build strong, accountable governments that adhere to the rule of law, international relations scholar Fukuyama (The End of History) advances two themes: the effort to create an impersonal state free from family and tribal allegiances, and the struggleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½often violentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½against wealthy elites who capture the state and block critical reforms. Fukuyama's multifaceted comparative approach grounds politics and government in the demands of biology, geography, war, and economics, and pays appropriately lavish attention to China (he styles the Qin Dynasty of 221 B.C.E. the world's first modern state), India, and the Islamic countries. A neo-Hegelian, he's especially trenchant on the importance of ideologyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½especially religious beliefsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as an autonomous instigator of social and political change. (He cogently ascribes Europe's distinctively individualistic culture to the medieval Catholic Church's &quot;assault on kinship.&quot;) Fukuyama writes a crystalline prose that balances engaging erudition with incisive analysis. As germane to the turmoil in Afghanistan as it is to today's congressional battles, this is that rare work of history with up-to-the-minute relevance.\n\nVirtually all human societies were once organized tribally, yet over time most developed new political institutions which included a central state that could keep the peace and uniform laws that applied to all citizens. Some went on to create governments that were accountable to their constituents. We take these institutions for granted, but they are absent or are unable to perform in many of todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s developing countriesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½with often disastrous consequences for the rest of the world.\n\nFrancis Fukuyama, author of the bestselling The End of History and the Last Man and one of our most important political thinkers, provides a sweeping account of how todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s basic political institutions developed. The first of a major two-volume work, The Origins of Political Order begins with politics among our primate ancestors and follows the story through the emergence of tribal societies, the growth of the first modern state in China, the beginning of the rule of law in India and the Middle East, and the development of political accountability in Europe up until the eve of the French Revolution.\n\nDrawing on a vast body of knowledgeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½history, evolutionary biology, archaeology, and economicsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Fukuyama has produced a brilliant, provocative work that offers fresh insights on the origins of democratic societies and raises essential questions about the nature of politics and its discontents. \n\n608 pages \nPublisher: Farrar, Straus and Giroux; 1St Edition edition (April 12, 2011) \nLanguage: English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ab1ca6cb3b740c37686b365375eb987c7194b3b","amp;dn":"The+Origins+of+Political+Order+%28Fukuyama%29+-epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ab1ca6cb3b740c37686b365375eb987c7194b3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,177,202,108,179,183,64,195,118,134,179,101,55,94,185,135,199,25,75,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
