Sacred music predominates, by turns monumentally powerful and tenderly fragile.\n\nCompositions featured, in premiere recordings made in TallinnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Niguliste Church, are: &quot;AdamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Lament&quot; for choir and string orchestra; &quot;Beatus Petronius&quot; for two choirs, eight woodwind instruments, tubular bells and string orchestra; &quot;Salve Regina&quot; for choir, celesta and string orchestra; &quot;Statuit ei Dominus&quot; for two choirs, woodwinds and string orchestra; &quot;Alleluia-Tropus&quot; for choir and string orchestra; &quot;L'AbbÃƒÂ© Agathon&quot; for soprano, baritone, female choir and string orchestra. The album concludes with two lullabies - &quot;Estonian Lullaby&quot; and &quot;Christmas Lullaby&quot; - for female choir and string orchestra. In the title piece &quot;AdamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Lament&quot;, PÃƒÂ¤rt uses a poetic text by Silouan of Athos to emphasize our common heritage in the figure of Adam. &quot;Adam is all of us who bear his legacy. This 'Total Adam' has been suffering and lamenting for thousands of years on Earth. Adam himself, our primal father, foresaw the human tragedy and experienced it as his personal guilt. He has suffered all human cataclysms, unto the depths of despair.&quot;\n\nThe album was assembled from recordings made in several different places, by several different groups: the Latvian Radio Choir, Vox Clamantis, and the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir, with Estonian and Latvian orchestras. But TÃƒÂµnu Kaljuste serves as conductor throughout, and each sound environment reflects the music heard; there is no sense of an anthology.\n\nStrongly recommended for PÃƒÂ¤rt fans.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01.
