In the case of project management training, these changes are mainly\nones of emphasis on particular topics as perceived by setters of examination papers or\ncompilers of national or international standards. The soft topics now feature more widely in\nexamination questions and although these are not unique to project management they are, of\ncourse, part and parcel of good general management. Whether industry attaches the same\nimportance to some of these emphasised topics is a matter of debate. Nevertheless, a\nnumber\nof changes have been incorporated in this 6th edition to enable the reader to keep\nabreast of events.\nShortly after the 5th edition was published, The APM added Project Governance to the\nsyllabus of the APMP examination and a new chapter on this important topic has therefore\nbeen added. This was specially written by David Shannon, Managing Director of Oxford\nProject Management Ltd., who is an acknowledged expert on the subject and was the founder\nof the APM Specific Interest Group on Governance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4de71d94fb01dc65fb48753d6d165790ddfe449b","amp;dn":"Project+Management%2C+Planning+and+Control%2C+6th%282014%29+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4de71d94fb01dc65fb48753d6d165790ddfe449b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,231,29,148,251,1,220,101,251,72,117,61,109,22,87,144,221,254,68,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
