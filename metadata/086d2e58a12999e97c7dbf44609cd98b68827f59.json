Liberace was for the piano what Warhol for painting. Las Vegas was for him his second home. And this album includes part of his live performances. He gave the easy to listen music a curious blending of classic and pop music with his well known eccentricities and mannerisms, but for better or worst was part of the sixties, with the rack pack, neon lights and psychedelic ambiance.[/quote]\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Liberace - The Best of Liberace (MCAD 4060)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Liberace\nAlbum................: The Best of Liberace (MCAD 4060)\nGenre................: Instrumental\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1972\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.3.0 20130526\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 100 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.
