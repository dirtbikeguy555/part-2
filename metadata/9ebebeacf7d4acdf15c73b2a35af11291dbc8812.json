Includes a large foldout Biochemistryland Map. Graduate students and medical students have different needs in their learning of biochemistry. Medical students often complain that their biochemistry courses do not focus on clinical relevance. This book, while not a reference book or a dissertation on all aspects of biochemistry, selects the most clinically relevant material that every clinician should know, and presents it in a way that enables the student to quickly see and understand clinical biochemistry as a conceptual whole, with a focus on the metabolic pathways and their diseases.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ebebeacf7d4acdf15c73b2a35af11291dbc8812","amp;dn":"Clinical+Biochemistry+Made+Ridiculously+Simple","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ebebeacf7d4acdf15c73b2a35af11291dbc8812","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,190,190,172,247,212,172,223,21,199,59,42,53,175,17,41,29,188,136,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
