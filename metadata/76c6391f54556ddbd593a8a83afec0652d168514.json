Therefore OS X and iOS are UNIX operating systems. While there are numerous books and articles written to teach network development in a UNIX environment there is surprisingly little dedicated to teaching network development specifically in an Apple environment. In this book we will be covering the standard UNIX networking stack with BSD Sockets as well as AppleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s frameworks like CFNetworking and Bonjour.\n\n&quot;iOS and OS X Network Programming Cookbook&quot; is an enthralling code-focused book on developing client and server applications for the iOS and OS X environments. You will learn how to integrate a number of Unix (BSD Sockets), Apple specific (CFNetworking, NSMutableURLRequest, Bonjour) and third party APIs (AFNetworking, MKNetworking) with your own apps.\n\n&quot;iOS and OS X Network Programming Cookbook&quot; begins by showing you how to build both client and server applications using the BSD Socket Library as well as AppleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s CFNetworking library. The sample code includes samples for both iOS and OS X.\n\nIt then covers how to add Bonjour to publish, find, and connect to services. This can be used to create peer-to-peer applications over local networks. Finally it shows how to integrate third-party libraries like Libnet, LibPCAP, AFNetworking, and MKNetworking with the readerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s apps.\n\nA lot of developers do not realize that iOS is a full UNIX-based operating system that contains a full set of networking APIs. These APIs can be used to create both client- and server-based applications in the iOS environment as well as OS X. Using the AppleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bonjour library you will learn how to publish, find, and connect the services together without hardcoding the connection information. There are also a number of third-party APIs that can be used to easily connect iOS and OS X applications to web-based services. Finally this book will cover several low level libraries like LibNET and LibPCAP on the OS X environment.\n\n&quot;iOS and OS X Network Programming Cookbook&quot; will cover several UNIX, Apple, and third-party libraries and APIs. The book will show the user how to integrate all of these libraries and APIs with their applications.\n\nApproach\n\nThis book follows a recipe-based approach that will heavily focus on the code and how to integrate the samples with the readerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s projects.Each recipe consists of one or more methods that you can put directly into your app and use.\nWho this book is for\n\nThis book is ideal for developers that want to create network applications for the Apple OS X or iOS platforms. All examples are written in Objective-C using XCode as the IDE. Knowledge of Objective-C and X-Code is essential.\n\n\nWhat you will learn from this book\n\nCreate client- and server-based applications with the BSD socket API\nCreate client- and server-based applications with CFNetworking\nPublish, find, and connect client applications with servers using AppleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bonjour library\nUse the AFNetworking library to connect to web-based services\nConnect to web-based services using the MKNetworking library\nExplore the LibNET packet construction library in OS X\nGet to grips with the LibPCAP packet capture library in OS X\nDiscover AppleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s high-level APIs to connect to devices via Bluetooth\nConnect two devices with a Bluetooth connection\n\n\n\nimage\nScientia est potentia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76c6391f54556ddbd593a8a83afec0652d168514","amp;dn":"iOS+and+OS+X+Network+Programming+Cookbook+2014+%5BPDF%5D%7EStormRG%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76c6391f54556ddbd593a8a83afec0652d168514","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,198,57,31,84,85,109,219,213,147,168,168,58,254,192,101,45,22,133,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
