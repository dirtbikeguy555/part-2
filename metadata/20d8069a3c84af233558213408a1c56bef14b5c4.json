You see everything from the complete lighting setup (and all the gear used), to the shoot (including all the camera settings and a contact sheet of the progression of the shoot), to the all-important part that most books donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t dare includeÃ¢â‚¬â€œthe post-processing and retouching in Photoshop. This book also breaks new ground in the visual way it teaches you the lighting setup. There arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t any sketches or 3D modelsÃ¢â‚¬â€œyou see the lighting layout in a full-page photo, taken from above during the live shoot, so you can see exactly where everythingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s positioned (the subject, the photographer, the lighting, the backgroundÃ¢â‚¬â€œyou name itÃ¢â‚¬â€œyou see it all). Plus, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see side, over-the-shoulder, and more behind-the-scenes views, so you can absolutely nail the lighting every time.\n\nLEARN THE LIGHTING SETUPS THE PROS USE\nEach year, Scott trains thousands of professional photographers during his Light It. Shoot It. Retouch It. LIVE! seminar tour and now, for the first time ever, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s taken that incredibly popular style of learning and put in into book form. Now everyone can have a real-world reference for getting the same looks todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clients are clamoring for.\n\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn:\n\n    The step-by-step layouts for creating the most-requested and sought-after lighting looks\n    How to get more out of one light than you ever thought you could (this is worth it alone!)\n    How to control and shape your light without breaking the bank\n    The camera settings, gear, and power settings for every shot\n    The retouching techniques the pros really use to make their subjects look their very best\n    How to retouch hair, eyes, lips, skin, and lots of other little retouching tricks that make a really big difference\n    How to create high-contrast portrait effects without buying expensive plug-ins\n    A host of insider tricks, invaluable shortcuts, and kick-butt special effects to give you a real advantage over the competition\n\n\nPlus, Scott includes a special bonus chapter that shows how to create these same studio looks using off-camera hot shoe fl ashes and the modifi ers made for them. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never been a book like it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20d8069a3c84af233558213408a1c56bef14b5c4","amp;dn":"Light+It%2C+Shoot+It%2C+Retouch+It+-+Scott+Kelby","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20d8069a3c84af233558213408a1c56bef14b5c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,216,6,154,60,132,175,35,53,88,33,52,8,161,197,107,239,20,181,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
