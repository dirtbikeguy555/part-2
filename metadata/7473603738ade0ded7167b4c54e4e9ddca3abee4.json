As the team reaches their initial landing zone (LZ), Logan ropes down as the helicopter barely dodges a surprise attack by a rocket. Left on his own in the war zone, Logan must reach the Spanish church and regroup before the terrorist ringleader, Irena Moralez, completes whatever messed up plan she has in mind. It probably involves blowing stuff up.\n\nTurns out Irena's a total oops and she drops the roof on the three R6, as Gabe and Kan are taken away (and presumably shot) as Logan is conveniently left for dead.\n\nBut Logan gives no oopss.\n\nLogan proceeds to rise from his dusty grave and hunts down Irena and her followers through Vegas with his new, completely incompetent teammates Michael and Jung, who would sooner take a bullet to the head than follow orders effectively. To top that, Irena has a bomb that turns people inside out or some gross oops that makes a hell of an amount of blood.\n\nLet's go stop them.\n\n\n~INSTALL NOTES~\n                                      ,,                                        \n      db                   .g8&quot;&quot;&quot;bgd  db  `7MM&quot;&quot;&quot;YMM  `7MN.   `7MF'MMP&quot;&quot;MM&quot;&quot;YMM \n     ;MM:                .dP'     `M        MM    `7    MMN.
