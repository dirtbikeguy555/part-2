Moore shared the stage with such blues and rock luminaries as B.B. King, Albert King, Colosseum II, Greg Lake and Skid Row (not to be confused with the heavy metal band of the same name), as well as having a successful solo career. He guested on a number of albums recorded by high profile musicians, including a cameo appearance playing the lead guitar solo on &quot;She's My Baby&quot; from Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.Moore died of a heart attack in his hotel room while on holiday in Estepona, Spain, in February 2011.\n\n.: Gary Moore :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img691.imageshack.us/img691/8990/garymooree.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img691.imageshack.us/img691/8990/garymooree.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums :.\n\nSolo albums\n1973 Grinding Stone (remastered) @320\n1978 Back on the Streets @320\n1980 G-Force (remastered) @320\n1982 Corridors Of Power (remastered) @320\n1983 Victims Of The Future (remastered) @320\n1984 Dirty Fingers (remastered) @320\n1985 Run For Cover @320\n1987 Wild Frontier (remastered) @320\n1989 After the War (remastered) @320\n1990 Still Got The Blues (remastered) @320\n1992 After Hours @320\n1995 Blues for Greeny @320\n1997 Dark Days In Paradise @320\n1999 A Different Beat @320\n2001 Back To The Blues (remastered) @320\n2004 Power Of The Blues @320\n2006 Old New Ballads Blues @320\n2007 Close As You Get @320\n2008 Bad For You Baby @320\n\nLIve albums\n1981 Live at the Marquee Club @320\n1984 We Want Moore!
