But after four years in which the firm dazzled Wall Street as a $100 billion moneymaking juggernaut, it suddenly suffered catastrophic losses that jeopardized not only the biggest banks on Wall Street but the stability of the financial system itself. The dramatic story of Long-TermÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fall is now a chilling harbinger of the crisis that would strike all of Wall Street, from Lehman Brothers to AIG, a decade later. In his new Afterword, Lowenstein shows that LTCMÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s implosion should be seen not as a one-off drama but as a template for market meltdowns in an age of instabilityÃ¢â‚¬â€and as a wake-up call that Wall Street and government alike tragically ignored.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0b4459375d9ce0260126a058ec0a9dc43cb2656","amp;dn":"When+Genius+Failed%3A+The+Rise+and+Fall+of+Long-Term+Capital+Manag","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0b4459375d9ce0260126a058ec0a9dc43cb2656","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,180,69,147,117,217,206,2,96,18,106,5,142,192,169,220,67,203,38,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
