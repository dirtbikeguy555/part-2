Although Thelonious Monk and John Coltrane played together for several months in 1957, until the discovery of a live tape (which has been issued on Blue Note), the music on this record was all that existed of their historic collaboration. Coltrane developed rapidly during his period with Monk and he is heard in brilliant form on Trinkle, Tinkle* and *Nutty.*\n- Scott Yanow/AMG\n\t\n\n\n\nThelonious Monk with John Coltrane is a 1957 album by Thelonious Monk. It was recorded while Monk was engaged in a six-month stay at New Yorks legendary Five Spot in 1957 with his quartet of the time, which included Coltrane. While this album features this quartet on only three tracks - *Ruby, My Dear*, *Trinkle, Tinkle* and *Nutty* - a more extensive collection can be found in *The Complete 1957 Riverside Recordings.*\n\nBecause of the historical significance of this album it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n      Side A\n      Ruby, My Dear (Monk) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:17\n      Trinkle, Tinkle (Monk) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:37\n      Off Minor (Monk) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:15\n\n      Side B\n      Nutty (Monk) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:35\n      Epistrophy (Kenny Clarke, Monk) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:07\n      Functional (Monk) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:46\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n      Thelonious Monk - Piano\n      John Coltrane - Tenor Saxophone\n      Gigi Gryce - Alto Saxophone (track 3)\n      Coleman Hawkins - Tenor Saxophone (tracks 3 &amp; 5)\n      Ray Copeland - Trumpet (tracks 3 &amp; 5)\n      Wilbur Ware - Double Bass\n      Shadow Wilson - Drums (except track 3)\n      Art Blakey - Drums (track 3)\n\n\nTechnical Log\n\nRCM Hannl limited with Rotating Brush\nMusic Hall MMF 9.1 Turntable\nTonearm: Pro-Ject 9cc evo with Pure Silver Wires\nCartridge: Nagaoka MP-500\nBrocksieper Phonomax (Tube Phono PreAmp)\nE-MU 0404 external USB 2.0 Audiointerface\nInterconnections : Silent Wire NF5\nWaveLab 6 recording software\niZotope RX Advanced 1.21 for resampling and dithering\n\nVacuum cleaning - TT - Brocksieper Phonomax - E-MU 0404 - WaveLab 6 (24/192)  manual click removal - analyze (no clipping, no DC Bias offset) - converted to 24/96 with iZotope RX Advanced 1.21 - split into individual Tracks - FLAC encoded (Vers. 1.21)\n\nNo silence been removed, please burn gapless to match original tracklayout.\n\n\nPersonal Note\n\nWith my vinyl rips I try to catch the whole beauty of records. Therefore I don't use any post-processing or any sound improver. What you get is a clear and flat transfer.\n\nFor getting a clear sound I'll do an extended washing of each record with my RCM, which can take up to 30 minutes brushing for each side. Resistant ticks and clicks I try to remove as good as possible, but the priority is not to loose any musical information.\n\nSurface noises, as long they are not to high, are left in place. Only on bad pressings or on records recorded with extremly low level I do a fade in-/-out. As John Peel said, 'Life is full of surface noises'. In some cases this means I have to do a compromise... The result has to pass my personal quality criteria which is IMO quite high.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a6d6c19e7f6ecbbaf172d27376af7359cb753b8","amp;dn":"Thelonious+Monk+with+John+Coltrane+%281958%29%5BVinyl-180g%5D-aksman+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a6d6c19e7f6ecbbaf172d27376af7359cb753b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,109,108,25,231,246,236,187,175,23,45,39,55,106,247,53,156,183,83,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
