This has made the Stileman Foundation, which provides the medical makeover, the richest and most powerful corporation in the world, and has also created an elite expert in making and sheltering fortunes.\n\nOne of these ''immortals,'' Dallas Barr, has been invited to join a super-elite group calling itself the ''Steering Committee,'' but finds instead that he has been set up for murder. Fleeing with his lover, Maria Marconi, an immortal who has decided to forgo further rejuvenation and therefore will die in a few years, Dallas sets himself on the trail of his would-be assassins, and of the secret someone wishes to keep him from discovering.\n\n\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf7bf8684ca64ed2f931c57887b2a195180f9f45","amp;dn":"Joe+Haldeman+-+Buying+Time+%5BThe+Long+Habit+Of+Living%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf7bf8684ca64ed2f931c57887b2a195180f9f45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,123,248,104,76,166,78,210,249,49,197,120,135,178,161,149,24,15,159,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
