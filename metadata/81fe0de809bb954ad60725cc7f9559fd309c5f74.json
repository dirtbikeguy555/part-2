I&amp;#039;m a Danny Phantom addict. i&amp;#039;m a 33 yr old father of three and my two sons (3yr and 2 yrs) and i watch this show every time it is on. The artwork of the show is superb when compared to many of todays, or the last decades, cartoons. The plot and storyline are excellent for the average teen or even young teen, and the lines are better than many of the adult intended lines from bugs bunny. Heavy with sarcasm, dry humor and a bumbling fathers exploits, this show rocks. There&amp;#039;s enough reality based topics in the plot for any teen to relate to, and many adults will take great humor in the dialogue. I personally believe the show caters to a sense of family and friends, either group can benefit from this. Whether you choose to watch this with your family or sit back with your family, you&amp;#039;ll certainly enjoy this cartoon. I&amp;#039;m proud to say i watch this.
