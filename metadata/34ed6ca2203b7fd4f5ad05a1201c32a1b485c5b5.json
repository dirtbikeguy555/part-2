We can describe meat as rotten, cheese as mouldy, milk as sour and butter as rancid - but we would not say sour meat, or rotten milk. Knowing how words are naturally used together is known as collocation.\r\n\r\nA good knowledge of these word combinations greatly improves the style of written and spoken language for non-native speakers. Knowledge of collocations is often tested in exams such as IELTS, TOEFL and TOEIC.\r\n\r\nContaining a range of word games, quizzes and exercises, this workbook will help intermediate learners to develop core language skills in a challenging, yet entertaining way.\r\n\r\nCheck Your Vocabulary for Natural English Collocations\r\nEnglish | 2007 | ISBN: 9780713683172 | PDF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34ed6ca2203b7fd4f5ad05a1201c32a1b485c5b5","amp;dn":"Check+Your+Vocabulary+for+Natural+English+Collocations","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34ed6ca2203b7fd4f5ad05a1201c32a1b485c5b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,237,108,162,32,59,127,212,245,173,5,161,32,28,50,161,180,133,197,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
