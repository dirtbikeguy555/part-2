King Diamond and Andy La Rocque meticulously mastered and enhanced these 23 songs into the ultimate editions, chosen by the band from both the Roadrunner and Metal Blade catalogs.\n*\nIn a recent interview with Full Metal Jackie, King Diamond stated about &quot;Dreams Of Horror&quot;: &quot;Metal Blade got the chance, through getting some of licenses from Roadrunner Ã¢â‚¬â€ well, Roadrunner is under Warner Ã¢â‚¬â€ so they got some licenses from them to actually release some vinyl of the old Roadrunner stuff, but also to do a best-of [collection]. And that's something that's coming out, a genuine best-of that is spanning the entire KING DIAMOND career. So there is one disc that is only Roadrunner material, one disc that is Metal Blade, but it's [being] released through Metal Blade, the whole thing. And it sounds amazing.&quot;\n\nHe added: &quot;We went back to before all the remastering that was done on our stuff and got back to the original stuff and could tweak that. And you hear things that youÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ If you [got into the band] later on, you could only buy certain versions of the albums these days. And they don't all sound the way I would like [them] to sound. And now we got the chance to actually select the songs ourselves, me and Andy, and we worked on them hardcore with this new gear to get them as optimal as possible. And they sound very close to how they originally sounded. You will hear things you can't hear on the versions you can buy today.&quot;\n\nRegarding his plans for a new KING DIAMOND LP, the vocalist said: &quot;We signed a new deal with Metal Blade for another three albums. We have done a lot of stuff lately with that in mind. We have invested a lot of the new recording budgets for the next couple of albums into making Andy La Rocque's, the guitarist's studio in Sweden, better. We got new equipment in, I got a new vocal studio here in my house. It was finished a few days before I went over to Europe recently and I actually managed to rehearse in it, which was great. But it's Pro Tools, new speakers, it's a vocal booth from Portland, Oregon Ã¢â‚¬â€ VocalBooth.com. I got it in with the floating floor, the whole thing; it's amazing. The speakers are also handbuilt in the U.S., in Portland, Oregon, by Barefoot. It was actually a KING DIAMOND fan that was part of putting mine together. So I got a small pair, which is still twelve hundred and some watts between the amps in them, in my studio room and then some bigger ones in my living room. I didn't know music could sound like that. They are for mixing and mastering and everything Ã¢â‚¬â€ handmade in the U.S.A. And I didn't think they could sound like that. I'm still blown away by it.&quot;\n-Blabbermouth.com\n\n*\n\n*\n\nTrack Listing\n\nDisc 1 - Roadrunner:\n\n01. The Candle\n02. Dressed In White\n03. The Family Ghost\n04. Black Horsemen\n05.

Diamond, Denner and Hansen had recently departed the group Mercyful Fate, and decided to form a new band under the King Diamond moniker, as it was already known from the Mercyful Fate days. In 1985, King Diamond released their debut album Fatal Portrait. Since then the band have released a total of twelve studio albums (most of them concept albums), two live albums, two extended plays, five compilations and five singles.\n\nSince the band's inception, there have been over fifteen musicians in and out of King Diamond, with the only two mainstays being vocalist King Diamond and guitarist Andy LaRocque. In 1987 the band released their second studio release Abigail (their first concept album). Throughout the 1980s, King Diamond released a total of four studio albums. In the early 90's, the band was put on hold when King Diamond reunited with his former outfit Mercyful Fate. After reforming King Diamond in 1994, Diamond would balance recording and touring with both Mercyful Fate and his eponymous band throughout the 90's. Since the early 2000s, King Diamond have kept recording and touring and since 2001 the band has been composed of vocalist King Diamond, guitarist Andy LaRocque, guitarist Mike Wead, bassist Hal Patino and drummer Matt Thompson.\n\n*\n\n\n*\nGenre:\tHeavy\nSubgenre:\tOccult Heavy Metal\nBitrate:\t320 k\nSize:\t251.72 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n24 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad264cd58ba523147289e2067c2ccdc214f0aef5","amp;dn":"King+Diamond+-+Dreams+of+Horror+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad264cd58ba523147289e2067c2ccdc214f0aef5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,38,76,213,139,165,35,20,114,137,226,6,124,44,205,194,20,240,174,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
