Like any film by Robert Bresson, it provokes widely different responses: Many critics have hailed it as a masterpiece, while others (as Pauline Kael observed) &quot;may find it painstakingly tedious and offensively holy.&quot; It all depends on what the viewer brings to Bresson&amp;#039;s seemingly simple tale of a donkey named Balthazar, who experiences kindness and cruelty as he is passed from owner to owner. Populated by a variety of sinners and saints alike, the film can be seen as a simple animal fable, as Balthazar suffers nobly at the hands of his handlers. Dig deeper into Bresson&amp;#039;s art, however, and you&amp;#039;re likely to find a very Catholic story with strong parallels to the life of Christ and his unbearable burden of the sins of mankind.\n\nA profound masterpiece from one of the most revered filmmakers in the history of cinema, director Robert Bresson&amp;#039;s Au hasard Balthazar follows a much-abused donkey, Balthazar, whose life strangely parallels that of his owner, Marie. A beast of burden suffering the sins of man, Balthazar nevertheless nobly accepts his fate. Through Bresson&amp;#039;s unconventional approach to composition, sound, and narrative, this seemingly simple story becomes a moving religious parable of purity and transcendence. \n\nThis is the Criterion collection rip, enjoy this profound Bresson masterpiece! :)\n\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\nwww.freakyflicks.tk\n\nSEED AS LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED...PLEASE!\n\n&amp;#039;If we all seed just 1:1, give at least what we take, these torrents will NEVER DIE&amp;#039;\n\nSimply search for &amp;#039;freakyflicks&amp;#039; \n*************************************** \n************** FREAKYFLICKS ************* \n***************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c06d02173cc347e508a5d8e93c3e194fa6cf7ecd","amp;dn":"Au+Hasard+Balthazar+%28Robert+Bresson%2C+1966%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c06d02173cc347e508a5d8e93c3e194fa6cf7ecd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,109,2,23,60,195,71,229,8,165,216,233,60,62,25,79,166,207,126,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
