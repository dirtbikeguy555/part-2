This revision is based on an understanding of the nature, culture, and motivations of today's students and on extensive feedback from instructors. These substantial changes meet the needs of students, who not only face a business world increasingly complicated by ethical issues, globalization, and technology, but who also have more demands on their time. To help them meet these challenges, this textbook shows students how business transactions, which are the result of business decisions, are recorded in a way to show their effects on the financial statements.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d66a034da198ce6eab3d09137557cea30e7c86ea","amp;dn":"Principles+of+Accounting+11th+Edition.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d66a034da198ce6eab3d09137557cea30e7c86ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,106,3,77,161,152,206,110,171,61,9,19,117,87,206,163,14,124,134,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
