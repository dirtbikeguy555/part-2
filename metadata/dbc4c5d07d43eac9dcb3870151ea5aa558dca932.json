Left alone after his grandfather's death, this unusual boy is happy to spend his days hunting and eating and eating some more. But everything changes on the day he meets Bulma - a bossy, blue-haired beauty with boys on the brain. Together, they set out to track down the seven magic Dragon Balls and make the wish that will change their lives forever.\n\nAnd that's just the beginning! Goku also spends some time on Turtle Island where he and Krillin study martial arts under the legendary Master Roshi. The old hermit may not look like much, but if his new pupils can find him a woman, he'll make sure they're ready to rumble at the upcoming World Martial Arts Tournament!\n\nContains episodes 1-31\n\nThe Saga Of Goku/Emperor Pilaf Saga\n1 Secret of the Dragon Ball\n2 The Emperor's Quest\n3 The Nimbus Cloud Of Roshi\n4 Oolong the Terrible\n5 Yamcha the Desert Bandit\n6 Keep an Eye on the Dragon Balls\n7 The Ox-King on Fire Mountain\n8 The Kamehameha Wave\n9 Boss Rabbit's Magic Touch\n10 The Dragon Balls Are Stolen\n11 The Penalty Is Pinball\n12 A Wish to the Eternal Dragon\n13 The Legend Of Goku\n\nTournament Saga\n14 Goku's Rival\n15 Look Out for Launch\n16 Find That Stone!\n17 Milk Delivery\n18 The Turtle Hermit Way\n19 The Tournament Begins\n20 Elimination Round\n21 Smells Like Trouble\n22 Yamcha Vs.
