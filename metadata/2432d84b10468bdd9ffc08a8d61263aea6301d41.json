The group's leader was singer Ronnie James Dio, who had previously become acquainted with the metal masses as the frontman of Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow from 1975-1978 and Black Sabbath from 1979-1982. Come the early '80s, Ronnie James was ready to finally head out on his own, forming Dio and recruiting a stellar backing band, consisting of a few former bandmembers, ex-Rainbow bassist Jimmy Bain and ex-Black Sabbath drummer Vinny Appice (Carmine Appice's brother), in addition to ex-Sweet Savage guitar shredder Vivian Campbell. Lyrically, the group would retain the same subject matter that Ronnie James specialized in with his previous outfits (dungeons and dragons, swords and sorcery, damsels in distress, etc.), but musically, Dio were more melodically based than Rainbow or Sabbath. The group scored a hit right off the bat with its 1983 debut release, Holy Diver, which spawned such popular MTV videos as &quot;Rainbow in the Dark,&quot; as well as its title track. \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tMetal\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Holy Diver\n02.Rainbow In The Dark\n03.Don't Talk To Strangers\n04.We Rock\n05.The Last In Line\n06.Evil Eyes\n07.Rock 'N' Roll Children\n08.Sacred Heart\n09.Hungry For Heaven\n10.Hide In The Rainbow\n11.Dream Evil\n12.Wild One\n13.Lock Up The Wolves\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2432d84b10468bdd9ffc08a8d61263aea6301d41","amp;dn":"Dio+-+Diamonds+The+Best+Of+Dio+%281992%29+MP3+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2432d84b10468bdd9ffc08a8d61263aea6301d41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,50,216,75,16,70,139,221,159,252,8,168,214,18,99,174,166,48,29,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
