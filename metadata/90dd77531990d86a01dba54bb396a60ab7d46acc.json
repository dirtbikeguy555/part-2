Over the years they went through various lineup changes, playing only a few gigs due to the members being unable to drive and being in school, also no underground metal scene at the time. Sylosis released a couple of EPs in the UK on a small indie label, In at the Deep End Records. In November, 2007 Sylosis got an email from Nuclear Blast saying they'd love to work with the band and signed to them a month later, in which their debut album was released on October 24 2008.\n\nLead guitarist Josh Middleton was quoted as saying on an interview with About.com:\n\n&quot;The foundation of our sound is old school Bay Area thrash. We don't downtune and we don't play breakdowns. We do like to incorporate lots of different metal styles and textures into our music. We like make all of our songs really epic. We like progressive stuff, brutal stuff and melodic stuff.&quot;\n\nTheir debut album Conclusion of an Age has a lot of themes, but is generally not a concept album. Lyrically, the album deals with the end of the human race, in how nature reclaims the earth again. The artwork shows a world living with the human race. There are no religious beliefs behind the writings however. After recording their debut album, guitarist Gurneet Ahluwalia was replaced by ex-Viatrophy guitarist Alex Bailey, ready for the early 2009 European tour with The Black Dahlia Murder, Cephalic Carnage and Psycroptic.\n\nSylosis were one of the opening acts on the Tuborg (third) stage at the infamous Download Festival held at Castle Donington, along with appearances at the New England Metal and Hardcore Festival, and an opening slot on the Bohemia stage at Sonisphere Festival. A UK headline tour has been announced for October/November 2009, but was cancelled as the band were offered an opening slot on the Dragonforce UK tour in November/December 2009.\n\nOn May 19th, 2010, Sylosis revealed through their Myspace blog that they had parted ways with vocalist Jamie Graham. Instead of replacing the vocalist, Josh Middleton (lead guitar) took up vocal duties as well as playing lead.\n\nBANDMEMBERS:\n\nJosh Middleton Ã¢â‚¬â€œ lead guitar (2000Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent), lead vocals (2010Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\nCarl Parnell Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass guitar (2000Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\nAlex Bailey Ã¢â‚¬â€œ rhythm guitar (2008Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent)\nAli Richardson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums (2014Ã¢â‚¬â€œpresent\n\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01.
