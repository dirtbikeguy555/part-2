Eating too much sugar can be as harmful to your health as drinking alcohol or smoking, as it can lead to an increased risk of diabetes, heart disease, weight gain and tooth decay, amongst other health problems.\r\n\r\nWith more than 100 recipes, Sensationally Sugar Free offers sweet and simple dishes using healthier alternatives to refined sugar. Instead of loading your food with refined white sugar, why not use stevia, fruit or honey to sweeten up your dishes?\r\n\r\nFeaturing tips and tricks to help you wipe out the white stuff, the recipes range from everyday snacks and treats to more indulgent dishes for entertaining guests, and you can even satisfy your sweet tooth with a dessert that isn't overloaded with sugar! From Roquefort &amp; pear muffins, Strawberry scones and Banana bread to Chocolate chip ice cream, Pineapple meringue pie and Red velvet cake, each recipe uses a sweet alternative to refined sugar - without compromising on taste","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6e9c30c2cac632eabc0fe5f280d3eb56b74ff53","amp;dn":"Sensationally+Simply+Sugar+Free+%282016%29+%28Epub%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6e9c30c2cac632eabc0fe5f280d3eb56b74ff53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,233,195,12,44,172,99,46,171,192,254,95,40,13,62,181,107,116,255,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
