Blind Faith fused the psychedelic blues of Eric Clapton and the soulful vocals and keyboards of Steve Winwood with the polyrhythmic, Afrocentric leanings of drummer Ginger Baker. &quot;Can&amp;#039;t Find My Way Home&quot; is easily one of the hippie era&amp;#039;s most lyrically poignant, sonically subtle tunes. The record has a lot of surprises; &quot;Presence of the Lord&quot; is rousing and melancholy at the same time, while the way the bass and guitar double-team on the introductory melodic line to &quot;Had to Cry Today&quot; makes a hard-rock clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© fresh again. The 10-minute drum solo on &quot;Do What You Like&quot; is pretty good as 10-minute drum solos go; Blind Faith is not a purchase for the jam-shy, especially in its present, bloated form, which adds almost an hour and a half of unreleased jams and mixes. And while surely there are levitational moments within the five 12-to-16-minute improv sections included here, the excess (and lack of great material; remember that this band was only together a few months) grows tiresome. One notable exception is the &quot;Change of Address Jam,&quot; excerpts from which were pressed up as a record label change-of-address announcement back in the day. It&amp;#039;s got a pleasant, near-swinging, Graham Bond/Booker T on Quaaludes vibe, with Winwood&amp;#039;s keyboards rollicking nicely in a manner recalling his work on Electric Ladyland. The rest of disc two is for wank aficionados and completists only. --Mike McGonigal\n\n-=AMG Review=-\n\nBlind Faith&amp;#039;s first and last album, more than 30 years old and counting, remains one of the jewels of the Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood, and Ginger Baker catalogs, despite the crash-and-burn history of the band itself, which scarcely lasted six months. As much a follow-up to Traffic&amp;#039;s self-titled second album as it is to Cream&amp;#039;s final output, it merges the soulful blues of the former with the heavy riffing and outsized song lengths of the latter for a very compelling sound unique to this band. Not all of it works ÃƒÂ¢?? between the virtuoso electric blues of &quot;Had to Cry Today,&quot; the acoustic-textured &quot;Can&amp;#039;t Find My Way Home,&quot; the soaring &quot;Presence of the Lord&quot; (Eric Clapton&amp;#039;s one contribution here as a songwriter, and the first great song he ever authored) and &quot;Sea of Joy,&quot; the band doesn&amp;#039;t do much with the Buddy Holly song &quot;Well All Right&quot;; and Ginger Baker&amp;#039;s &quot;Do What You Like&quot; was a little weak to take up 15 minutes of space on an LP that might have been better used for a shorter drum solo and more songs. Unfortunately, the group was never that together as a band and evidently had just the 42 minutes of new music here ready to tour behind.\n\n\n\n\nPROUDLY PRESENTS:\n\n  &gt; Blind Faith - Blind Faith\n\nArtist...[ Blind Faith             \nTitle....[ Blind Faith             \nGenre....[ Rock                    \nYear.....[ 2007                    \nEncoder..[ LAME3.97 (-V2 --vbr-new)\nBitrate..[ VBRkbps                 \nQuality..[ Joint-Stereo            \nkHz......[ 44.1kHz                 \nSource...[ CDDA                    \nDate.....[ Nov-18-2007             \nType.....[ Album                   \nSize.....[ 185,6 MB                \nLable....[ Polydor                 \nCat.Nr...[ n/a                     \nURL......[ n/a                     \n\n\nNr.

In actual fact,   \nBlind Faith was probably both. By any ordinary reckoning, the  \nquartet compiled an enviable record. They generated some great \nsongs, two of them (&quot;Sea of Joy,&quot; &quot;Presence of the Lord&quot;) still\nregarded as classics 30-plus years later; they sold hundreds of\nthousands of concert tickets and perhaps a million more albums \nat the time; and they were so powerful a force in the music    \nindustry that they were indirectly responsible for helping     \nfacilitate the merger of two major record companies that       \nevolved into Time Warner, before they&amp;#039;d released a note of     \nmusic on record. And they did it all in under seven months     \ntogether.                                                      \nBlind Faith&amp;#039;s beginnings dated from 1968 and the breakup of    \nCream. That band had sold millions of records and eventually   \nachieved a status akin to that of the Beatles or the Rolling   \nStones. Cream&amp;#039;s internal structure was as stressful as it was  \nmusically potent, however, as a result of the genuine personal \ndislike between bassist/singer Jack Bruce and drummer Ginger   \nBaker, which occasionally overwhelmed the respect they had for \neach other as musicians, leaving guitarist/singer Eric Clapton \nto serve as mediator. After two years of service as a referee, \nspent all the while in an unremitting spotlight, the public    \nseemingly hanging on every note he played, Clapton was only too\nhappy to leave that situation behind.                          \n                                                               \nThe initial spark for Blind Faith came from Clapton and Steve  \nWinwood, whose band Traffic had split up in January of 1969,   \namid acrimonious disputes over songwriting and direction.      \nWinwood at age 20 was some three years younger than Clapton,   \nand had emerged as a rock star at 17 as a member of the Spencer\nDavis Group, spending three years as the lead singer on a      \nstring of enviable R&amp;B-based hits. His concerns were musical --\nhe wanted to work with the best musicians, and wanted to       \nexperiment with jazz, which led him to leave the Spencer Davis \nGroup and form Traffic, which proved riven by egos nearly as   \nstrong as the members&amp;#039; musical impulses. The January 1969      \nbreakup would be the first of several temporary splits in the  \nband&amp;#039;s lineup.                                                 \n                                                               \n......\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97a40cd42fdfd53a9041f18141e056bfbc1c0a8c","amp;dn":"Blind+Faith+-+Blind+Faith+%282007-Remastered-Deluxe+Edition-2CD-VB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97a40cd42fdfd53a9041f18141e056bfbc1c0a8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,164,12,212,47,223,213,58,144,65,241,129,65,224,86,191,188,28,10,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
