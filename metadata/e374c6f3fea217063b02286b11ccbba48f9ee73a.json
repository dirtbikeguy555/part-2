While numerous other R&amp;B greats of the early '50s had been moving in a similar direction, none of them matched the sheer electricity of Richard's vocals. With his bullet-speed deliveries, ecstatic trills, and the overjoyed force of personality in his singing, he was crucial in upping the voltage from high-powered R&amp;B into the similar, yet different, guise of rock &amp; roll. Although he was only a hitmaker for a couple of years or so, his influence upon both the soul and British Invasion stars of the 1960s was vast, and his early hits remain core classics of the rock repertoire.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Tutti Frutti\n02.Long Tall Sally\n03.Good Golly Miss Molly\n04.Slippin' And Slidin' (Peepin' And Hidin')\n05.Rip It Up\n06.Ready Teddy\n07.Heeby-Jeebies\n08.She's Got It\n09.The Girl Can't Help It\n10.All Around The World\n11.Lucille\n12.Send Me Some Lovin'\n13.Jenny Jenny\n14.Miss Ann\n15.Keep A Knockin'\n16.Ooh!
