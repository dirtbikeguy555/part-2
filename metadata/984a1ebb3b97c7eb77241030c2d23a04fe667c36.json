The conspiracy against Marijuana, the real reason it's illegal and the hypocrisy of the Phony Drug Wars are all exposed in this modern day Pirate's tale","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:984a1ebb3b97c7eb77241030c2d23a04fe667c36","amp;dn":"21st+Century+Pirate+-+Sean+O%27Reilly.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"984a1ebb3b97c7eb77241030c2d23a04fe667c36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,74,30,187,59,151,199,235,119,36,16,48,194,210,58,4,254,102,124,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
