Metkus Jr. (Author)\n\nTRUE PDF, BOOKMARKED and INDEXED\n\n\nPublication Date: September 25, 2013 | ISBN-10: 0071807632 | ISBN-13: 978-0071807630 | Edition: 1\n\nNEARLY 200 TRACINGS AND 150 CASES TEACH YOU THE ART AND SCIENCE OF ECG INTERPRETATION\n\nWritten to be the go-to resource for residents and students on cardiology rotation, ECG Rounds replicates the experience of having a master clinician rounding with you--skillfully linking ECG abnormalities to a particular case.\n\nThe author presents a set of tracings, which when taken together, demonstrate most of the abnormalities that a generalist physician trainee should be familiar with. Each tracing is followed by clinical questions and fully explained answers designed to reinforce important electrocardiographic concepts.\n\n192 TRACINGS DETAIL:\nNormals, Normal Variants, and Artifacts\nNarrow Complex Tachycardias\nWide Complex Tachycardias\nBradycardias and Blocks\nChamber Enlargement and Hypertrophy\nIschemia\nMyocardium, Pericardium, and Pulmonary Artery\nIngestions, Electrolyte Abnormalities, and Exposures\nSyndromes, Riddles, and Miscellaneous Arrhythmia\n\nRather than encouraging you to memorize endless facts, ECG Rounds focuses on practical interpretation based on reasoning and process. The design allows you to choose tracings by level of difficulty, teaching topic, or sequentially as presented in the book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9402740fb12155c91411e55fa534e94b48f4e341","amp;dn":"ECG+Rounds+%28McGraw-Hill%29+%5BPDF%5D%5Btahir99%5D+VRG.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9402740fb12155c91411e55fa534e94b48f4e341","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,2,116,15,177,33,85,201,20,17,229,95,165,52,233,75,72,244,227,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
