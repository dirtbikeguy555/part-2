Dorf (CRC, 2005).pdf\r\n\r\nFirst published in 1995, The Engineering Handbook quickly became the definitive engineering reference. Although it remains a bestseller, the many advances realized in traditional engineering fields along with the emergence and rapid growth of fields such as biomedical engineering, computer engineering, and nanotechnology mean that the time has come to bring this standard-setting reference up to date.\r\n\r\nNew in the Second Edition\r\n\r\n19 completely new chapters addressing important topics in bioinstrumentation, control systems, nanotechnology, image and signal processing, electronics, environmental systems, structural systems\r\n131 chapters fully revised and updated\r\nExpanded lists of engineering associations and societies\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Engineering Handbook, Second Edition is designed to enlighten experts in areas outside their own specialties, to refresh the knowledge of mature practitioners, and to educate engineering novices. Whether you work in industry, government, or academia, this is simply the best, most useful engineering reference you can have in your personal, office, or institutional library","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdc40f16001424bc0a7c83d3da899817dd0cd507","amp;dn":"The+Engineering+Handbook+2nd+ed+-+Richard+C.+Dorf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdc40f16001424bc0a7c83d3da899817dd0cd507","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,196,15,22,0,20,36,188,10,124,131,211,218,137,152,23,221,12,213,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
