It teaches the cultivation of peace of mind, not as an escape from life into protected quiescence, but as a power center out of which comes driving energy for constructive personal and social living. It teaches positive thinking, not as a means to fame, riches or power, but as the practical application of faith to overcome defeat and accomplish worthwhile creative values in life. It teaches a hard, disciplinary way of life, but one which offers great joy to the person who achieves victory over himself and the difficult circumstances of the world.\n\nThis book is written to suggest techniques and to give examples which demonstrate that you do not need to be defeated by anything, that you can have peace of mind, improved health, and a never-ceasing flow of energy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e26740d104b62e7f955f5b7050c1a9b970a763c","amp;dn":"The+Power+of+Positive+Thinking+-+Norman+Vincent+Peale","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e26740d104b62e7f955f5b7050c1a9b970a763c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,38,116,13,16,75,98,231,249,85,245,183,5,12,26,155,151,10,118,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
