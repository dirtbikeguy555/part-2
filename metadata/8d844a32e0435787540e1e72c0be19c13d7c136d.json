First of all, as the recipes in this book prove, they taste fantastic. What's more, they're a breeze to cook and they're incredibly versatile-you can eat them raw or roasted, steamed or stirfried, tossed into salads, made into a juice, packed into pancakes, or stirred into stews. Greens are as easy on the purse as they are on the waistline. Most importantly, they're packed with must have nutrients that make you feel good.\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d844a32e0435787540e1e72c0be19c13d7c136d","amp;dn":"Green+Foods+for+Men%3A+Powerful+Foods+for+a+Clean%2C+Healthy+Diet+-+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d844a32e0435787540e1e72c0be19c13d7c136d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,132,74,50,224,67,87,135,84,14,30,114,192,190,25,193,61,124,19,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
