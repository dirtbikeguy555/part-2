Originally from Michigan, Richelle now lives in Seattle, Washington.\n\n#1 - Vampire Academy\n\nLissa Dragomir is a Moroi princess: a mortal vampire with an unbreakable bond to the earth's magic. She must be protected at all times from Strigoi; the fiercest and most dangerous vampires--the ones who never die.\n\nThe powerful blend of human and vampire blood that flows through Rose Hathaway, Lissa's best friend, makes her a Dhampir; she is dedicated to a dangerous life of protecting Lissa from the Strigoi, who are hell-bent on making her one of them.\n\nAfter two years of illicit freedom, Rose and Lissa are caught and dragged back to St. Vladimir's Academy, hidden in the deep forests of Montana. Rose will continue her Dhampir education. Lissa will go back to being Queen of the elite Moroi social scene. And both girls will resume breaking hearts.\n\nFear made Lissa and Rose run away from St. Vladimir's--but their world is fraught with danger both inside and out of the Academy's iron gates. Here, the cutthroat ranks of the Moroi perform unspeakable rituals and their secretive nature and love of the night creates an enigmatic world full of social complexities. Rose and Lissa must navigate through this dangerous world, confront the temptation of forbidden romance, and never once let their guard down, lest the Strigoi make Lissa one of them forever...\n\n#2 - Frostbite\n\nRose Hathaway's got serious guy trouble. Her gorgeous tutor Dimitri has his eye on someone else, her friend Mason has a huge crush on her, and she keeps getting stuck in her best friend Lissa's head while she's making out with her boyfriend, Christian. (So not cool).\n\nThen a massive Strigoi attack puts St. Vladimir's on high alert, and the Academy crawls with Guardians--including the legendary Janine Hathaway...Rose's formidable, long-absent mother. The Strigoi are closing in, and the Academy's not taking any risks. This year, St. Vlad's annual holiday ski trip is mandatory.\n\nBut the glittering winter landscape and the posh Idaho resort only provide the illusion of safety. When three students run away to strike back against the deadly Strigoi, Rose must join forces with Christian to rescue them. Only this time, Rose--and her heart--are in more danger than she ever could have imagined...\n\n#3 - Shadow Kiss\n\nIt's springtime at St. Vladimir's Academy, and Rose Hathaway is this close to graduation. Since making her first Strigoi kills, Rose hasn't been feeling quite right. She's having dark thoughts, behaving erratically, and worst of all...might be seeing ghosts.\n\nAs Rose questions her sanity, new complications arise. Lissa has begun experimenting with her magic once more, their enemy Victor Dashkov might be set free, and Rose's forbidden relationship with Dimitri is starting to heat up again. But when a deadly threat no one saw coming changes their entire world, Rose must put her own life on the line--and choose between the two people she loves most.\n\n#4 - Blood Promise\n\nRose Hathaway's life will never be the same.\n\nThe recent attack on St. Vladimir's Academy devastated the entire Moroi world. Many are dead. And, for the few victims carried off by Strigoi, their fates are even worse. A rare tattoo now adorns Rose's neck, a mark that says she's killed far too many Strigoi to count. But only one victim matters . . . Dimitri Belikov. Rose must now choose one of two very different paths: honoring her life's vow to protect LissaÃ¢â‚¬â€her best friend and the last surviving Dragomir princessÃ¢â‚¬â€or, dropping out of the Academy to strike out on her own and hunt down the man she loves. She'll have to go to the ends of the earth to find Dimitri and keep the promise he begged her to make. But the question is, when the time comes, will he want to be saved?\n\nNow, with everything at stakeÃ¢â‚¬â€and worlds away from St. Vladimir's and her unguarded, vulnerable, and newly rebellious best friendÃ¢â‚¬â€can Rose find the strength to destroy Dimitri? Or, will she sacrifice herself for a chance at eternal love ?\n\n#5 - Spirit Bound\n\nDimitri gave Rose the ultimate choice. But she chose wrongÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nAfter a long and heartbreaking journey to DimitriÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s birthplace in Siberia, Rose Hathaway has finally returned to St. VladimirÃ¢â‚¬â„¢sÃ¢â‚¬â€and to her best friend, Lissa. It is nearly graduation, and the girls canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wait for their real lives beyond the AcademyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s iron gates to begin. But RoseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heart still aches for Dimitri, and he's out there, somewhere.\n\nShe failed to kill him when she had the chance. And now her worst fears are about to come true. Dimitri has tasted her blood, and she knows in her heart that he is hunting her. And if Rose won't join him, he won't rest until he's silenced her...forever.\n\n#6 - Last Sacrifice\n\nIt all comes down to now.\n\nMurder. Love. Jealousy. And the ultimate sacrifice.\n\nThe Queen is dead and the Moroi world will never be the same. Now, with Rose awaiting wrongful execution and Lissa in a deadly struggle for the royal throne, the girls find themselves forced to rely upon enemies and to question those they thought they could trust...\n\nBut what if true freedom means sacrificing the most important thing of all ?\n\nEach other.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bc07bd16292aa6145d5da3f0e864cfe5358268d","amp;dn":"Vampire+Academy+Series+-+Richelle+Mead","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bc07bd16292aa6145d5da3f0e864cfe5358268d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,192,123,209,98,146,170,97,69,213,218,63,14,134,76,254,83,88,38,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
