Siglos Karaoke Pro is a KJ assistant that \nwill make your shows better and easier to run. Here is how Siglos Karaoke Pro can \nhelp you with running your karaoke show:\n\n\nUse you computer to run your karaoke show. Stop carrying hundreds of discs, \nrisking their damage and loss.\n\nTwo-screen display with preview window will make running your shows a pleasure, \nand advanced display features will make lyrics look better \n\nPowerful song database allows to find any song in a matter of seconds \n\nAutomatic singer rotation management keeps singers queue in order; you may add \nnew song requests while singers are on stage \n\nSinger announcement will save you from 'Who is next' questions, and time guide \nwill allow to answer 'When will I sing?' questions without thinking about it \n\nSinger history will save you from typing songs for regulars, and venue filter \nhelps when running shows in various places \n\nSong silence detector automatically removes silence from the beginning and the \nend of the CD+G song, allowing you to squeeze more songs in the show \n\nUse Key changer to change the key of the song when adding request or when singer \nis already singing \n\nUse Tempo changer to slow down or speed up the song \n\nHave your show run in Automatic mode if you are unable to operate the computer \n\nPlay CD+G discs -- if a singer brings his own CD+G disc, just place it in the \nqueue and insert when prompted -- the show will go on. \n\nYou do not have to start other players when nobody is singing. Fill-in playlist \nkicks in automatically when the song is stopped and fades away when its time for \nnext performance \n\nIf you cannot see the singer's display, use Preview window to see what singer sees \n\nUse Playlist view to check the actual songs in the queue, instead of seeing the \nrotation order \n\nExport songs from the database and use it in songbook software, or use a \nspreadsheet program and create the books yourself \n\nUse rotation presets to preload rotations for frequent singers \n\n\n\n* Siglos Karaoke Professional feature list: \n\nAdvanced karaoke player \nSiglos uses high-quality karaoke player engine that allows to replace solid \nbackground with images.\n\nSupport for various karaoke formats \nAllows to play various karaoke formats, including MP3+G, ZIP, BIN, MIDI Karaoke \n(MID and KAR), KMA. \n\nAlso supports video formats (AVI and MPEG). \nTo convert CD+G discs from your collection into digital format you need to use \nPower CD+G Burner \n\nExternal screen support \nIf your computer supports dual display (most laptop computers do), the program \nwindow is displayed on your laptop screen, and the karaoke lyrics on the external \nTV screen. You may work with the program while lyrics are being displayed. \n\nSong database \nSiglos Karaoke Professional has a powerful database build-in. It will scan your \nhard disc, index karaoke songs, and then will provide you with search interface \nto find songs in a matter of seconds.\n\nSinger rotation management \nTo run the show in fair way you need to make sure that one person does not sing\nmore often than the other. To do this Siglos places the singer in the queue, and \nfirst play one song for each singer before allowing the second round. The order \nof the singers is displayed in the list on the left of the rotation window. \n\nSinger announcements \nWhen a singer is about to sing, Siglos displays an introduction screen that shows \nthe name of the singer and chosen song.\nIt also displays a fully customizable scrolling reminder during the performance \nwith the name of the next singer. \n\nSong silence detector \nMany karaoke songs have silence at the beginning and at the end (used usually to \ndisplay CD+G maker's logo). Siglos automatically skips these silent parts, so you \ncan play more songs. \n\nSinger history \nSiglos keeps singer names and songs they sung in the database. So if you have \nregulars on your shows, adding their requests is a matter of several mouse clicks \n\nKey and tempo changer \nHigh-quality key changer allows you to adjust the pitch of the song to better suit \nthe singer. You may also slow down or speed up the music. Even better, Siglos \nremembers which singer uses which key and tempo modification. \n\nFill-in Playlist \nSongs placed in the fill-in playlist are played when nobody is singing. You no \nlonger have to switch to CD player or play MP3 using other software -- Siglos \nwill do this automatically, fading the music in and out when necessary. \n\nPreview window \nIf singers' screen is placed in a position that you cannot see it, you can use \nPreview window to monitor the lyrics. \n\nVenue manager \nSiglos allows to tag the singers by the venue name. If you are running shows in \nvarious places it allows you to filter the singers and songs. \n\nAutomatic mode \nIf for some reason you have to leave the show for couple of minutes, Siglos allows \nto put the show on autopilot. It will display singer announcement for defined \namount of time, and then will start the song. \n\nTime information \nRotation list displays when the singer will sing the next time. This information \nis constantly updated. \n\nPlaylist view \nIf rotation view does not give you all the information you need, or if you are \nused to work with list of songs rather than the list of singers, you may switch \nto playlist view. \n\nPromo message \nYou may add your message to the scrolling reminder -- it may be used to promote \nyour next show, or display other informations. \n\nCD+G disc playback \nIf a singer asks you to play a song from his CD+G disc, simply select Add CD+G \ndisc track, choose the number of the track, and you will be prompted to insert \nthe disc at the appropriate time.\nSiglos does not copy the songs from customer's discs to the hard disc, as it is \nillegal. \n\nExport song list \nYou may export the songs from the database to CSV or XML file, and then use it to \ncreate a songbook.\nYou may use a dedicated songbook software, or use a spreadsheed program (like free \nCalc from OpenOffice) to create the songbook yourself. \n\nSiglos Karaoke Professional comes with per-user license. It does not have \nactivation dongles nor requires internet connection. If you own two computers \nyou may install it on both, providing you are the only user of the program. \n\n\n\nVersion history \n\nSiglos Karaoke Professional v1.2.55:\n+ Added tag support to KMA import\n\nSiglos Karaoke Professional v1.2.53:\n* Fixed key changer for non-CDG files\n\nSiglos Karaoke Professional v1.2.52:\n* Playlist font change works in non-KJ mode in Pro version\n+ Added song advance on fill-in list (KJ options cont.)\n\nSiglos Karaoke Professional v1.2.50:\n+ Fixed bug causing music to stop when modifying fill-in list\n\n\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\n- Windows XP and Vista \n- 1.5 GHz or faster processor \n- 256 MB RAM \n- 32-bit display (1024x768 resolution is required to display all windows properly)\n\nTo play CD+G discs your drive needs to be able to read CD+G subcodes -- most of \nthem do, but please download the evaluation version to make sure. \n\n\n\nMore info:    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.powerkaraoke.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.powerkaraoke.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.powerkaraoke.com/src/prod_siglos-karaoke-professional.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.powerkaraoke.com/src/prod_siglos-karaoke-professional.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;When using TPB please read these important notes: \n****************************************************\n\n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of \n    their capabilities (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not trusting \n    keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting antimalware-apps sending scanning-results to their companies can coz\n    keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n06- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n10- Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting &quot;TPB's Most Ridiculous Comments&quot;:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting my account*:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n*All torrents scanned with:\n1- Norton Internet Security  \n2- Avast! Antivirus AV Pro  \n3- AVG Antivirus Pro   \n4- Kaspersky AV Pro  \n5- NOD32 AV  \n\n...and also with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected by \n   other anti-malware apps probably are false positives!\n\n\n&lt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt;\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of PB members abuse their PB membership by intenionally posting \nfake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to \nfrustrate PB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less \ndownloadspeed etc etc. \n\nIt's in the benefit of PB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and PB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\n                                         \n* Status torrent at aug, 29 2009 - 03.15 CET: clean, tested &amp; working.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c76d83d0087569f4d248d960b36d3902a06d71b","amp;dn":"Doblon+Siglos+Karaoke+Professional+1.2.55+%2B+Key+%5BRH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c76d83d0087569f4d248d960b36d3902a06d71b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,118,216,61,0,135,86,159,77,36,141,150,11,54,211,144,42,6,215,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
