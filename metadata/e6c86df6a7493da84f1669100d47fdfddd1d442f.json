It appears his total absence will lasts about one year: long enough for things to really be shaken up at Princeton-Plainsboro.\n- House meets his new fellow to be, Jessica Adams, while in prison and brings her onto his team after his release.\n- The shape of the team forms into something completely different, marking the biggest shift since Season 4. Both Dr. Adams and Charlyne Yi's new character Dr. Chi Park become fellows.\n- It appears Thirteen moves off the team at least temporarily, and Olivia Wilde leaves the series to pursue other career options.\n- Eric Foreman is acting as the new Dean of Medicine after Cuddy's resignation. \n\n\nList of Episodes:\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=641803#pid641803&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=641803#pid641803&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tXviD+x264\nPack size:  \t\t7,1 GB \nDuration: \t\t43 min avg. per episode\nWidth: \t\t\t624 pixels\nHeight: \t\t352 pixels\nAspect ratio: \t\t16:9\nFrame rate: \t\t23.976 fps\nAudio: \t\t\tMP3+AAC\nNr. of Files:\t\t22 + 1 Special + 1 Trailer + 1 Teaser + 1 txt = 26\n                        (This torrent includes the one hour special &quot;Swan Song&quot; that was aired before the series finale)\n\nAll files properly named, keeping the original file names intact.\nThis pack wouldn't have been possible without you, we worship you,\n\n+++eztv+++TvTeam+++VTV+++scenebalance+++TorrentDay+++eztv+++\nand the release groups:\n2HD,ASAP,FQM,LOL,IMMERSE,FEVER,SYS,ORENJI,REWARD,SPASTiKUS,MiXED,MOMENTUM, and all the others (too many to mention them all)\n\n###################  You like your show in one pack?  ###################\n#########################  Here you go!  #########################\nVisit the KABLAM!!! @ forum.suprbay.org\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor questions,requests,comments feel free to PM me on SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWant to be kept in the loop?
