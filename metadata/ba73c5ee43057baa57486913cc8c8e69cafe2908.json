Drums\n2. Organ\n3. Piano\n4. Sampler\n5. Specials\n6. Synth-others\n7. Synth-virtual analog\n\nFor installation with FL Studio :(dont know how to install for other apps sorry)\n\nExtract the rar of the plugin you want to install and put the plugin map in the {where-ever-you-installed-FL}Image-lineFL Studio 8PluginsVST folder... \nThen start FL studio and rightclick one of the preset instruments on your screen (when you havent changed it ; kick, hat, clap and snare by default: just rightclick one of them) and then move your mouse over either insert or replace and then press more. A white screen pops up with all your currently installed plugins. You have to press refresh and then press fast scan. It should say that 1 new plugin (or more) has been found and it will be colored red in the list. Then you tick the box in front of it and press twice to open it.\n\nThis all applies for FL studio 8 (xxl producer edition?)\n\nI hope you enjoy these plugins as much as i do ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba73c5ee43057baa57486913cc8c8e69cafe2908","amp;dn":"Synths+and+other+instrument+plugins+for+FL+Studio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba73c5ee43057baa57486913cc8c8e69cafe2908","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,115,197,238,67,5,123,170,87,72,105,19,204,140,142,105,202,254,41,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
