Originally from Tennessee, Fuel moved to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where they played local Pennsylvania bars and nightclubs. Their first EP Porcelin was released in 1996, and sold well locally, spawning a small radio hit with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShimmer.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The popularity of the EP brought them to the attention of SonyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 550 imprint, which released their second EP, Hazelton, the following year. The bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s full length debut, Sunburn, came out in 1998. Shimmer was again included, and almost became a Top 40 hit, while the other singles (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBittersweet,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJesus or a Gun,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSunburnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) received some airplay. After laying low for two and a half years, Fuel came back with their second album, Something Like Human, in 2000, and scored a Top 40 hit with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHemorrage (In My Hands)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (#17), as well as going platinum with the album. A third album, Natural Selection, came out in 2003, and was another big seller.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.last.fm/music/Fuel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.last.fm/music/Fuel&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAll completely tagged.
