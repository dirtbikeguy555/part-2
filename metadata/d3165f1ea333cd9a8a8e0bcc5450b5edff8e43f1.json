Yet now that it's here, \nAll the Roadrunning--while beautiful--seems somehow underwhelming, \nand without a true centerpiece. Anyone familiar with the artists' famous catalogues would expect \nthe repertoire to be poetic and brooding, and that Harris's ethereal soprano would add light to \nKnopfler's dark Prozac rumblings. But the surprise is that the album is too tame, never breaks \nout of its midtempo groove, and never takes any big chances.\n\nThat said, there is much to like: The marital scrapbook romp of &quot;This Is Us,&quot; the bluesy bickering \nof &quot;Right Now,&quot; the wrenching poignancy of the 9/11-inspired ballad &quot;If This Is Goodbye.&quot; Knopfler, \never the hypnotic guitarist, turns in some thrillingly droll and laconic vocals, and Harris brings \nthe spirited coltishness of her early work to &quot;Belle Starr.&quot; In the end, though, this is not so much \na duet album as two famously melancholy musicians singing together--at times, strikingly so.\n\nMP3 320 kbps\n\nEnjoy and please seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3165f1ea333cd9a8a8e0bcc5450b5edff8e43f1","amp;dn":"Mark+Knopfler+%26+Emmylou+Harris+-+All+the+Roadrunning+2006","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3165f1ea333cd9a8a8e0bcc5450b5edff8e43f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,22,95,30,163,51,205,154,138,142,11,204,84,80,181,237,255,142,67,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
