If thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the case itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all right, you are just extremely uptight and a liberal dose of Jefferies brand of humor is exactly what you need to sort yourself out.\n\n\nPLOT: There's something magical about an Australian accent that seems to make even the most caustic wit come off with good-natured charm. And that delicate blend of deviant behavior and good intentions has skyrocketed Aussie comic Jim Jefferies to international acclaim with critics and fans alike. In this new hour-long special, the man hailed by Q Magazine as &quot;Britain's most offensive stand-up comedian&quot; shares fresh tales from his life on the edge, including a menage a trois in Montreal and attending a party where God is on the guest list.\n\nSeed &amp; Enjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d16c14e247696f6c0687492cf7ee09e98e8dd2aa","amp;dn":"Jim.Jefferies.Fully.Functional.720p.unknown.x264-Strajow.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d16c14e247696f6c0687492cf7ee09e98e8dd2aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,108,20,226,71,105,111,108,6,135,73,44,247,238,9,233,142,141,210,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
