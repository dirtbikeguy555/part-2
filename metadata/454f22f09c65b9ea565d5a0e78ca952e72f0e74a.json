Their relationship becomes increasingly complicated as Stefan's vicious, and malevolent older brother Damon Salvatore returns with a plan to wreak havoc on the town and a revenge against his younger brother. Both brothers begin to show affection towards Elena, mainly because of her resemblance to their past love Katherine Pierce. It is revealed that Elena is a descendant of Katherine, who eventually returns with plans against the trio.\n\nThe series is set in the fictional town of Mystic Falls, Virginia, a town charged with supernatural history since its settlement of migrants from New England in the late 17th century.

Some of the founding families of Mystic Falls include the Salvatores, the Gilberts, the Fells, the Forbes and the Lockwoods. They guard the town mainly from vampires, although there are other supernatural threats such as werewolves, witches, ghosts and hybrids.\n\nThe Vampire Diaries Season 2\n\nThe season focuses on the return of Elena's doppelgÃƒÂ¤nger Katherine, the introduction of Werewolves, the sun and moon curse, and the arrival of Klaus.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you think torrents are too slow in downloading, check www.libretanan.com for direct downloads of these episodes (completely free).\n\nIf direct downloads are slow for you, then use torrent to download these episodes.
