It stars Alan Bates, Oliver Reed, Glenda Jackson and Jennie Linden. The movie was adapted by Larry Kramer from the novel of the same name by D. H. Lawrence.\n\nGlenda Jackson won the Academy Award for Best Actress. She was the first actress to win the award for a role which had a nude scene. The movie was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Director and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium.\n\nThe movie is famous for an extended scene in which Alan Bates and Oliver Reed wrestle in the nude. According to the Internet Movie Database, both actors were initially apprehensive about filming the scene due to the insecurity they had about being naked in front of each other. Russell had to assure them that the set would be off-limits and that there would be no rehearsal. Because of this scene, which caused had to be altered to get an X rating in Britain, the film is considered along with Haskell Wexler&amp;#039;s Medium Cool (1969), to be among the first mainstream movies to feature male frontal nudity.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:040fea1b3ab40f5a81a997cf6c7316fa62ef4a50","amp;dn":"Women+In+Love+-+1969+Drama+-+Glenda+Jackson%2C+Oliver+Reed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"040fea1b3ab40f5a81a997cf6c7316fa62ef4a50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,15,234,27,58,180,15,90,129,169,151,207,108,115,22,250,98,239,74,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
