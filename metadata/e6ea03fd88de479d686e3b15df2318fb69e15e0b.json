He is known especially for his scrupulous devotion to his art and style, a perfectionism that cost him enormous toil but brought him only limited success in his own lifetime.\n\nMADAME BOVARY (1857) is a seminal work of Realism and one of the most influential novels ever written.  Its realistic portrayal of bourgeois life led to a trial on charges of the novel's alleged immorality.  Henry James said the book &quot;has a perfection that not only stamps it, but that makes it stand almost alone; it holds itself with such a supreme unapproachable assurance as both excites and defies judgment.&quot;\n\nSALAMMBO (1862), a historical novel set in Carthage during the 3rd century, is largely an exercise in sensuous and violent exoticism.  Following the success of BOVARY, it was another best-seller and sealed his reputation.  SENTIMENTAL EDUCATION (1869), a vast panorama of France under the July Monarchy and intended as the moral history of his generation, was largely misunderstood by the critics and received a cool public reception.  The diversity of themes in THREE TALES (1877) -- &quot;A Simple Heart&quot;, &quot;Saint Julian the Hospitalier,&quot; and &quot;HÃ©rodias&quot; -- shows Flaubert's talent in all its aspects and is considered by many to be his masterpiece.\n\nAfter his death in 1880, Flaubert's fame and reputation grew steadily, strengthened by the publication of his unfinished and savagely satiric BOUVARD AND PÃ‰CUCHET (1881) and the many remarkable volumes of his Correspondence. \n\n\nThe following books are in ePUB and/or PDF format as indicated:\n\n\n                                  == FICTION ==\n\n* Bouvard and PÃ©cuchet (Dalkey Archive, 2005).
