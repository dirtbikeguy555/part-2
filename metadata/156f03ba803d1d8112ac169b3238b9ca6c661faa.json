Then the body disappears into thin air. It's hard to call the police when the murderers are invisible to everyone else and when there is nothing -- not even a smear of blood -- to show that a boy has died. Or was he a boy?\n\nThis is Clary's first meeting with the Shadowhunters, warriors dedicated to ridding the earth of demons. It's also her first encounter with Jace, a Shadowhunter who looks a little like an angel and acts a lot like a jerk. Within twenty-four hours Clary is pulled into Jace's world with a vengeance, when her mother disappears and Clary herself is attacked by a demon. But why would demons be interested in ordinary mundanes like Clary and her mother? And how did Clary suddenly get the Sight? The Shadowhunters would like to know. . . . \n\nExotic and gritty, exhilarating and utterly gripping, Cassandra Clare's ferociously entertaining fantasy takes readers on a wild ride that they will never want to end.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:156f03ba803d1d8112ac169b3238b9ca6c661faa","amp;dn":"City+of+Bones%3A+The+Mortal+Instruments%2C+Book+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"156f03ba803d1d8112ac169b3238b9ca6c661faa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,111,3,186,128,61,29,129,18,172,22,155,50,56,185,202,108,102,31,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
