Your soundtrack will be the sound of crunching metal, the splatter of motor oil on the windshield, and the screams of skidding tires. With a white-knuckled grip on the wheel, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have the choice of 23 crashmobiles (from a terrifying monster truck to a high octane Dragster) and 30+ levels of hellish fury and motorized terror. \n\nCarmageddon was surrounded by huge controversy. A game about mowing down innocent race cars and getting points for it was not exactly something the world was prepared for back when it released. However, all this noise just made everyone talk about this title even more and it's evident that behind all this fuss there is actually an extremely fun game with very unique and crazy gameplay. Now you can experience it for yourself in its full, original, glory.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a3f7d9621499644e8035bb46d6accb336e1f35d","amp;dn":"Carmageddon+Max+Pack+-+GOG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a3f7d9621499644e8035bb46d6accb336e1f35d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,63,125,150,33,73,150,68,232,3,91,180,109,106,204,179,54,225,243,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
