Almost Instantly! In less than 10 minutes after reading this, you could be eating the best Paleo banana bread ever! More importantly, though, you can nourish your body and feel good about eating these treats.\nSticking to a Paleo diet and giving up foods that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve eaten all your life is not easy. You can no longer just walk into a bakery or grocery store and buy desserts or cookies or pastries. There are no pre-packaged Paleo cake mixes. You want to stay Paleo and you want to get healthier, but you shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to be in the kitchen for hours or else deprive yourself completely.\nDonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Give in! Grocery stores and food companies arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t looking out for you. They want to sell you the cheapest junk food that will taste good but make you feel terrible. I know. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been there.\nWhen I first went Paleo, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d give in to temptation all the time. Every afternoon, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d walk through Walgreens blindly hoping to find something gluten-free and Paleo to eat. After 20 minutes of useless searching, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d usually end up buying some random treat that was completely non-Paleo!\nI would tell myself that I would only eat one cookie, but while sitting in my office for the next couple hours, I wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop until the entire packet was gone. It's hardly surprising that I felt tired, grumpy, and bloated for days afterward. Giving in to temptation certainly didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help me lose weight, either. And worst of all, I'd end up wanting to eat even more junk!\nYou Have a Choice. Eat Better Desserts. It's taken me years to figure out how to escape that vicious cycle. I started by learning to make a variety of Paleo desserts and treats that were both delicious and made me feel better. It took me a long time, though, to figure out exactly which Paleo ingredients actually worked well as substitutes. I went through much experimentation (many desserts were outright failures - some even explodes!) and much taste-testing (always the fun part).\nMost importantly, though, I perfected all of my recipes so that they're super fast, use easy-to-find &amp; common Paleo ingredients, are low in Paleo sugars, and still taste absolutely amazing! In fact, that's what I have blogged about for years at AncestralChef.com, where you can find a ton of comments from happy Paleo dieters.\nI've spent the time and effort over the years figuring everything out and perfecting these desserts, which is why I'm sure you'll enjoy these 30-minute Paleo dessert recipes!\nConvenience. Health. Yumminess. For Less. HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the way I look at it. You'll never again need to spend $3 on a brownie at the coffee shop, or $5 on a pack of cookies at the store. Instead, for instance, I'm going to show you how to make 12 amazing Paleo chocolate brownies in under 30 minutes, how to make a batch of Paleo butter cookies in less than 20 minutes, and other recipes in less than 5 minutes!.
