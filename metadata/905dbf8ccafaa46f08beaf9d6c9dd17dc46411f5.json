He studied plant pathology and spent several years working as a customs inspector in Yokohama. While working there, at the age of 25, he had an inspiration that changed his life. He decided to quit his job, return to his home village and put his ideas into practice by applying them to agriculture.\n\nOver the next 65 years he worked to develop a system of natural farming that demonstrated the insight he was given as a young man, believing that it could be of great benefit to the world. He did not plow his fields, used no agricultural chemicals or prepared fertilizers, did not flood his rice fields as farmers have done in Asia for centuries, and yet his yields equaled or surpassed the most productive farms in Japan.\n\nTranslation by Bill Mollison","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:905dbf8ccafaa46f08beaf9d6c9dd17dc46411f5","amp;dn":"Fukuoka+-+The+One+Straw+Revolution+and+The+Natural+Way+of+Farmin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"905dbf8ccafaa46f08beaf9d6c9dd17dc46411f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,93,191,140,202,250,164,111,8,190,175,157,108,157,209,125,196,100,17,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
