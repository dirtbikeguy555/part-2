They find books, movies, jobs, and dates for us, manage our investments, and discover new drugs. More and more, these algorithms work by learning from the trails of data we leave in our newly digital world. Like curious children, they observe us, imitate, and experiment. And in the worldâ€™s top research labs and universities, the race is on to invent the ultimate learning algorithm: one capable of discovering any knowledge from data, and doing anything we want, before we even ask.Machine learning is the automation of discoveryâ€”the scientific method on steroidsâ€”that enables intelligent robots and computers to program themselves","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdd61fb9f81acc5e3198d8434e4df8ce506ffc83","amp;dn":"The+Master+Algorithm%3A+How+the+Quest+for+the+Ultimate+Learning","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdd61fb9f81acc5e3198d8434e4df8ce506ffc83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,214,31,185,248,26,204,94,49,152,216,67,78,77,248,206,80,111,252,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
