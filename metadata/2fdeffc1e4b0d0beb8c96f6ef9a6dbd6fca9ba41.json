The book was published in 1995, four years after the release of the last Star Trek motion picture starring the entire original cast, and covers the majority of Nimoy's time with Star Trek in general and Mr. Spock in particular. The book's title was a reference to the first volume of his autobiography, I Am Not Spock, which had been published in 1975. At that time Nimoy had sought to distance his own personality from that of the character of Spock, although he nonetheless remained proud of his time on the show. Negative fan reaction to the title gave Nimoy the idea for the title of the second volume.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fdeffc1e4b0d0beb8c96f6ef9a6dbd6fca9ba41","amp;dn":"I+Am+Spock+-+Leonard+Nimoy+1995+%5Bmp3+AUDIO+read+by+Nimoy%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fdeffc1e4b0d0beb8c96f6ef9a6dbd6fca9ba41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,222,255,193,228,176,208,190,184,201,111,110,249,166,219,214,252,169,186,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
