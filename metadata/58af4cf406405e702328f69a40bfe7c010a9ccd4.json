In an elegant silver and black slipcover, the three slimline 2-CD jewel \ncases include holographic cover art that matches that on the DVD cases, a collectible poster/track \nlist, and the scores on newly remastered Digital Stream Discs (which have improved sound quality \nand clarity, especially on top-of-the-line stereos) , as well as exclusive screensavers accessible \nthrough Sony Classical's Star Wars web page.\n\nAs expected, John Williams' music for A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi \nis brilliantly performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. With 74 tracks and over six hours of music, \nthis six-CD set is arguably the most complete collection of original soundtrack material yet released.\n\nIf you own the 1997 RCA Victor Special Edition soundtracks, however, there is no new unreleased \nmaterial here. Indeed, track sequences and titles are identical, and there are no detailed program notes.\n\n\n\nAudio File Information, Properties And Specifications\n\nArtist / Group: John Williams\nAlbum: Star Wars Trilogy Remastered Box Set\nGenre: Soundtrack / Classical / Film Score\nSource: 6 x CD Box Set\nAlbum Release Year.: 2004\nLabel: Sony BMG / Sony Classical\nBarcode: 5099709345128\nNumber of Tracks: 74\nTotal Duration: 6:18:15\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File Formats: FLAC Lossless and MP3\nCodec Version [FLAC]: libFLAC 1.2.1\nCodec Version [MP3]: LAME 3.99r\nEncoding Bit Rate [FLAC]: 685 kbps (Average Bit Rate)\nEncoding Bit Rate [MP3]: 320 kbps (Constant Bit Rate)\nNumber of Audio Channels: 2 (Stereo)\nAudio Quality: 16 bit / 44100 kHz\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File ID Tags: VorbisComment\nIncluded Artwork: Scans (Plus Embedded Artwork Within FLAC / MP3 Files)\nTag / Artwork Editor: Mp3tag v2.58\nAdditional Files: LOG, CUE Sheets, MD5, FFP, SFV, Foo dr and M3U\nTotal File Size: 2.89 GB\nEncoder: BSW\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagecurl.org/images/21462918196379656489.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagecurl.org/images/21462918196379656489.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\nEpisode IV: A New Hope (CD1)\n\n01. 20th Century Fox Fanfare 00:22\n02.
