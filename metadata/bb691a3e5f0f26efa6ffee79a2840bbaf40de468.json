It is the early 1970s and the family's trajectory is upwardly mobile: the future seems limitless. In painstaking, sometimes self-lacerating detail, Karl Ove Knausgaard paints a world familiar to anyone who can recall the intensity and novelty of childhood experience, one in which children and adults lead parallel lives that never meet. Perhaps the most Proustian in the series, My Struggle: Book 3 gives us Knausgaard's vivid, technicolor recollections of childhood, his emerging self-understanding, and the multilayered nature of time's passing, memory, and existence.\n\n----\n\nThanks to the original uploader.\n\n----\n\nBooks 1 and 2 are here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10265951&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10265951&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb691a3e5f0f26efa6ffee79a2840bbaf40de468","amp;dn":"Karl+Ove+Knausgaard+-+My+Struggle%2C+Book+3+%28epub%2C+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb691a3e5f0f26efa6ffee79a2840bbaf40de468","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,105,26,62,95,15,38,239,166,255,238,121,162,132,11,186,244,13,228,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
