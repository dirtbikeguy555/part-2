A haunting, deeply personal collection of impressionistic folk styled epics recorded by an all star jazz backing unit, its poetic complexity earned critical raves. It is included on Rolling StoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“500 Greatest Albums of All Time,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ MOJOÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“100 Best AlbumsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and NMEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Greatest Albums of All Time.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Standouts include Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sweet Thing,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cyprus AvenueÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Way Young Lovers DoÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\n\n \n\n\nAstral Weeks is generally considered one of the best albums in pop music history. For all that renown, Astral Weeks is anything but an archetypal rock &amp; roll album: in fact, it isn't a rock &amp; roll album at all. Employing a mixture of folk, blues, jazz, and classical music, Van Morrison spins out a series of extended ruminations on his Belfast upbringing, including the remarkable character &quot;Madame George&quot; and the climactic epiphany experienced on &quot;Cyprus Avenue.&quot; Accompanying himself on acoustic guitar, Morrison sings in his elastic, bluesy voice, accompanied by a jazz rhythm section (Jay Berliner, guitar, Richard Davis, bass, Connie Kay, drums), plus reeds (John Payne) and vibes (Warren Smith, Jr.), with a string quartet overdubbed. An emotional outpouring cast in delicate musical structures, Astral Weeks has a unique musical power. Unlike any record before or since, it nevertheless encompasses the passion and tenderness that have always mixed in the best postwar popular music, easily justifying the critics' raves.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - Astral Weeks\n 02 - Beside You\n 03 - Sweet Thing\n 04 - Cyprus Avenue\n 05 - The Way Young Lovers Do\n 06 - Madame George\n 07 - Ballerina\n 08 - Slim Slow Slider\n\n\n\nVan Morrison - His Band And The Street Choir (1970/2013)\n FLAC (tracks) 24 bit/192 kHz | Time - 42:37 minutes | 1,77 GB\nOfficial Digital Download - Source: HDTracks.com | Front cover\n\n His Band And The Street Choir features the top single &quot;Domino,&quot; which continues to be Van Morrison's most successful single within his solo career. The album also includes classics &quot;Give Me A Kiss,&quot; &quot;Call Me Up in Dreamland&quot; and &quot;Blue Money.&quot; Compared to Morrison's preceeding hit album Moondance, His Band And Street Choir evokes a more relaxed sound.\n After the brilliant one-two punch of Astral Weeks and Moondance, His Band and the Street Choir brings Van Morrison back down to earth, both literally and figuratively. While neither as innovative nor as edgy as its predecessors, His Band and the Street Choir also lacks their overt mysticism; at heart, the album is simply Morrison's valentine to the R&amp;B that inspired him, resulting in the muscular and joyous tribute &quot;Domino&quot; as well as the bouncy &quot;Blue Money&quot; and &quot;Call Me Up in Dreamland&quot;.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - Domino\n 02 - Crazy Face\n 03 - Give Me A Kiss\n 04 - I've Been Working\n 05 - Call Me Up In Dreamland\n 06 - I'll Be Your Lover, Too\n 07 - Blue Money\n 08 - Virgo Clowns\n 09 - Gypsy Queen\n 10 - Sweet Jannie\n 11 - If I Ever Needed Someone\n 12 - Street Choir\n\n\nVan Morrison - Moondance (1970/2013)\n FLAC (tracks) 24 bit/192 kHz | Time - 38:56 minutes | 1,47 GB\nOfficial Digital Download - Source: HDTracks.com | Front cover\n\n In the fall of 1969, Van Morrison entered the studio to record Moondance, the album that would soon become his commercial breakthrough and one of the most beloved recordings of all time. This re-release is a high-resolution stereo remaster by the original album engineer Elliot Scheiner.\n The yang to Astral Weeks' yin, the brilliant Moondance is every bit as much a classic as its predecessor; Van Morrison's first commercially successful solo effort, it retains the previous album's deeply spiritual thrust but transcends its bleak, cathartic intensity to instead explore themes of renewal and redemption. Light, soulful, and jazzy, Moondance opens with the sweetly nostalgic &quot;And It Stoned Me,&quot; the song's pastoral imagery establishing the dominant lyrical motif recurring throughout the album -- virtually every track exults in natural wonder, whether it's the nocturnal magic celebrated by the title cut or the unlimited promise offered in &quot;Brand New Day.&quot; At the heart of the record is &quot;Caravan,&quot; an incantatory ode to the power of radio; equally stirring is the majestic &quot;Into the Mystic,&quot; a song of such elemental beauty and grace as to stand as arguably the quintessential Morrison moment.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - And It Stoned Me\n 02 - Moondance\n 03 - Crazy Love\n 04 - Caravan\n 05 - Into The Mystic\n 06 - Come Running\n 07 - These Dreams Of You\n 08 - Brand New Day\n 09 - Everyone\n 10 - Glad Tidings\n\n\nVan Morrison - Inarticulate Speech Of The Heart (1983/2013)\n FLAC (tracks) 24 bit/192 kHz | Time - 47:26 minutes | 1,76 GB\nOfficial Digital Download - Source: HDTracks.com | Front cover\n\n Inarticulate Speech Of The Heart is Van MorrisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1983 classic. His final album for Warner Bros. Records is a primarily instrumental affair. It features MorrisonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trademark airy arrangements and mystical themes. Standouts include Ã¢â‚¬Å“River Of Time,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Higher Than The WorldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the title-track. It reached the Top Twenty-five in the U.K. This definitive outing is a magnificent blend of rock and Celtic melodies. Absolutely essential.\n Almost a forgotten album, Inarticulate Speech of the Heart takes listeners to the deepest, most inward areas of Van Morrison's renegade Irish soul, the culmination of his spiritual jazz period and also -- perhaps not coincidentally -- the last record he made for Warner Bros. Four of the 11 tracks are moody instrumentals, which might partly explain the indifference of many rock critics toward the album, although the album's very title gives a clue to their presence. The mood is predominantly mellow but never flaccid or complacent; there is a radiance that glows throughout. &quot;Higher Than the World&quot; is simply one of the most beautiful recordings Morrison ever made, with Mark Isham's choir-like synthesizer laying down the lovely backdrop. The instrumental &quot;Connswater&quot; is the most Irish-flavored piece that Morrison had made up to that point, and would continue to be until he recorded with the Chieftains in 1988. &quot;Rave on, John Donne&quot; -- in part a recitation invoking a roster of writers over a supple two-chord vamp -- seems to have had the longest afterlife, reappearing in Morrison's live shows and greatest-hits compilations. &quot;The Street Only Knew Your Name&quot; is the only piece that could be classified as a rocker, tempered even here by the synthesizer overlays. The record sold poorly, but many of those who bought it consider it one of the most cherished items in their Van Morrison collections.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - Higher Than The World\n 02 - Connswater\n 03 - River Of Time\n 04 - Celtic Swing\n 05 - Rave On, John Donne\n 06 - Inarticulate Speech Of The Heart, No. 1\n 07 - Irish Heartbeat\n 08 - The Street Only Knew Your Name\n 09 - Cry For Home\n 10 - Inarticulate Speech Of The Heart, No. 2\n 11 - September Night\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7374e873c89cfc31d8d3c61ac658df8a75d2989a","amp;dn":"Van+Morrison+4+Albums+1968-1982+24bit-192khz+HDTRACKS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7374e873c89cfc31d8d3c61ac658df8a75d2989a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,116,232,115,200,156,252,49,216,211,198,26,198,88,223,138,117,210,152,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
