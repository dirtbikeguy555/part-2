Again.\n\nNo matter what he does or the decisions he makes, when death comes, Harry always returns to where he began, a child with all the knowledge of a life he has already lived a dozen times before. Nothing ever changes.\n\nUntil now.\n\nAs Harry nears the end of his eleventh life, a little girl appears at his bedside. 'I nearly missed you, Doctor August,' she says. 'I need to send a message.'\n\nThis is the story of what Harry does next, and what he did before, and how he tries to save a past he cannot change and a future he cannot allow.\n\n\nRead by Peter Kenny\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07e7c1b6aaf5869fe2f46d6b05c06203f463309c","amp;dn":"Claire+North+-+The+First+Fifteen+Lives+of+Harry+August","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07e7c1b6aaf5869fe2f46d6b05c06203f463309c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,231,193,182,170,245,134,159,226,244,109,107,5,192,98,3,244,99,48,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
