ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a homage to the hometown of this extravagant and magical band: \n&quot;When we all moved to Berlin independently we wanted to do something new. \nWeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re all different and we have different origins but we made it to create something together. I think that the sense of life of Berlin has influenced us a lot. \nSo itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a perfectly fitting album title,&quot; the gigantic drummer Tiger logicaly states. \nThe long time, which KADAVAR spend on the road and follow their vocation, naturally leaves marks and unavoidably flows into the new material. \nSinger and guitarist Lupus continues: \n&quot;You are sitting in the bus and drive around through the landscape for months, you look out of the window and see how life runs over. \nThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no place for princesses. \nYour individual needs donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t matter. The only thing which matters, is the project itself.&quot; Damn Right sounds like a band that's gonna go far.\n\nCountry: Germany\nGenre: Stoner / Hard rock\nQuality: Mp3, CBR 320 kbps\nRelease Date: Aug 21, 2015\ninfo \n\n\nTracklisting\n\n1.
