Psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, Norman Doidge, M.D., traveled the country to meet both the brilliant scientists championing neuroplasticity and the people whose lives theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve transformedÃ¢â‚¬â€people whose mental limitations or brain damage were seen as unalterable. We see a woman born with half a brain that rewired itself to work as a whole, blind people who learn to see, learning disorders cured, IQs raised, aging brains rejuvenated, stroke patients learning to speak, children with cerebral palsy learning to move with more grace, depression and anxiety disorders successfully treated, and lifelong character traits changed. Using these marvelous stories to probe mysteries of the body, emotion, love, sex, culture, and education, Dr. Doidge has written an immensely moving, inspiring book that will permanently alter the way we look at our brains, human nature, and human potential.&quot;\n\nThe New York Times:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The power of positive thinking finally gains scientific credibility. Mind-bending, miracle-making, reality-busting stuff...with implications for all human beings, not to mention human culture, human learning and human history.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n** Big thanks to Ekolb's original torrent for this book. http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4539723/The_Brain_that_Changes_Itself-CBC_TNOT_11-27-2008_Ekolb\n\nIt had many translation errors.
