In this unconventional introduction, physicist Leonard Susskind and hacker-scientist George Hrabovsky offer a first course in physics and associated math for the ardent amateur. Unlike most popular physics booksÃ¢â‚¬â€which give readers a taste of what physicists know but shy away from equations or mathÃ¢â‚¬â€Susskind and Hrabovsky actually teach the skills you need to do physics, beginning with classical mechanics, yourself. Based on SusskindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enormously popular Stanford University-based (and YouTube-featured) continuing-education course, the authors cover the minimumÃ¢â‚¬â€the theoretical minimum of the titleÃ¢â‚¬â€that readers need to master to study more advanced topics.\n\nAn alternative to the conventional go-to-college method, The Theoretical Minimum provides a tool kit for amateur scientists to learn physics at their own pace.
