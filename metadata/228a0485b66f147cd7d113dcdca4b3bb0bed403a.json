What Roy, a veteran of the grift, and Frank, his ambitious protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ©, are swindling these days are &quot;water filtration systems,&quot; bargain-basement water filters bought by unsuspecting people who pay ten times their value in order to win bogus prizes like cars, jewelry and overseas vacations--which they never collect. These scams net the flim-flam men a few hundred here, another thousand there, which eventually adds up to a lucrative partnership. Roy&amp;#039;s private life, however, is not so successful. An obsessive-compulsive agoraphobe with no personal relationships to call his own, Roy is barely hanging on to his wits, and when his idiosyncrasies begin to threaten his criminal productivity he&amp;#039;s forced to seek the help of a psychoanalyst just to keep him in working order. While Roy is looking for a quick fix, his therapy begets more than he bargained for: the revelation that he has a teenage daughter--a child whose existence he suspected but never dared confirm. What&amp;#039;s more troubling, 14-year-old Angela wants to meet the father she never knew. At first, Angela&amp;#039;s appearance disrupts her neurotic father&amp;#039;s carefully ordered routine. Soon, however, with his own unique spin on parenthood, Roy begins to enjoy a relationship he never dreamed of having with his daughter. But while he develops paternal feelings for the 14-year-old, she&amp;#039;s developing a fascination with Daddy&amp;#039;s questionable career.\n\nCast\n\nRoy Waller (Nicolas Cage)\nFrank Mercer(Sam Rockwell)\nAngela (Alison Lohman)\nDr. Klein (Bruce Altman)\nChuck Frechette (Bruce McGill)\nMrs. Schaffer (Jenny O&amp;#039;Hara)\nMr. Schaffer (Steve Eastin)\nLaundry Lady (Beth Grant)\nKathy (Sheila Kelley)\nSlacker Boyfriend (Fran Kranz)\nBishop (Tim Kelleher)\nHolt (Nigel Gibbs)\nPharmacist #1 (Bill Saito)\nPharmacist #2 (Tim Maculan)\nMan in Line (Stoney Westmoreland)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:228a0485b66f147cd7d113dcdca4b3bb0bed403a","amp;dn":"Matchstick+Men+2003+DVDRip+XviD+AR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"228a0485b66f147cd7d113dcdca4b3bb0bed403a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,138,4,133,182,111,20,124,215,209,19,220,220,164,179,187,11,237,64,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
