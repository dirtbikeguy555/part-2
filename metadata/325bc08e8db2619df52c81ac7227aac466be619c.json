Beginning with 4-beat programmed loops and breakbeats etc, his interest in producing music started to grow. It almost became an obsession, and in the same addictive way as a crack junk smokes his dope, Danny worked on his music day and night. Always searching for improvement and development, his music became more and more professional. What first started out as connecting some loops into a track, slowly turned into serious hardcore house.\n\nIn the beginning of 2001 he decided to send a demo to BZRK Records. The well known record label, owned by Mark Vos (Buzz Fuzz). He listened to the demo, and decided he wanted to do serious buzzinezz with Danny. After a while of some mastering and editing, BZRK 33 was born. Under the alias Menace II Society the ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Son Of A Bitch EPÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ entered the market. Almost at the same time, the first ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Angerfist EPÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ was released on Overload Records. This was the first time, the name Angerfist appeared in the hardcore scene. Tracks as ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Criminally InsaneÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ and ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Fuck OffÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ were immediately recognized as relatively big hits by the public. Danny had set foot in the scene.\n\nJust a little while later, he released another record, under the name Kid Morbid. This MOH 027 release was also played a lot by DJ's. After this rush of records, his name was pretty well known. Now, 2 years later, people know his tracks and appreciate his style. Deep raw kicks, and uplifting melodies still punish the eardrums of party people around the world. He is dedicated to keep on making slamming hardcore house...\n\nDanny changed his way of performing. In December 2005 he announced that he would face the wheels of steel on Masters of Hardcore 2006 (held on the 18th of February) as a DJ and not as a live performer.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThis torrent basically contains all of Angerfist's tracks. Some or not really from him because some people named different tracks to Angerfist tracks. I tried to delete most of those but I wasn't sure for some tracks. However I did tried to make this discography as complete as possible, using DiscoGs and other sites.\n\nThe tracks included:\n\nCriminally Insane (12&quot;)\nBreakin' Down Society EP (12&quot;, EP)\nSons Of Satan E.P. (12&quot;, EP)\nRaise Your Fist EP (12&quot;, EP)\nBroken Chain EP (12&quot;, EP)\nPissin' Razorbladez (2xCD, Album)\nTowards Isolation (2x12&quot;, Ltd)\nAlles Kut Enter (12&quot;)\nMutilate (2xCD, Album)\nMutilate E.P. (12&quot;, EP)\n\n+ a lot of stuff I got from limewire and gabber.od.ua. Also a lot of Never Released Tracks are included.\n\nI hope you all will enjoy this music as much as I do.
