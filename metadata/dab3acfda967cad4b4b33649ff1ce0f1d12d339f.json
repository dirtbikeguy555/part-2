But decreasing or changing the sugar in a recipe can have disastrous results: Baked goods turn out dry, dense, and downright inedible. We address these issues head-on with 120 foolproof, great-tasting recipes for cookies, cakes, pies and more that reduce the overall sugar content by at least 30% and rely solely on more natural alternatives to white sugar","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dab3acfda967cad4b4b33649ff1ce0f1d12d339f","amp;dn":"Naturally+Sweet++-+Less+Sugar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dab3acfda967cad4b4b33649ff1ce0f1d12d339f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,179,172,253,169,103,202,212,180,179,54,73,255,28,224,241,209,45,51,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
