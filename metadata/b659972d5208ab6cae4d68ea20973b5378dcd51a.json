A football match still\nruns properly.\nIs there someone knowing any solutions. Pleazzzz inform me. Thank a lot.\n(Just replying or PM)\n\nThe Setup CDs are not genuine. You need the crack that is already included.\nYou should use SafeDisc v2.9 Method to write the (spurious) CD2 despite\nit is not genuine.\n\nThe main gateway of Thailand significantly reduces any international\nbittorrent&amp;#039;s bandwidth.
