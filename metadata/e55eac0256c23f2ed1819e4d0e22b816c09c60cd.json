The Kingdom of Armello is as dangerous as it is beautiful, perils, banes and bandits hide around every corner and a spreading corruption known as the rot is leaving no creature untouched.\r\nArmello is League of Geeksâ€™ attempt to revolutionise digital board and card games, whilst providing players a rich world within which they can craft their own stories of epic adventure. The aim was to create a rich game full of backstabbing, close shaves, shattered alliances, ruses and empty promises - a perfect game to play with your friends.\r\nEasy to Play but Hard to Master - Armello is an intuitive game, easy to pick up and experience but with deep and emergent strategy. Full release will include a tutorial mode.\r\nFast &amp; Thoughtful - Adventuring in Armello is fast-paced fun but filled with deadly tactical and politically complex decisions requiring careful forethought and planning.\r\nMultiple Playable Heroes - Full release will include 8 playable Heroes. Each unique Hero possess a special power, stat line and Ai personality. Also heroes can be customised with Amulet and Signet Ring load-outs to match your play style or counter an opponents strategy.\r\nDynamic Sandbox - Armello features a gorgeous dynamic world which procedurally generates a new map each and every game, complete with a dynamic quest system ensuring no two games of Armello are ever the same.\r\nTurn-Based Day &amp; Night Cycle - Armello features a fuzzy turn-based system, cycling between Day and Night phases. The fuzzy turns allow you to still play cards and do certain actions when its not your turn, and when it is you use Action Points to move around the hex board.\r\nWorld Class Music &amp; Audio - By Michael Allen, internationally acclaimed artist Lisa Gerrard, and Jacek Tuschewski.\r\nAnimated Cards - Armello will feature over a 120+ beautifully animated in-game Cards, from artists all over the world.\r\nTrue Tabletop Feel - We spent months making sure we cherry-picked the best parts of the tabletop experience, like our custom physics-based dice!\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: Windows 7 (32-bit)\r\nProcessor: Dual-core 2.0 GHz \r\nMemory: 2 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: DirectX 10 class GPU with 512MB VRAM \r\nDirectX: Version 9.0c \r\nHard Drive: 4 GB available space\r\n\r\nRecommended system requirements - Windows: Windows 7 or later (64-bit) \r\nProcessor: Quad-core 2.5GHz \r\nMemory: 4 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: DirectX 11 class GPU with 1GB VRAM \r\nDirectX: Version 9.0c \r\nHard Drive: 4 GB available space","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e55eac0256c23f2ed1819e4d0e22b816c09c60cd","amp;dn":"Armello+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e55eac0256c23f2ed1819e4d0e22b816c09c60cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,94,172,2,86,194,63,46,209,129,158,77,14,34,184,22,192,156,96,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
