With Paul McCartney, Lennon formed one of the most influential and successful songwriting partnerships of the 20th century and &quot;wrote some of the most popular music in rock and roll history&quot;. He is ranked the second most successful songwriter in U.K. singles chart history after McCartney.\n\nLennon revealed a rebellious nature, and biting wit, in his music, on film, in books, and at press conferences and interviews. He was controversial through his work as a peace activist and artist. After The Beatles, Lennon enjoyed a successful solo career with such acclaimed albums as John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Imagine and iconic songs such as &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; and &quot;Imagine&quot;. After a self-imposed &quot;retirement&quot; from 1976 to 1980, Lennon reemerged with a comeback album, Double Fantasy, but was murdered less than one month after its release. The album would go on to win the 1981 Grammy Award for Album of the Year.\n\nIn 2002, respondents to a BBC poll on the 100 Greatest Britons voted Lennon eighth. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked Lennon number 38 on its list of &quot;The Immortals: The Fifty Greatest Artists of All Time&quot; (The Beatles being number one). He was also ranked fifth greatest singer of all time by Rolling Stone in 2008. He was posthumously inducted into both the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.\n\n01 Give Peace a Chance.mp3 (5.61 megabyte)\n02 Instant Karma!.mp3 (3.87 megabyte)\n03 Power to the People.mp3 (3.79 megabyte)\n04 Whatever Gets You Thru the Night.mp3 (3.82 megabyte)\n05 #9 Dream.mp3 (5.51 megabyte)\n06 Mind Games.mp3 (4.86 megabyte)\n07 Love.mp3 (3.9 megabyte)\n08 Happy Xmas (War Is Over).mp3 (4.12 megabyte)\n09 Imagine.mp3 (3.53 megabyte)\n10 Jealous Guy.mp3 (4.92 megabyte)\n11 Stand by Me.mp3 (3.96 megabyte)\n12 (Just Like) Starting Over.mp3 (4.53 megabyte)\n13 Woman.mp3 (3.97 megabyte)\n14 I'm Losing You.mp3 (4.58 megabyte)\n15 Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy).mp3 (4.65 megabyte)\n16 Watching the Wheels.mp3 (4.08 megabyte)\n17 Dear Yoko.mp3 (2.97 megabyte)\n18 Move Over Ms. L.mp3 (3.41 megabyte)\n19 Cold Turkey.mp3 (5.74 megabyte)\nLennon - Back.jpg (375.5 kilobyte)\nLennon - Front.jpg (277.89 kilobyte)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79f329841e18ab348614e684d5e348fb7d87f05d","amp;dn":"John+Lennon+-+Greatest+Hits+%5BCollection%5D++With+Covers+%5BBubanee%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79f329841e18ab348614e684d5e348fb7d87f05d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,243,41,132,30,24,171,52,134,20,230,132,213,227,72,251,125,135,240,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
