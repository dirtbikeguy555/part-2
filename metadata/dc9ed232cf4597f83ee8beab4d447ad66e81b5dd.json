There isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a lot of 12-bar on this album if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a purist about such things, but the tone of this music is smoky and rich like a Deep South BBQ joint, which suits the gruff texture of HiattÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice just fine, and the rootsy mood of the songs is reinforced by the production and arrangements. Hiatt primarily plays acoustic guitar on Terms of my Surrender, which cuts back the volume of these performances but adds a lot to the slinky middle-of-the-night groove of the music; Doug Lancio, lead guitarist with HiattÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s road band the Combo, produced this album, and the results sound organic and spontaneous, more so than his previous albumsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nwith producer Kevin Shirley, without obscuring the easy precision of Hiatt and his bandmates. The interplay of the band is solid, with Nathan GehriÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bass and Kenneth BlevinsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ drums resting comfortably in the pocket as Hiatt and Lancio conjure ghostly melodies with their guitars. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Here to StayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Nothing I LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are simple but effective blues-based numbers that deal with the tough side of love, while Ã¢â‚¬Å“MarleneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Come Back HomeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are more cheerful variations on similar themes, and the quality of the songwriting here once again serves as a reminder of just how good Hiatt is Ã¢â‚¬â€ this is a guy who can crank out an album of new material every couple years, and he always delivers a handful of real gems without sounding rote, whether heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sounding ominous on Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Wind DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Have to HurryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ or offering snarky humor on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Old People.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ On Terms of my Surrender, Hiatt has the blues, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got the goods, and this is another solid chapter in a recording career thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drifted into an unexpected but pleasing renaissance.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc9ed232cf4597f83ee8beab4d447ad66e81b5dd","amp;dn":"John+Hiatt+-+Terms+of+My+Surrender+%282014%29+MP3VBR+Beolab1700","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc9ed232cf4597f83ee8beab4d447ad66e81b5dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,158,210,50,207,69,151,248,62,232,190,171,77,68,122,214,110,129,181,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
