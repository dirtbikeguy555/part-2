Wolff &amp; Stephen A. Resnick,\r\n \r\nContending Economic Theories offers a unique comparative treatment of the three main theories in economics as it is taught today: neoclassical, Keynesian, and Marxian. Each is developed and discussed in its own chapter, yet also differentiated from and compared to the other two theories. The authors identify each theoryâ€™s starting point, its goals and foci, and its internal logic.\r\n \r\nThe authors, building on their earlier book Economics: Marxian versus Neoclassical, offer an expanded treatment of Keynesian economics and a comprehensive introduction to Marxian economics, including its class analysis of society. Beyond providing a systematic explanation of the logic and structure of standard neoclassical theory, they analyze re- cent extensions and developments of that theory around such topics as market imperfections, information economics, new theories of equilibrium, and behavioral economics, considering whether these advances represent new paradigms or merely adjustments to the standard theory. They also explain why economic reasoning has varied among these three approaches throughout the twentieth century, and why this variation continues todayâ€”as neoclassical views give way to new Keynesian approaches in the wake of the economic collapse of 2008.\r\n\r\nIf you want to support the authors:  \nhttp://www.rdwolff.com/books#contendingecontheories","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adfe09633086a3367aa73d802fed684db9c20dc5","amp;dn":"Contending+Economic+Theories+-+Richard+Wolff+Stephen+Resnick+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adfe09633086a3367aa73d802fed684db9c20dc5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,254,9,99,48,134,163,54,122,167,61,128,47,237,104,77,185,194,13,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
