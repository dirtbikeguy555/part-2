These files may be a little large for some.  But if you aren't worried about space, and want a higher quality, then this is for you.  I've previewed the episodes and they look and sound great on a 50 inch lcd/surround sound system.\n\nStargate SG-1\nSeason 1, episodes 1-22\n\nSource: DVD Rip\nAverage File Size: 600mb\n\nContainer: MKV\nVideo: x264\nAudio: English ac3 passthrough-Dolby Digital, Spanish, French\n\nSubtitles: English srt (in MKV)\n\n\nPlease seed when you are done...I good rule of thumb is to upload at least as much as you've downloaded...thanks!!\n\n\np.s. I used subtitles that I found online.  I did perform spot checks, however I can't guarantee the accuracy of the subs since I didn't rip them myself.  Thanks to those who did.\n\np.s.s. ATT PS3 MEDIA SERVER (which I use for these) USERS : Make sure to disable ASS/SSA Subtitles.  Also, these files may not work properly with TSMuxer...use the MEncoder engine(default) instead. Also if using MEncoder, if you have problems with audio sync, try unchecking AV/Sync Alternative Method.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a913ae6f7f1bf7a64d50d2a5ea6efc44a1086d80","amp;dn":"Stargate.SG-1.Season.1.x264.ac3.subs-HighQuality","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a913ae6f7f1bf7a64d50d2a5ea6efc44a1086d80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,19,174,111,127,27,247,166,77,80,210,165,234,110,252,68,161,8,109,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
