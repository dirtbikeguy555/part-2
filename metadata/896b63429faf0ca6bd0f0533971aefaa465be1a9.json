One does not envy John Updike the agonizing task of choosing the best of the best--the most enduring stories from the 84 annual volumes published through 1999. Happily, he ably fielded the challenge, selecting the work of authors running the gamut from F. Scott Fitzgerald and Sherwood Anderson to Tim O'Brien and Lorrie Moore. Late authors are read by other writers; living authors read their own works.\n\nCynthia Ozick's 2,000-word masterpiece of the Holocaust, &quot;The Shawl,&quot; combines stark brutality with story elements that border on magical realism. Ozick's flat, unrelenting reading, in a tone that echoes the very experience of physical and spiritual starvation, sears this story into one's soul. \n\nRosellen Brown, who often writes of love and dysfunction in family life, reads &quot;How to Win,&quot; a mother's perspective on her clinically hyperactive child. (Anyone thinking of becoming a new parent should either avoid this story--or listen to it right away.) Brown reads with the intensity of one trying to bridge the unfathomable distance among us all--even mother and child. \n -AudioFile 2001","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:896b63429faf0ca6bd0f0533971aefaa465be1a9","amp;dn":"THE+BEST+AMERICAN+SHORT+STORIES+OF+THE+CENTURY+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"896b63429faf0ca6bd0f0533971aefaa465be1a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,107,99,66,159,175,12,166,189,15,5,51,151,26,239,170,70,91,225,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
