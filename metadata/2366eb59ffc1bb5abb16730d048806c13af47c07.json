Two years into the harrowing voyage, the Jeannette's hull was breached by an impassable stretch of pack ice, forcing the crew to abandon ship amid torrents of rushing of water. Hours later, the ship had sunk below the surface, marooning the men a thousand miles north of Siberia, where they faced a terrifying march with minimal supplies across the endless ice pack. \r\n\r\nEnduring everything from snow blindness and polar bears to ferocious storms and labyrinths of ice, the crew battled madness and starvation as they struggled desperately to survive. With thrilling twists and turns, In The Kingdom of Ice is a spellbinding tale of heroism and determination in one of the most brutal places on Earth","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2366eb59ffc1bb5abb16730d048806c13af47c07","amp;dn":"In+the+Kingdom+of+Ice%3A+The+Polar+Voyage+of+the+USS+Jeannette","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2366eb59ffc1bb5abb16730d048806c13af47c07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,102,235,89,255,193,187,90,187,22,115,13,4,136,6,193,58,244,124,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
