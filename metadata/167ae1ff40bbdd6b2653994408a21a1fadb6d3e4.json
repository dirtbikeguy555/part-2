My only complaint is that they include a shortened version of Maybe. Then don't sing the second verse of the song. You never hear &quot;betcha he reads, betcha she sews, maybe she's made me a closet of clothes...&quot; and the climatic end of the song. My 4 year old and I were both so disappointed that this was done. I can't image they were short on space on the cd. My daughter and I sing that verse all the time and we couldn't believe when we put the cd in, played the song, and then it ended so abruptly. I just don't understand. Other than that, the song selection is awesome and this version of the movie was by far the best made.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:167ae1ff40bbdd6b2653994408a21a1fadb6d3e4","amp;dn":"Annie+%281982+film+cast%29+-+Original+Motion+Picture+Soundtrack+-+FL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"167ae1ff40bbdd6b2653994408a21a1fadb6d3e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,122,225,255,64,187,221,107,38,83,153,68,8,162,26,31,173,182,211,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
