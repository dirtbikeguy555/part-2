Despite the most advanced medical technology in the world, we are sicker than ever by nearly every measure.\n\nTwo out of every three of us are overweight. Cases of diabetes are exploding, especially amongst our younger population. About half of us are taking at least one prescription drug. Major medical operations have become routine, helping to drive health care costs to astronomical levels. Heart disease, cancer and stroke are the country's three leading causes of death, even though billions are spent each year to &quot;battle&quot; these very conditions. Millions suffer from a host of other degenerative diseases.\n\nFORKS OVER KNIVES examines the profound claim that most, if not all, of the so-called &quot;diseases of affluence&quot; that afflict us can be controlled, or even reversed, by rejecting our present menu of animal-based and processed foods. The major storyline in the film traces the personal journeys of a pair of pioneering yet under-appreciated researchers, Dr. T. Colin Campbell and Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn.\n\nThe idea of food as medicine is put to the test. Throughout the film, cameras follow &quot;reality patients&quot; who have chronic conditions from heart disease to diabetes. Doctors teach these patients how to adopt a whole foods plant-based diet as the primary approach to treat their ailments - while the challenges and triumphs of their journeys are revealed.\n\nFORKS OVER KNIVES utilizes state of the art 3-D graphics and rare archival footage. The film features leading experts on health, examines the question &quot;why we don't know&quot;, and tackles the issue of diet and disease in a way that will have people talking for years.\n\nFORKS OVER KNIVES was filmed all over the United States, and in Canada and China. h.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50cec5c31124247db3afc7f488180fbed039ba4e","amp;dn":"Forks+Over+Knives+-+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50cec5c31124247db3afc7f488180fbed039ba4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,206,197,195,17,36,36,125,179,175,199,244,136,24,15,190,208,57,186,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
