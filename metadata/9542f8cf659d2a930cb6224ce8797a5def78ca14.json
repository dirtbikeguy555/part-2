LÃ¥psley came to North America earlier this year, off of the release of her Understudy EP on XL Recordings, and played to sold-out audiences in NYC, Los Angeles and Toronto. She returned to NYC in November to play sold out shows at Rough Trade and Mercury Lounge in which she performed new material from her impending debut album, out March 4th on XL Recordings. â€œHurt Me,â€ LÃ¥psleyâ€™s latest single, further cements her position as a prodigious new talent. To date sheâ€™s garnered â€˜Best New Artistâ€™ mentions from Buzzfeed, NPR, KCRW, Nylon, &amp; Elle.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01. Heatless 4:14\r\n02. Hurt Me 3:51\r\n03. Falling Short 3:23\r\n04.
