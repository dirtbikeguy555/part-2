Breaking records and earning the respect of the Nazi regime, she became the first female Luftwaffe test pilot, earning significant awards and becoming a personal heroine of Hitler's. Reitsch was an ardent Nazi and was prepared to die for the cause, first as a test pilot for the dangerous V1 rockets and later by volunteering for a suggested Nazi &quot;kamikaze&quot; squadron.\r\n\r\nAfter her capture she complained bitterly of not being able to die with her leader, but went on to live a celebrated flying career post-war, breaking more records for gliding. When she died a new mystery was created â€” did Hanna kill herself? Why did she die when she did?\r\n\r\nUsing first-hand material including interviews with Hannah and newly released U.S. interrogation records, this book reveals new facts about the mysterious Hanna and cuts through the many myths that have surrounded her life and death, bringing the fascinating Reitsch back to life for the 21st century","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3dc6c1739b08f2b44e41dc12fad49a0c985b51e","amp;dn":"Hitler%27s+Heroine%3A+Hanna+Reitsch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3dc6c1739b08f2b44e41dc12fad49a0c985b51e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,220,108,23,57,176,143,43,68,228,29,193,47,173,73,160,201,133,181,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
