It portrays the real life events aboard fishing vessels in the Bering Sea during the Alaskan king crab and C. opilio crab fishing seasons.\n\nThe Aleutian Islands port of Dutch Harbor, Alaska, is the base of operations for the fishing fleet. The show's title derives from the inherent high risk of injury or death associated with the work.\n\n\n\nPlot:\n----------\nThe series follows life on &quot;the vast Bering Sea&quot; aboard six crab fishing boats during two of the dangerous crab fishing seasons, the October king crab season and the January opilio crab (C. opilio; often referred to as &quot;snow crab&quot; or &quot;opies&quot;) season. The show emphasizes the real danger on the decks of these boats to the fishermen who ply their trade onboard (and the Discovery Channel camera crews recording their work) as crews duck heavy crab pots swinging into position, maneuver hundreds of pounds of crab across a deck strewn with hazards (i. e., holding tank hatches, uneven surfaces, maintenance access plates, wet decks), and lean over the rails to position pots for launch or retrieval as gale-force winds and high waves constantly lash over the deck. The series also documents the dangers of being on a boat in the Bering Sea, in the midst of some of the coldest and stormiest waters on earth, where even a minor problem may become complex with the nearest port often hundreds of miles away.\n      \n\n\nSpecs:\n----------\nFile Types: Mkv or Matroska Multimedia Container\nVideo Codec: H264 - MPEG-4 AVC(part10)(avc1)\nLanguage: English\nSubtitles: None \nResolution: 1280x720\nFrame Rate: 23.976215\nAudio Codec: A52 Audio  (aka AC3)(a52)\nChanels: 3F2R/LFE\nSample Rate: 48000 Hz\nBitrate: 384 kb/s\nSource: HDTV Rips\nTested with VLC on PC and WDTV Media Player on T.V.\n\n\nActual Screenshots:\n----------  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img266.imageshack.us/img266/6426/45qp.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img266.imageshack.us/img266/6426/45qp.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/4442/1rnv.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img12.imageshack.us/img12/4442/1rnv.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img843.imageshack.us/img843/8509/3alj.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img843.imageshack.us/img843/8509/3alj.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img837.imageshack.us/img837/9817/g3n0.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img837.imageshack.us/img837/9817/g3n0.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img835.imageshack.us/img835/681/5nrg.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img835.imageshack.us/img835/681/5nrg.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img405.imageshack.us/img405/8044/gk7.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img405.imageshack.us/img405/8044/gk7.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nIMDb Link: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446809/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0446809/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOfficial Website: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dsc.discovery.com/tv-shows/deadliest-catch&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dsc.discovery.com/tv-shows/deadliest-catch&lt;/a&gt; \n\nWiki:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadliest_Catch&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadliest_Catch&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nMuch admiration to release groups and encoders such as IMMERSE, EVOLVE, CtrlHD, DHD, YesTV, MVGroup and KiNGS.\n\n\nBackups and other CARG Releases can be found at ExtraTorrent &amp; KickassTorrent\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a484b82099abf285f612c7ed60439e0aeb47614","amp;dn":"Deadliest+Catch+Season+9+Complete+720p+HD+%5BCARG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a484b82099abf285f612c7ed60439e0aeb47614","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,72,75,130,9,154,191,40,95,97,44,126,214,4,57,224,174,180,118,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
