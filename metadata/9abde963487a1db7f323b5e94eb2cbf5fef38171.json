The decadent life of Robert is made of alcohol, cigarettes, and short-time relationships with women; women he interviews for a book, he spends a weekend with at a casino or fall in love with for the fun of an evening. Having no constraints, he his unable to be responsible for anything including the care of his son, leaving him alone in an hotel room and teaching the 12-years old boy how to drink. His life is made of his own phantasms as an artist. His sister is divorcing from her husband because of her exuberant and insane behavior. She scares her daughter Debbie who prefers to stay with her father, a decision that hurts Sarah very deeply and reinforces her nervous breakdown. Most of the movie takes place in the house of Robert. We watch Robert and Sarah struggling with their own lives. As the movie progresses, the house gets empty little by little...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9abde963487a1db7f323b5e94eb2cbf5fef38171","amp;dn":"Love+Streams+%281984%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9abde963487a1db7f323b5e94eb2cbf5fef38171","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,189,233,99,72,122,29,183,243,35,181,233,78,178,203,245,254,243,129,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
