Nidge has his hooks into a client who has fallen behind on his tab at the brothel, and sees an opportunity to extort him into helping to import a large consignment of drugs. But unknown to the gang, his activities have attracted the attention of the gardaÃƒÂ­ in the form of a semi-autonomous squad of secret undercover operatives, headed by Detective Inspector Mick Moynihan. As an increasingly paranoid Nidge works to put together the deal of a lifetime, he's unaware that Moynihan and his team are watching his every move.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 06-Oct-2013\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nVideo\n\nCodec: MPEG-4 Video (XVID)\nResolution: 720x404\nFrame Rate: 25\nDecoded format: Planar 4:2:0 YUV\n\n\n\nAudio\n\nCodec: MPEG Audio layer 1/2/3 (mpga)\nChannels: Stereo\nSample Rate: 48000 Hz\nBitrate: 128 kb/s","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46ed95359e357746307177d63d291f3e868e39da","amp;dn":"Love.Hate.S04E01.PDTV.XviD-spinzes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46ed95359e357746307177d63d291f3e868e39da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,237,149,53,158,53,119,70,48,113,119,214,61,41,31,62,134,142,57,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
