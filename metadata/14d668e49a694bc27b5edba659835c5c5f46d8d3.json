Musically, the band implements elements of traditional heavy metal bands such as Judas Priest, along with a style that is similar to early glam metal bands. The band is generally categorized as glam metal for their earlier work, although the band does not consider themselves to be so.[2][3]\n\nAlthough the band was formed by guitarist Jay Jay French in December 1972, all of their songs were written by Dee Snider from 1976 onward. Snider remarked to Johnny Carson that the proposed name for the band was &quot;This&quot; but was rejected for fear of fans saying &quot;this sucks&quot;. He describes Twisted Sister as &quot;Slade meets Sex Pistols&quot;. Twisted Sister's most well-known hits include &quot;We're Not Gonna Take It&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Rock&quot;, both popularized by regular airplay on MTV in the 1980s. Many of the band's songs explore themes of parent vs. child conflicts and criticisms of the educational system.[2]\n\nAlthough most '70s and '80s glam rock bands have gone to sell 40 to 50 million CDs and records, Twisted Sister has only sold a little over 11 million.\n\n\n\nWeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re Not Gonna Take It &amp; other Hits: \n\n\n\nTracks\n\n\nWeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re Not Gonna Take it\nI Wanna Rock\nThe Price\nLeader of the Pack\nYou CanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Stop Rock ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Roll\nStay Hungry\nBad Boys (of RockÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Roll)\nLookinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Out for #1\nOut on the Streets\nTear it Loose\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14d668e49a694bc27b5edba659835c5c5f46d8d3","amp;dn":"Twisted+Sister+-+Greatest+Hits+%5BFLAC%5D+%5Bh33t%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14d668e49a694bc27b5edba659835c5c5f46d8d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,214,104,228,154,105,75,194,123,94,219,166,89,131,92,92,95,70,216,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
