Opened in 1964, it embodies entirely new concepts of museum design. Years of planning were devoted to ensuring that the collection (the richest accumulation of Mexican artifacts in the world) would be rehoused in a building specially designed for it, and providing ample space for future acquisitions. Specialists in many fields participated: anthropologists photographed Mexican tribes; archaeologists excavated sites in order to fill gaps in the collection; craftsmen executed reconstructions of vanished civilizations. The outcome is a comprehensive and scientifically ordered panorama of the ancient cultures of Mesoamerica, from prehistory to the Spanish conquest, and their still continuing heritage","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1eb5dc2dbaa9e6db19f7858a81b6522779de6461","amp;dn":"3000+Years+of+Art+and+Life+in+Mexico+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1eb5dc2dbaa9e6db19f7858a81b6522779de6461","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,181,220,45,186,169,230,219,25,247,133,138,129,182,82,39,121,222,100,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
