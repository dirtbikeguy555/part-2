The source is the latest Milestone DVD, which has an HD master. \n\n\nI AM CUBA\nYear: 1964\nDuration: 141 Minutes\nDir.: Mikhail Kalatozov\n\n\nStarted only a week after the Cuban missile crisis and designed to be CubaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s answer to both Sergei EisensteinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s propaganda masterpiece, Potemkin and Jean-Luc GodardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s freewheeling romance, Breathless, I Am Cuba turned out to be something quite unique ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a wildly schizophrenic celebration of Communist kitsch, mixing Slavic solemnity with Latin sensuality. The plot, or rather plots, feverishly explore the seductive, decadent (and marvelously photogenic) world of BatistaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Cuba ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ deliriously juxtaposing images of rich Americans and bikini-clad beauties sipping cocktails poolside with scenes of ramshackle slums filled with hungry children and gaunt old people. Using wide-angle lenses that distort and magnify and filters that transform palm trees into giant white feathers, UrusevskyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s acrobatic camera achieves wild gravity-defying angles as it glides effortlessly through long continuous shots. But I Am Cuba is not just a catalog of bravura technique ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ it also succeeds in exploring the innermost feelings of the characters and their often desperate situations. Shown unsubtitled at the San Francisco International Film Festival, I Am Cuba received two standing ovations ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ during the screening. The first movie ever jointly presented by master filmmakers Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola, I Am Cuba is one of the great discoveries in cinema. It will change your view of cinema forever!\n\n\nSoft-subbed Spanish and Russian. Enjoy and thanks for seeding! \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37eab2aef009c5014fbd25c6c882098edd2f4cd3","amp;dn":"Soy+Cuba+%28I+Am+Cuba%29+1964+DVDRip+MKV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37eab2aef009c5014fbd25c6c882098edd2f4cd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,234,178,174,240,9,197,1,79,189,37,198,200,130,9,142,221,47,76,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
