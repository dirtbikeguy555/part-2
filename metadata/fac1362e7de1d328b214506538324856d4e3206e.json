From these works and others, he is highly regarded as a pioneer of funk and of politically conscious African-American music.[1][2] He was also a multi-instrumentalist who played the guitar, bass, piano, saxophone, and drums.\n\nSolo career\n\nIn 1970, Mayfield left The Impressions and began a solo career, founding the independent record label Curtom Records. Curtom would go on to release most of Mayfield's landmark 1970s records, as well as records by the Impressions, Leroy Hutson, The Staple Singers, Mavis Staples, and Baby Huey and the Babysitters, a group which at the time included Chaka Khan. Many of these records were also produced by Mayfield.\n\nThe commercial and critical peak of his solo career came with his music album Super Fly, the soundtrack to the blaxploitation film of the same name, and one of the most influential albums in African-American history. Unlike the soundtracks to other blaxploitation films (most notably Isaac Hayes' score for Shaft), which glorified the ghetto excesses of the characters, Mayfield's lyrics consisted of hard-hitting commentary on the state of affairs in black, urban ghettos at the time, as well as direct criticisms of several characters in the film. Bob Donat wrote in Rolling Stone Magazine in 1972 that while the film's message &quot;was diluted by schizoid cross-purposes&quot; because it &quot;glamorizes machismo-cocaine consciousness... the anti-drug message on [Mayfield's soundtrack] is far stronger and more definite than in the film.&quot; Along with Marvin Gaye's What's Going On and Stevie Wonder's Innervisions, this album ushered in a new socially conscious, funky style of popular soul music. He was dubbed 'The Gentle Genius' to reflect his outstanding and innovative musical output with the constant presence of his soft yet insistent vocals.\n\nSuper Fly brought success that resulted in Mayfield being tapped for additional soundtracks, some of which he wrote and produced while having others perform the vocals. Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips recorded Mayfield's soundtrack for Claudine in 1974, while Aretha Franklin recorded the soundtrack for Sparkle in 1976. Mayfield worked with Mavis Staples on the 1977 soundtrack for the film A Piece of the Action. He was in danger of overreaching himself being writer, producer, performer, arranger and businessman but seemed to cope and still produce a remarkable output.\n\nOne of Mayfield's most successful funk-disco meldings was the 1977 hit &quot;Do Do Wap is Strong in Here&quot; from his soundtrack to the Robert M. Young film of Miguel PiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±ero's play Short Eyes. In his 2003 biography of Curtis Mayfield, titled &quot;People Never Give Up&quot;, author Peter Burns noted that Curtis has 140 songs in the Curtom vaults. Burns indicated that the songs maybe already completed or in the stages of completion, so that they could then be released commercially. These recordings include &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, &quot;In The News&quot;, &quot;Turn up the Radio&quot;, &quot;Whats The Situation?&quot; and one recording labelled &quot;Curtis at Montreux Jazz Festival 87&quot;. Two other albums, featuring Curtis Mayfield present in the Curtom vaults and as yet unissued are, a 1982/83 live recording titled &quot;25th Silver Anniversary&quot; (which features performances by Curtis, The Impressions and Jerry Butler) and a live performance, recorded in September 1966 by The Impressions titled 'Live at the Club Chicago'.\n\nIn later years, Mayfield's music would be featured in the movies I'm Gonna Git You Sucka, Hollywood Shuffle, and Friday (though not on the soundtrack).\n[edit] Later years\n\nMayfield was active throughout the 1970s and 1980s, though he had a somewhat lower public profile. On August 13, 1990, Mayfield was paralyzed from the neck down after stage lighting equipment fell on him at an outdoor concert at Wingate Field in Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York. This tragedy set him back, but Mayfield forged ahead. He was unable to play guitar, but he wrote, sang and directed the recording of his last album, New World Order. Mayfield's vocals were painstakingly recorded, usually line-by-line while lying on his back.\n\nMayfield received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995. In February, 1998, he had to have his right leg amputated due to diabetes. Mayfield was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame on March 15, 1999. Health reasons prevented him from attending the ceremony, which included fellow inductees Paul McCartney, Billy Joel, Bruce Springsteen, Dusty Springfield, George Martin, and 1970s Curtom signee and labelmate The Staple Singers.\n\nHis last appearance on record was with the group Bran Van 3000 on the song &quot;Astounded&quot; for their album Discosis, recorded just before his death and released in 2001.\n[edit] Death\n\nCurtis Mayfield died in the early morning of December 26, 1999 at the North Fulton Regional Hospital in Roswell, Georgia, after nearly a decade of ill-health. He was survived by his wife, Altheida, 10 children, his mother, two sisters a brother, and seven grandchildren. The singer was cremated, and his ashes were given to his family.\n[edit] Legacy\n\nMayfield is remembered for his introduction of social consciousness into R&amp;B and for pioneering the funk style. Many of his recordings with the Impressions became anthems of the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, and his most famous album, Super Fly, is regarded as an all-time great that influenced many and truly invented a new style of modern black music (#69 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums). His distinctively sharp, jagged guitar riffs and rhythms strongly influenced the development of funk, while also having a major effect on the young Jimi Hendrix, who cited Mayfield as his biggest influence.[citation needed] Mayfield is also regarded as influencing other landmark albums, like Herbie Hancock's Head Hunters. One magazine notes, &quot;eulogies...have treated him...as a sort of secular saint--rather like an American Bob Marley&quot;.[citation needed] That noted, he is not as well-known as contemporaries like Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, or James Brown, perhaps because of their more consistent streams of hits or more mainstream style of music. Nevertheless, he is still highly regarded for his numerous innovations in the 1960s and 1970s and for his unique style of music, perhaps best described as &quot;black psychedelia...remarkable for the scope of its social awareness&quot;.[citation needed]\n\nAs a member of The Impressions, Mayfield was posthumously inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2003.\n\nIn 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked Mayfield #99 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time[7].","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fac1362e7de1d328b214506538324856d4e3206e","amp;dn":"Curtis+Mayfield+Complete+Solo+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fac1362e7de1d328b214506538324856d4e3206e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,193,54,46,125,225,211,40,178,20,80,101,56,50,72,86,212,227,32,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
