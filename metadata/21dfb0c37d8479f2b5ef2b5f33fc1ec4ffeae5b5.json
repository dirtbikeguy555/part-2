Starting with an empty plot of land you must construct a holding cell with basic water and electricity to house your first batch of prisoners, to buy you enough time to create a proper cell block. You'll need to hire some guards, get some showers built and unless the kitchen is up and running with chefs working away you're going to end up with a riot on your hands. From there you take your prison in which-ever direction you like. A monstrous super-max or comfortable center for rehabilitation, the choice is up to you.\n\nPrison Architect is currently in Alpha which means that the game is playable, but still in development. Not all features are implemented yet and there are many bugs that may affect gameplay. We are currently releasing monthly updated builds which include new features and bug fixes. By buying the alpha you will automatically be gifted a free copy of the full game when it's finished.\n\n\nIf you like the game, support the developers and buy it!\n\n\nSteam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/233450/\n\nDevelopers: http://www.introversion.co.uk/prisonarchitect/\n\n\n==================================================================================\n\nCHANGE LOG IN ALPHA 25\n\n==================================================================================\n\nBig changes this month! This is one of the biggest updates we've ever done. Alpha 25 was motivated by seeing prisons that just run themselves - and can even be left running overnight, without anything bad happening. This doesn't sit right with us, and running a prison shouldn't ever be something that can be done fully automatically. This month we've introduced a whole series of new systems and balance changes that bring unpredictability back to your prisoners. \n\n= Reputation \nNew prisoners sometimes have a reputation, shown when highlighting them or in their rap sheet. \nNb. Existing prisoners (in alpha 24 save games) will not have any reputation - only new arrivals \nThe reputation specifies unusual abilities or traits they may possess, which affect their behavior. \n\n- 50% of reputations are known when the prisoner arrives. The other 50% can be revealed through your informants. \n- All prisoners have a new &quot;Character&quot; tab in their rap sheet, which gives details on their reputation. \n\nSTRONG hits harder with each punch during fights \nTOUGH can withstand a lot more punishment in a fight. He can also sometimes withstand being hit by a Tazer \nVOLATILE liable to kick off without warning and for no reason \nSTOICAL will not become suppressed when locked in Solitary \nSNITCH a known informant, and as such his life may be in danger. Don't leave him alone with other prisoners for too long \nDEADLY a master in lethal combat moves, and can sometimes kill with a single hit \nEX LAW was once a Police Officer, or some other law enforcement profession. His life may be in danger \nCOP KILLER guilty of murdering a Police Officer. Your prison guards may be unable to restrain themselves when subduing him \nFEARLESS not intimidated by the sight of Armed Guards, and is less likely to surrender during a fight \nQUICK an unusually fast runner \nINSTIGATOR sows seeds of discontent in all those nearby. When he causes trouble, nearby prisoners will feel compelled to do the same\n\n- In some cases, the prisoner will have a high degree of a reputation, eg &quot;Extremely Strong&quot; or &quot;Extremely Volatile&quot;. \n\n- In a very small number of cases, you will receive a LEGENDARY PRISONER. \nThese guys have a potent mix of the above list that makes them very dangerous. \n\n= New Prisoner Categories \nTo help deal with the new troublesome prisoners, two new categories of prisoner have been created. \nPrisoners must be manually assigned to these categories. \nThese new categories have a corrisponding new Zone in the Deployment screen, and a new Regime column. \n\n- Protective Custody \nUseful for hiding your snitches, ex law enforcement etc in a safe zone where they cannot be attacked \nNb. Informants sent to protective custody lose coverage quickly (out of the loop) \nNb. During riot conditions, some of your most dangerous prisoners may attempt to attack the protective custody wing \n\n- SuperMax \nIf you simply cannot control a particular prisoner, move him to supermax. \nAllows you to segregate them away and instigate strong lockdown and security measures \n\n= Escape Tunnels Overhall \nEscape Tunnels have been rebalanced, and are now viable once again \nPrisoners in neighboring cells will team up to try to dig a combined escape tunnel. \nThey can share any tools they have during the operation \nMany weapons can now also be used as digging tools, eg Knifes, Forks etc \nGuard dogs are now more reliable at discovering tunnels, and will mark the suspected spot with a small flag. \nSearching a cell now has only a low chance to discover an escape tunnel, UNLESS the prisoner is digging it when the guard enters! \nTo discover a tunnel for certain, dismantle the toilets in the cells you suspect. \n\n= Confidential Informants (continued) \n- Any single informant now has a maximum coverage of 50% at the time he is hired \n- An informants coverage will slowly increase over time (beyond 50%), so long as his suspicion is low and he is not 'active' \n- The Informants overlay now shows the highest level of suspicion ever reached by an informant, as a black line. \n- You can now highlight and select prisoners and staff etc in the Informants window \n\n- Informants now reveal Assassination Targets - ie prisoners who will be attacked if left alone for too long \nThis is shown as a red crosshair over the prisoner. \n(Known informants / Snitches, ex law enforcement etc) \n\n= Game Balance changes \n- Prisoners responsible for a serious injury will have their category automatically increased (min-sec to medium, medium to max-sec) \n\n- Prisoners responsible for a murder will be charged and given an additional 25 year sentence, \nand will automatically reclassify as Maximum Security (if they weren't already) \n\n- The 'temperature' of your prison must now be at least 33% before a riot can start \n\n- 10 Prisoners must be rioting before a prison-wide RIOT status can occur. \nTo stop the riot, you must reduce the number of rioting prisoners to 3 or less. \n\n- Tazer Training Program \nAll regular guards must now pass the Tazer Certification Program before they are permitted to use a tazer. \nThis takes place in the classroom and is led by the Chief. \nThe staff window now shows which guards have body armor and tazers. \nNb. When loading an alpha 24 save, all Tazers owned by regular Guards and Dog Handlers will be confiscated, and a refund given. \nNb. Dog Handlers can no longer carry Tazers. \n\n- Prisoners can now pick up weapons from their current room during fights, escapes, riots etc. (Based on what is available as contraband) \n- The Morgue is now a source of Knifes and Scissors \n- Prisoners can now improvise a Shank in the Workshop \n- Prisoners can now improvise a Baton in the Cleaning Cupboard (by snapping mops) \n- Prisoners can now improvise a wooden pickaxe in the Workshop (for digging tunnels) \n\n= Mod System Continued \n- Now supports multiple active mods at once, even if those mods all add their own new graphics \n- New property to set material auto-consumed on job \n- Can now auto-order raw materials \n\n- NEW SCRIPT COMMANDS: \nGetNearbyObjects - Get a list of all nearby objects of a certain type \nNavigateTo - Instruct an entity to go somewhere \nClearRouting - Clear an entity's destination \n\n- Panic Button mod \nA new 'official' test mod that adds a Panic Button to the game, using the new script commands. \nInjured staff members will run to it and press it, and guards will be summoned to the area. \n\n- Fixed : You can no longer place Foundations that you cannot afford \n\n- 'Unlimited Funds' option in 'New Prison' screen. \nSpend as much money as you like while building your prison - a more pure sandbox mode. \n\n- Prisoners will now be assigned to Rehab programs more reliably, when addicted/alcoholic/withdrawn\n\n\n\n\n\n================================================================================\nSe Habla EspaÃƒÂ±ol - Venezolana 100% - :3\n================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21dfb0c37d8479f2b5ef2b5f33fc1ec4ffeae5b5","amp;dn":"Prison+Architect+-+Alpha+25b","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21dfb0c37d8479f2b5ef2b5f33fc1ec4ffeae5b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,223,176,195,125,132,121,242,181,239,43,95,51,252,30,196,255,234,229,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
