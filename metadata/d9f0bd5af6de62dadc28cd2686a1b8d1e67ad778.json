Spybot Portable Edition ( http://portableapps.com/apps/security/spybot_portable )\n\nI make some minor patch to update module, now you can update your software.\nBtw, Antivirus &amp; Antispyware Last Updated at 23-Aug-2014\n\nAll credit to my big bro zerodayz &amp; jibbajabbax :-)\n\nInstallation:\n1. Extract RAR from &quot;Your Apps Here&quot; folder to any folder you want.\n2. If you want to put that folder in &quot;Program Files&quot;, you should extract &quot;SpybotPortable.exe.Mine [This Loader Will Running in Program Files]&quot;\n3. RAR files in &quot;AppSpybot&quot; folder is for backup, you can delete it if u want. But i suggest you to keep it since one day your update might broke this working version because update might rewrite patched exe and dll. If this happen, you can restore &quot;patched exe &amp; dll&quot; from this rar.\n\n\nThats all, if you like this torrent, and you think this torrent download speed is suck, please help us seed.\nIf it already fast, you better help to seed other good torrent out there.\n\nLet me know if you have problem with this torrent ;-)\n\nEnjoy and sorry for my bad English...
