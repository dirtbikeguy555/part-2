Now, in The Upside of Irrationality, he exposes the surprising negative and positive effects irrationality can have on our lives. Focusing on our behaviors at work and in relationships, he offers new insights and eye-opening truths about what really motivates us on the job, how one unwise action can become a long-term habit, how we learn to love the ones we're with, and more.\n \n \nDrawing on the same experimental methods that made Predictably Irrational one of the most talked-about bestsellers of the past few years, Ariely uses data from his own original and entertaining experiments to draw arresting conclusions about howÃ¢â‚¬â€and whyÃ¢â‚¬â€we behave the way we do. From our office attitudes, to our romantic relationships, to our search for purpose in life, Ariely explains how to break through our negative patterns of thought and behavior to make better decisions. The Upside of Irrationality will change the way we see ourselves at work and at homeÃ¢â‚¬â€and cast our irrational behaviors in a more nuanced light.\n  \n  \n   \n \n   ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dff73fc407cdac240099d0e7e81e65179ca5779","amp;dn":"The+Upside+of+Irrationality+By+Dan+Ariely+%28epub%29+%5BQwerty80%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dff73fc407cdac240099d0e7e81e65179ca5779","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,255,115,252,64,124,218,194,64,9,157,14,126,129,230,81,121,202,87,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
