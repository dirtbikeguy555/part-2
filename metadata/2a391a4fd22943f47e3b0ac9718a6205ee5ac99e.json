The band was chosen out of 700 artists by Ben Folds and Keith Lockhart. Also in October of that year, the band showcased at CMJ's Music Marathon at which they gained recognition by SPIN.com as one of their 25 Must-Hear Artists from the 2009 CMJ Festival.\n\nIn November 2009, the band released their first full-length album titled Songbook, written, primarily, by Joseph Keefe and Vanessa Jeanne Long. The band toured with Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros in support of their debut.\n\nFamily of the Year has been recognized for independent fundraising. Donation-based sales for the band's first EP Where's the Sun helped fund the recording of their debut LP Songbook. To fund the bands touring, Family of the Year made $5 tour postcards available on the band's website. The band refers to their postcards as &quot;the old-fashioned twitter&quot;.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_the_Year&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_the_Year&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n- 2009 - Family of the Year - Where's the Sun EP\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
