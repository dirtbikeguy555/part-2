In the past, Frisbee and JP were sent to prison for fixing races for the mafia and are doing so again so they can keep racing. While recuperating in the hospital and reminiscing over his loss, JP finds out that he was selected for the &quot;Redline,&quot; despite not qualifying in the last race, due to popular demand and because two racers withdrew.\nThe Redline race takes place on Roboworld, a militarized planet ruled by cyborgs. The Roboworld government is violently opposed to the race being held on their planet as they have several ongoing projects that they wish to be kept top-secret. JP and the other racers are transported to a backwater moon near Roboworld to prepare. There he meets Sonoshee the winner of the Yellowline.\nGuerilla forces on Roboworld as well as the Bounty Hunter team, sabotage a number of Roboworld's planetary defenses. JP, Sonoshee, and the other racers speed across the planet under heavy attack from the Roboworld military, which have targeted each of the racers with intent to kill. During the race the guerillas unleash a powerful bioweapon named Funky Boy. Funky Boy goes on a rampage, destroying many of the Roboworld units and much of the landscape around them. One of the Roboworld high ranking generals decides to merge with another Bioweapon to fight against Funky Boy while the race continues on.\nIn Funky Boy's rampage, Sonoshee's car is destroyed, knocking her out in the process. JP however finds her alive and allows her to join him in continuing the race together. Frisbee who was forced to make another deal with the Mafia is almost killed when he refuses to sabotage JP's car again, but is saved by the 4 armed scrounger, who shoots down the mafia and after sits down to watch the rest of the race with Frisbee. The final sprint to the finish shows Machinehead with JP/Sonoshee both fighting for victory. In his haste, Machinehead uses the steamlight; a form of energy that can release an unimaginable amount of power, to give him the edge over the race. Sonoshee quickly reciprocates with her own piece of steamlight, given to her by her father on her seventh birthday. Both racers blaze towards the finishing line with their cars tearing away due to the super-sonic speed.\nJP and Sonoshee are neck to neck with Machinehead but unable to get past him. The explosive placed in JP's car by Frisbee earlier on, is activated, the resulting explosion to give what's left of JP's car a boost of speed to pass Machinehead. JP and Sonoshee touch the finishing line less than a fraction of a second before Machinehead and are declared the victors. Audiences throughout the galaxy celebrate JP's amazing victory. The other racers, exhausted and in awe remark about the incredible feat performed by JP. While suspended in weightless motion, JP pulls Senoshee close and kisses her and the two victors confess their love for each other.\n\nEnjoy !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a4b5dea57d1a267f24d053dc113b2812cb8c31b","amp;dn":"Redline+2009.1080p.BluRay.x264+.+NVEE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a4b5dea57d1a267f24d053dc113b2812cb8c31b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,75,93,234,87,209,162,103,242,77,5,61,193,19,178,129,44,184,195,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
