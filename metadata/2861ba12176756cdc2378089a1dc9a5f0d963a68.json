The first time they realized that the group's vocalists, Ranking Roger and Dave Wakelin, had gone off to form a group without them was when their accountant phoned to finalize the divorce. While the defectors had formed General Public, Cox and Steele set about creating something new of their own. Apart from not wanting to repeat the mistakes the Beat made, and a vague notion of adding both jazz and soul to the Beat's ska roots (they also decided to feature a strong vocalist), there was no real master plan.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\t\t\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel:\t\t\tI.R.S./MCA\n\n\nOne of the most exciting albums released during a decade of artifice and extravagance, in a mere ten songs and 35 minutes the Fine Young Cannibals created a masterpiece. Admittedly the trio had some help -- backing singers, guest musicians (including former Squeeze pianoman Jools Holland and Talking Head's Jerry Harrison) -- but that doesn't take away the band's own accomplishment. Remaining true to the FYC's vision of tying past and present musical styles together into artful new pop packages, The Raw &amp; the Cooked features a shopping list of genres. Mod, funk, Motown, British beat, R&amp;B, punk, rock, and even disco are embedded within the songs, while the rhythms, many synthetically created, are equally diverse. In less delicate hands this would be nothing more than an everything including the kitchen sink motley mess, but FYC manage this mix with subtly and elan. Two-thirds of the record were released as U.K. singles, all were hits, and each one proudly boasted a distinctly different blend of styles. &quot;Good Thing,&quot; for example, was the trio's tribute to the legendary all-night Northern soul parties of the '60s, but is much more than a mere meld of mod and Motown. It's actually built round a slinky R&amp;B riff, fueled by a boogie-woogie piano, and slammed home with a cracking beat. &quot;I'm Not the Man I Used to Be&quot; is a torrid torch song, but fired by a futuristic jungle beat and an almost housey production. Then, of course, there's &quot;She Drives Me Crazy,&quot; which features the most unique, and instantly identifiable, beat/riff combination of the decade. Even the four tracks that didn't make the singles cut could have, if MCA had the audacity to keep releasing them. &quot;Tell Me What&quot; perfectly re-creates the Tamla sound, with only the synth giving it a modern touch, but on the rest FYC delve deeper into funk, disco, soul, and lovingly coax them into the modern era. Every one of Raw's tracks simmers with creativity, as the hooks, sharp melodies, and irrepressible beats are caressed by nuanced arrangements and sparkling production. Never has music's past, present, and future been more exceptionally combined.\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.She Drives Me Crazy\n02.Good Thing\n03.I'm Not The Man I Used To Be\n04.I'm Not Satisfied\n05.Tell Me What\n06.Don't Look Back\n07.It's Ok (It's Alright)\n08.Don't Let It Get You Down\n09.As Hard As It Is\n10.Ever Fallen In Love?\n\n\n\nThanks to &quot;only1joe&quot; for the previous upload!\n\n\nSupport the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.
