Do I really need to buy fertilizer? What on earth is that creature crawling on the tomatoes? My crops took off and the zucchini are in the sidewalk who has time to harvest this all?! FOOD GROWN RIGHT, IN YOUR BACKYARD is a primer for these questions and more.\n\n In response to the rising interest in homegrown foods, the Seattle Urban Farm Co. builds vegetable gardens for everyone from busy families to restaurants. Along the way, Colin and Brad teach beginner growers from all walks of life the techniques of organic food production. In this full color, beautifully photographed guide, they prove that anyone can develop a green thumb, as they show readers how to build a garden from the ground up, explain general garden basics, discuss the best types of crops to try, and much more.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CIkpZ3nLL.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CIkpZ3nLL.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nHome Staging: Home Soft Decoration  \n\nPublisher: LST Publishing House\nBingxu Du\n2012\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 7538174893\nISBN-13: 978-7538174892\nPDF \n256 pages \n13.5 MB\n\nThe book presents diverse home decoration styles (American, European &amp; Chinese) with stunning pictures.
