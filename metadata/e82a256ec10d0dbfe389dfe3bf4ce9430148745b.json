She reveals which cheap, everyday foods can give us all the benefits of so-called superfoods at a fraction of the price and why frying can be the healthiest way to cook. Fiona becomes a human guinea pig to test some of the top-selling health drinks and supplements. She investigates whether antioxidant smoothies really give us the healthy boost we think and discovers why multivitamin pills might do us more harm than good. In a unique experiment with scientists from Aston and Liverpool John Moores universities, she sets out to find the healthiest breakfast, and discovers why we'd be better off with bacon and eggs rather than cereal and fruit. To find out whether we can really detoxify our bodies, she puts some popular detox foods and drinks to the test and reveals why we're better off with fresh foods and the odd glass of wine.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/98/The-Truth-About-Healthy-Eating-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9d/The-Truth-About-Healthy-Eating-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fc/The-Truth-About-Healthy-Eating-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d3/The-Truth-About-Healthy-Eating-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/18/The-Truth-About-Healthy-Eating-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2c/The-Truth-About-Healthy-Eating-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f2/The-Truth-About-Healthy-Eating-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/af/The-Truth-About-Healthy-Eating-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b5/The-Truth-About-Healthy-Eating-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ec/The-Truth-About-Healthy-Eating-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/83/The-Truth-About-Healthy-Eating-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/62/The-Truth-About-Healthy-Eating-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF-21 (~2509 Kbps)\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 58mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.07 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07dxmyk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e82a256ec10d0dbfe389dfe3bf4ce9430148745b","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Truth+About+Healthy+Eating+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.or","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e82a256ec10d0dbfe389dfe3bf4ce9430148745b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,42,37,110,193,13,13,191,227,137,223,227,191,76,233,67,1,72,116,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
