THE PACIFIC tracks the intertwined real-life journeys of three U.S. Marines across the vast canvas of the Pacific Theater during World War II. The miniseries follows these men and their fellow Marines from their first battle with the Japanese on Guadalcanal, through the rain forests of Cape Gloucester and the strongholds of Peleliu, across the bloody sands of Iwo Jima and through the horror of Okinawa, and finally to their triumphant but uneasy return home after V-J Day.\n\nFormat : MPEG-4 / AVC\nFile size: 475 MiB avg per episode\nDuration : 56mn avg per episode\nOverall bit rate : 1 223 Kbps\nBit rate : 1 100 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 400 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate\nmode : Constant\nFrame rate : 29.970 fps\nAudio: AAC, 2 channel, 160 kbps, 48kHz.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a756a4cad3de47a361bbccceaf43d1dfb04a6b1","amp;dn":"The+Pacific+Complete+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a756a4cad3de47a361bbccceaf43d1dfb04a6b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,117,106,76,173,61,228,122,54,27,188,204,234,244,61,29,251,4,166,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
