Escher \n1998 | Taschen | ISBN: 3822878790 | PDF | 17 pages | 3.6 Mb\n\nThis book helps you finalize physically, how the drawings, theory and constructions of MC Escher can come alive. As I have loved his works through my life, I didn't have the mathematical orientation to bring to life the constructions brought to you in these printed pages. The book supplies the precut printed iterations of the artist and illustrates how they can be assembled into beautiful little &quot;works of art&quot;. They demonstrate not any particular items Escher constructed, but how his art can seamlessly cover a isometric object. I believe anyone curious about how his surface plane coverings work will enjoy this book.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28aaefa394c9434434753bf7930759afea78ec4a","amp;dn":"M.+C.+Escher+Book+of+Boxes+-+100+Years+1898-1998+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28aaefa394c9434434753bf7930759afea78ec4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,170,239,163,148,201,67,68,52,117,59,247,147,7,89,175,234,120,236,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
