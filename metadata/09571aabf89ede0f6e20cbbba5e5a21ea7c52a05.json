(AASECT, the American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors &amp; Therapists)\r\n\r\n For Secrets of the Sex Masters, master journalist Carl Frankel interviewed nineteen of the world's best sex teachers and, in partnership with them, turned the interviews into chapters that will guide readers to having the best sex of their lives.\r\n\r\n Chapters cover what you might expect (oral sex, anal sex) as well as topics that are essential to having great sex but aren't covered in most books on the subject C how to manage shame when it arises in the bedroom, for instance. The book is divided into three sections. The first section provides essential information with chapters on the dance of anatomy and energy, oral sex, anal sex (as noted above), power exchange (also known as kink or BDSM), and touch. The second section addresses issues relating to mind, heart and spirit, with chapters on finding the lover within, keeping the flame alive, sex and shame, sex as improv and creative play, eroticizing safer sex, and fantasy, role play and communication. The third and final section takes up advanced skills and 'special treats,' with chapters on extended female orgasm, non-ejaculatory male orgasm, female ejaculation, 'Bondassage' (a gently kinky form of massage), Tantra and energy sex.\r\n\r\n All in all, a mix of need-to-know information and Jedi-like capabilities that anyone can learn.\r\n\r\n Contributors include the legendary porn actress Nina Hartley and her husband, the master dominant Ernest Greene; Joseph Kramer, the creator of Sexological Bodywork; Sheri Winston; the award-winning sex educator and medical professional; Charles Muir, who is widely credited with bringing Tantra to the West; and fourteen other masterful 'sexperts.'\r\n\r\n Secrets of the Sex Masters isn't only a book about how to have amazing sex. It's about how to have an amazing life. At the end of the day, if you want to be a wonderful lover, you need to love wonderfully. Secrets of the Sex Masters provides all the technical information you need to be very skilled in bed. It also goes deeper than that and provides invaluable guidance on how to love wonderfully.
