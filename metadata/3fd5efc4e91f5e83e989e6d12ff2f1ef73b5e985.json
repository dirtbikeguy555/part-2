Fans who recall the extremely popular LEGO Space theme from the 80Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s are in for an updated treat that nearly defies definition. Yet for any LEGO space or sci-fi fan, this book delivers more than 200 pages of building instructions and interstellar eye candy that make this book a must buy.\n\nThis book is receiving five stars not just because of the overall content quality, but because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s like four books in one:\n\n1. Classic LEGO space fans will thoroughly enjoy seeing modern evolutions of their favorite theme, complete with the Ã¢â‚¬Å“LLÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ starship designation from the past. Never before have gray, blue and yellow LEGO bricks looked so cool. And as for fans of classic space sub themes like Ice Planet, Blacktron, Space Police and others, fret not. Reid and Goddard have tactfully included these themes, too, veiled in such a manner as to not infringe upon LEGO trademarks.\n\n2. Builders of all skill levels and ages will love the well-rendered, step-by-step instructions of around a dozen space creations ranging from the soviet era Sputnik to a creepy space worm. The cool factor here is that the creations evolve from a sort of Ã¢â‚¬Å“you view it, you do it,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ motif. You actually feel like you can relive portions of the booksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ loose storylineÃ¢â‚¬â€which is described next-- by pausing to build a drop ship, robotic turtle or survey robot.\n\n3. Sci-fi fans and builders alike will enjoy the fact that this book includes a lot of narrative. Every creation has a story to go with it that far exceeds the insights provided by any previous LEGO book. The book begins with an accurate depiction of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s space program, then promptly moves into science fiction territory by telling bite-sized chunks of the history of Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Federation,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ throughout. And as you might expect, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The FederationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ deals with enemies, innovation, infiltration and imperialistic concerns that spawn spectacular LEGO creations to suit.\n\n4. This book is flat-out inspiring and fun. You can open this book to any page and just enjoy the storyline, the photography or both. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re guaranteed to get lost in the imaginary world and find yourself inspired to go build something fun, even if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s as small as the six piece, robotic Ã¢â‚¬Å“BlipÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ featured on page 92.\n\nWhile this book is spectacular in itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own right, it is remarkable for another reason as well. Co-author Peter ReidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Exo-Suit creation featured on page 24 will become an official LEGO set sometime in 2014 (as part of the LEGO CUUSOO program).\n\nThis hardbound book sets a new standard for future authors wishing to focus on a specific LEGO theme. Reid and Goddard have accurately captured the beauty, appeal and potential of the original LEGO Space theme and allow you to literally play along. But their greatest achievement is the mark of a truly outstanding book. They open the mind of the reader to a boundless world of imagination.\n2 of 2 people found the following review helpful\n5.0 out of 5 stars Space, the new frontier. Nov. 21 2013\nBy LEGO man - Published on\nFormat:Hardcover\nLEGO Space is an awesome book that toys with my imagination. The author makes me want too start to build space themed builds. The sign that this is a good book is that it captivates so much it makes me, the reader want to start to build space which I don't. I love the pictures, the story and the instructions. I can't wait to see what else they do.\n1 of 1 people found the following review helpful\n5.0 out of 5 stars I think that is why I enjoyed this book so much Dec 12 2013\nBy S. Sterling - Published on\nFormat:Hardcover\nAs any LEGO builder can attest, there is always more to building than just stacking the bricks together; I think that is why I enjoyed this book so much. The authors combined the story of the Federation and their explorations and adventures in space, great building instructions, and pages of inspiration for builders into one comprehensive piece. Flipping through the pages I really liked how they had feature areas that provided background information on various space craft and robots seen in the book. There is no shortage of amazing images for inspiration!\n\n\nimage\nScientia est potentia\n\nRequest textbooks here:","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fd5efc4e91f5e83e989e6d12ff2f1ef73b5e985","amp;dn":"LEGO+Space-+Building+the+Future+%5BPDF%5D%7EStormRG%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fd5efc4e91f5e83e989e6d12ff2f1ef73b5e985","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,213,239,196,233,31,94,131,233,137,230,209,47,242,241,239,115,181,233,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
