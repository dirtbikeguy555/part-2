It is free however they charge $30 to mail you the newest version. This program is about a month old and is regularly updated from the website. www.camcommerce.com\n\nThis pos has many great things that the expensive pos like quickbooks have and also some they normaly don&amp;#039;t include. It does have a built in accounting software although I am not sure if you can export sales information.\n\nIt uses open sql server to and u can look information up via odbc however you can&amp;#039;t write to the database\n\nThe only downside of this program ~ for me at least!  They provide no way to upload a text file or .cvs of your inventory unless you get this $200 program from them called Import Star.  If anybody happens to get it or figures out a way to import files a different way. Please let me know\n\nI got frustrated looking for quickbooks pos 6 and they version 4 wasn&amp;#039;t vista compatible so I am using this instead.\n\nextract the folder with izarc\n\ninstall and reboot\n\ndefault username and password is system\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8398833b4b8070a648d61719ab7ac6050d2be8d3","amp;dn":"Free+Point+of+Sale%21+Retail+Ice+Pos+version+7.5.122","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8398833b4b8070a648d61719ab7ac6050d2be8d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,152,131,59,75,128,112,166,72,214,23,25,171,122,198,5,13,43,232,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
