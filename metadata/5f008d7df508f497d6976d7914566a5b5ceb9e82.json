Quality may not be the best 'cause it was created from epub version of this awesome 7th edition,I really like it guys, everything I wanted to have in Warhammer 40000 is in this rulebook, for example magic phase was upgraded a lot. \nYou can finally summon Daemons in battle! Even the almighty ones such as Great Unclean One or even entire squad of Bloodletters of Khorne! I would like to spoiler more but it would spil your fun on discovering what's new =)\n\nIf you like it and have cash remember to buy original version of rulebook to support Games Workshop.\n\nPS: I will upload epub version soon, need to check it first.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f008d7df508f497d6976d7914566a5b5ceb9e82","amp;dn":"Warhammer+40k+7th+edition+rulebook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f008d7df508f497d6976d7914566a5b5ceb9e82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,0,141,125,245,8,244,151,214,151,109,121,20,86,106,91,92,235,158,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
