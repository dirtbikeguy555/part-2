Mysterious deaths and surreal disturbances grow more and more frequent, all with one thing in common: spirals. Whether it is a spring, the spiral of a snail shell or a spiral staircase, the pattern recurs in all the strange events. Shuichi's father seems to be specially in tune with the Spiral, and Kirie does her best to keep Shuichi sane as he becomes more and more able to sense doom approaching.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67e68c4ca29798b00c92520ada115a13e63a12a0","amp;dn":"Uzumaki-Spiral-HD-DVDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67e68c4ca29798b00c92520ada115a13e63a12a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,230,140,76,162,151,152,176,12,146,82,10,218,17,90,19,230,58,18,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
