Each chapter provides conceptual diagrams to facilitate comprehension of difficult concepts, and presents both normal and abnormal clinical conditions to illustrate how physiology serves as an important basis for diagnosis and treatment. Hallmark pedagogical features emphasize problem-solving skills and promote review and retention: Clinical Focus and From Bench to Bedside boxes, a comprehensive glossary, and online USMLE-style review questions with answers and explanations. Companion web site offers additional resources for students (question bank, animations, searchable text) and faculty (image and test banks, PowerPoint slides for use in class).\n\nBRIEF CONTENTS\nPreface v\nContributors viii\nAcknowledgments ix\nPART I Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ CELLULAR PHYSIOLOGY 1\nPART II Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ NEUROMUSCULAR PHYSIOLOGY 42\nPART III Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ BLOOD AND IMMUNOLOGY 166\nPART IV Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ CARDIOVASCULAR PHYSIOLOGY 212\nPART V Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ RESPIRATORY PHYSIOLOGY 326\nPART VI Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ RENAL PHYSIOLOGY AND BODY FLUIDS 399\nPART VII Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ GASTROINTESTINAL PHYSIOLOGY 471\nPART VIII Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ TEMPERATURE REGULATION AND EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY 550\nPART IX Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ ENDOCRINE PHYSIOLOGY 589\nPART X Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ REPRODUCTIVE PHYSIOLOGY 676\nAppendix: Common\nGlossary 735\nIndex 795","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fcab4cbf2c85b6a90522c6209209f3627a1eaea","amp;dn":"Medical+Physiology+-+Principles+for+Clinical+Medicine+%284th+Ed%2C+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fcab4cbf2c85b6a90522c6209209f3627a1eaea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,202,180,203,242,200,91,106,144,82,44,98,9,32,159,54,39,161,234,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
