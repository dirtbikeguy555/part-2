This version follows both the efforts of Fletcher Christian to get his men beyond the reach of British retribution, and the epic voyage of Lieutenant Bligh to get his loyalists safely to East Timor in a tiny lifeboat.\n\n\n\nCONTAINER....................: MP4\nFORMAT.......................: X264\nGENRE........................: Drama\nFILE SIZE....................: 1.06 GB\nRESOLUTION...................: 1280x544\nVIDEO BITRATE................: 1000kbps\nAUDIO FORMAT/BITRATE.........: AAC/160kbps\nFRAME RATE...................: 23.976 fps\nLANGUAGE.....................: English\nSUBTITLES....................: English\nRUNTIME......................: 2:11:03\n\n\nNotes:\n\nThis is the 1984 version with Anthony Hopkins and Mel Gibson.\n\nPlease note that my bitrates and file sizes are optimized for those who store and watch movies on their computers. The bitrates are high enough to look perfect on &quot;normal&quot; sized monitors and low enough to keep download times short and the file size small enough for those who have limited hard drive space to work with. If you plan on watching something on a large HD screen, you're going to need one of the larger file size, higher bitrate torrents. The larger the screen you'll be watching on, the higher the bitrate has to be to maintain picture quality. If you have a large screen, you'll need to experiment too see what bitrate it takes to maintain a quality picture for your particular size screen.\n\nPlease seed for as long as possible, preferably until reaching a share ratio of at least 3:1.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:260b279e55630a7b91efb7051e4080fd115557f1","amp;dn":"The+Bounty+%281984%29+%5B720p%5D+x264+-+Jalucian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"260b279e55630a7b91efb7051e4080fd115557f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,11,39,158,85,99,10,123,145,239,183,5,30,64,128,253,17,85,87,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
