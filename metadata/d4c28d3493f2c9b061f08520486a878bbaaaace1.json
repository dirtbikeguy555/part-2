More than anything, leaving terra firma required all of our amassed knowledge, talent, and imagination. Such is the case with BLIND GUARDIAN, a band from Krefeld, Germany that refuses to be bound to the genre of music that spawned them and whose accumulated knowledge, talent, and imagination have created portals into senses beyond the five we experience in common, ordinary life.\nGreatly inspired by life experience, world myths, legends, and their own fervent creativity, metalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most epic storytellers BLIND GUARDIAN continually aspire to define themselves on a whole new level. With their highly-anticipated, orchestral tenth studio album Ã¢â‚¬Å“Beyond The Red MirrorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, they have successfully captured the scope of their essence with unprecedented accuracy.\nThis is not a typical soundtrack or musical or rock opera. It is, simply, typical BLIND GUARDIAN. Set for release in early 2015, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Beyond The Red MirrorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has raised the bar on the gold standard trajectory the band had set themselves on when they first formed. This strategy has been followed to the letter and there will be nothing comparable to this anywhere in the panorama of music until BLIND GUARDIAN decides to record again.\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been over four-and-a-half years since the release of 2010Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s world-renowned Ã¢â‚¬Å“At The Edge Of TimeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ album (which debuted at #1 on the American Billboard Heatseekers chart). In October of 2012, the band settled into Twilight Hall Studios in Grefrath, Germany with producer Charlie Bauerfeind (SAXON, HAMMERFALL, HELLOWEEN) to begin recording Ã¢â‚¬Å“Beyond The Red MirrorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. For the next two years, the band worked relentlessly at infusing their inimitable, emotion-rich music with classical orchestrations within and throughout.\nThese ten new tracks will transport the listeners - via a mysteriously powerful red mirror - into an otherworldly dimension that includes tyrants, gods, and the Holy Grail!\n\nTrack list\nTrack listing:\n\nCD1\n01.
