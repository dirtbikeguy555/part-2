Initially, the pair enjoy the good life in Italy, often to the anger and dismay of Philippe's much put-upon fiancee Marge (Marie Laforet). However, as Tom's funds begin to run dry, it becomes more and more apparent that Philippe has no intentions of returning to the U.S., forcing Tom to consider more nefarious means of maintaining his extravagant lifestyle. Purple Noon is adapted from Patricia Highsmith's novel The Talented Mr. Ripley, and like Alfred Hitchcock's classic Strangers on a Train, also based on Highsmith's work, the theme of identity transference is dominant. The subject even extends to the homoerotic undercurrents which simmer below the surface of Tom and Philippe's relationship, setting into motion a love/hate tension which explodes during a high seas journey.\n\nDuration : 1h 52mn\nOverall bit rate : 1 801 Kbps\nCodec: XVID\nWidth : 672 pixels\nHeight : 400 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 1.680\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\n\nAudio: AC-3\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n\nLanguage: French (original)\nSubtitles (*.srt): English, German, Portuguese","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfa308e23eca3f17919bda7a320834163d85d4e7","amp;dn":"Plein+Soleil+%28Purple+Noon%29+1960+Alain+Delon%2C+French+%2B+Softsubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfa308e23eca3f17919bda7a320834163d85d4e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,163,8,226,62,202,63,23,145,155,218,122,50,8,52,22,61,133,212,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
