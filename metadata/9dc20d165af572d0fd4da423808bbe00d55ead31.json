Opening with the epic &quot;Like a Rolling Stone,&quot; Highway 61 Revisited careens through nine songs that range from reflective folk-rock (&quot;Desolation Row&quot;) and blues (&quot;It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry&quot;) to flat-out garage rock (&quot;Tombstone Blues,&quot; &quot;From a Buick 6,&quot; &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;). Dylan had not only changed his sound, but his persona, trading the folk troubadour for a streetwise, cynical hipster. Throughout the album, he embraces druggy, surreal imagery, which can either have a sense of menace or beauty, and the music reflects that, jumping between soothing melodies to hard, bluesy rock. And that is the most revolutionary thing about Highway 61 Revisited -- it proved that rock &amp; roll needn't be collegiate and tame in order to be literate, poetic, and complex. \n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img515.imageshack.us/img515/8075/61revisitedfrontbh4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img515.imageshack.us/img515/8075/61revisitedfrontbh4.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Tracklist :.\n\n1.
