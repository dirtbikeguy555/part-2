You will help Taylor make life or death decisions, and face the consequences together.\n\nAcclaimed writer Dave Justus (Fables: The Wolf Among Us) weaves a gripping interactive story through the aftermath of a crash landing on an alien moon. Taylor is stranded, the rest of the crew are dead or missing, and TaylorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s communicator can only reach you.\n\nA totally unique experience enabled by modern devices, this story plays out in real time. As Taylor works to stay alive, notifications deliver new messages throughout your day. Keep up as they come in, or catch up later when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re free.\n\nOr, dive in and jump back to earlier points in the story, and see what happens when you make a different choice. Simple actions can have a profound effect. Complete any single path to restart the story and unlock this mode.\n\nLifeline is a deep, immersive story of survival and perseverance, with many possible outcomes. Taylor is relying on YOU.\n\n\nInternet connection not required. No in-app purchases and no ads.\n\n\nPraise for Lifeline:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve played many games that I find engrossing, but Lifeline may be one of the first that changed the way I thought about my daily routine, which leapt off the screen and became a part of my lived experience.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ - Eli Cymet, Gamezebo\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I cared Ã¢â‚¬â€œ really cared Ã¢â‚¬â€œ about the fate of a completely fictional character. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think any other game IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve played has made me feel that way before.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ - Matt Thrower, PocketGamer\n\nWhat's New:\n\nSquashed some bugs, and fixed up the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s permissions so it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ask for everything under the sun. Or Tau Ceti, as the case may be. TaylorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fate is still in your hands!\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.threeminutegames.lifeline.google&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.threeminutegames.lifeline.google&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cadeefcccfb5d866d5000a12cd4e1234e046e7a","amp;dn":"Lifeline+v1.3.4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cadeefcccfb5d866d5000a12cd4e1234e046e7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,173,238,252,204,251,93,134,109,80,0,161,44,212,225,35,78,4,110,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
