Above all, he delves into the idea of &quot;freedom over choice&quot;, which states that humans have complete and total responsibility over their actions. While taking care to address, build on, and refute the works of Descartes, Husserl, Hegel, and other earlier philosophers, Sartre covers &quot;Being-for-itself&quot;, &quot;Being-for-others&quot;, and ethics, arguing that the body and the mind are capable of sharing a true single consciousness.\n\nAs one of the seminal works of existentialist theory, and thus a pinnacle of 20th-century philosophy, Being and Nothingness is a fundamental text for anyone interested in the field.\n\nAbout the author: Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-1980) was a significant voice in the creation of existential thought. His explorations of the ways human existence is unique among all life-forms in its capacity to choose continue to influence fields such as Marxist philosophy, sociology, and literary studies. He was awarded the 1964 Nobel Prize in Literature, but refused the honor.\n\nAudible Audio Edition\nListening Length: 39 hours and 18 minutes\nProgram Type: Audiobook\nVersion: Unabridged\nPublisher: Audible Studios\nAudible.com Release Date: March 23, 2013\nLanguage: English\nASIN: B00C023BLQ\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
