They are generally told as something of a parable to the modern conditions of rotating character. The stories are usually narrated by either Belinda or Sela. The two control two books of fairy tales and they are generally used to either help or hinder those listening to them. Over the course of the series the fairy tales get used in different ways, for instance the two narrators can control the characters in magical worlds, modern characters outside of the fairy tales become fairy tale characters, or the two narrators live through the fairy tales themselves to examine their actions. The series is also notable for its generally misleading covers, as they often contain revealing pictures of the female characters, the characters in the stories themselves are generally portrayed in a more respectable manner. The series is also noted for some of its variant covers which are not fairy tales representations, but mythical or legendary ones such as Cleopatra or Rosie the Riveter.\n\nTrade Paperback Collections\n\nGrimm Fairy Tales Volume 1 (#1-6)\nGrimm Fairy Tales Volume 2 (#7-12)\nGrimm Fairy Tales Volume 3 (#13-18)\nGrimm Fairy Tales Volume 4 (#19-24)\nGrimm Fairy Tales Volume 5 (#25-30)\nGrimm Fairy Tales Volume 6 (#31-36)\nGrimm Fairy Tales Volume 7 (#37-42)\nGrimm Fairy Tales Volume 8 (#43-50)\nGrimm Fairy Tales Volume 9 (#51-?)\nGrimm Fairy Tales Volume 10 (#?-64)\nGrimm Fairy Tales Volume 11 (#65-70)\nGrimm Fairy Tales Volume 12 (#71-76)\nGrimm Fairy Tales Volume 13 (#77-?)\nGrimm Fairy Tales Volume 14 (#82-84 &amp; 86-87)\nGrimm Fairy Tales Volume 15 (#89-94)\nGrimm Fairy Tales presents Age of Darkness vol. 1 (#94-98)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aad38bde54aba9d22c2b4090040813ff838ef431","amp;dn":"Grimm+Fairy+Tales+%28001+-+100+%2B+All+Mini-Series+%26amp%3B+Extras%29+%2820","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aad38bde54aba9d22c2b4090040813ff838ef431","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,211,139,222,84,171,169,210,44,43,64,144,4,8,19,255,131,142,244,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
