Science and Technology of Organic Farming is a concise, readily applicable resource for understanding the scientific basis for organic farming and the technology required to achieve adequate yields through plant nutrition and protection. It provides the tools necessary to dispel hampering myths about organic farming so farmers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ regardless of their experience Ã¢â‚¬â€œ can strengthen their own growing practices.\n\nEmphasizes Foundations of Organic Farming Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Composting, Cover Crops, &amp; Farm Manures\nAddressing relevant issues and concepts along with practical applications, chapters cover soil fertility and plant nutrition; individual plant requirements; liming; farm manures, green manures, and composts; mulching and tillage; and weed, insect, and disease control, as well as companion planting and storage. The text also includes more than 50 illustrations and a glossary with common technical and scientific terms used in conventional and organic agriculture. This valuable reference is ideal for farmers, agricultural advisers, and soil and plant scientists Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in both academia and industry.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17bdb72d145a20f8c6046093dea027a4df690a0a","amp;dn":"Science+and+Technology+of+Organic+Farming+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17bdb72d145a20f8c6046093dea027a4df690a0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,189,183,45,20,90,32,248,198,4,96,147,222,160,39,164,223,105,10,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
