Also integral to the Georgia bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound were the bluesy, soul-inflected vocals and organ playing of Gregg Allman, on whose shoulders much of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s future would rest after the tragic death of his brother Duane in a motorcycle accident in October 1971, a mere four days after At Fillmore East was certified gold.\nHowever, despite the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s undeniably innovative mix of rock, country, blues, and jazz, it was producer Tom Dowd who helped craft the live sessions into a remarkably kinetic and timely album. Dowd, who had previously helmed the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second album, 1970's Idlewild South, skillfully edited the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s various performances together, maximizing the best bits and, as in the case of Ã¢â‚¬Å“You DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Love Me,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ combined the first section with the last section to form a concise, masterful take. The 2014 six-disc box set The 1971 Fillmore East Recordings brings together all of the unedited recordings the Allman Brothers made during their two-night, four-show stand at the Fillmore East. That means longtime fans get four versions of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s set opener, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Statesboro Blues,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ as well as other cuts the group repeated each set. Thankfully, the Allman Brothers rarely played a song the same way twice, and every track here holds something surprising and unexpected to discover. Also included is the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s June 1971 show closing out the Fillmore East for owner Bill Graham, who had decided to shut the venue down. Combine all of the music here, much previously unreleased, with John LynskeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s heartfelt and informative liner notes detailing all of the concert drama, both on stage and off, and The 1971 Fillmore East Recordings ends up working as both a completist anthology and a joyful rock tribute.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b70d61ec2e0532cdfdd482dfed01100435d14b44","amp;dn":"Allman+Brothers+Band+-+The+1971+Fillmore+East+Recordings+6CD+BOX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b70d61ec2e0532cdfdd482dfed01100435d14b44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,13,97,236,46,5,50,205,253,212,130,223,237,1,16,4,53,209,75,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
