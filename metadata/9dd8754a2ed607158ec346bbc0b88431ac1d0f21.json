One of the only books available today that uses the increasingly popular and cost-effective Atmel AVR embedded controller as the platform and application for learning, Embedded C Programming and the Atmel AVR, 2E is the perfect choice for novices. Featuring a host of fully-functional example applications, this highly innovative book enables users to adopt a &quot;learn by doing&quot; approach as they develop the knowledge and skills needed to achieve proficiency. Following an introduction to Atmel AVR RISC processors, readers are launched immediately into an embedded C language tutorial. Here, they'll experiment with variables and constants, operators and expressions, control statements, pointers and arrays, memory types, preprocessor directives, real-time methods, and more! In addition to a comprehensive library functions reference, an entire chapter on the CodeVision AVR C Compiler provides clear, step-by-step instruction in IDE installation and operation, mixing Assembler with C, and using the Code Wizard Code Generator. Use of peripherals - such as keypads, LCD displays, and other common embedded microcontroller-related devices - is also explored fully in this all-inclusive, state-of-the-art programmer's how-to and reference manual.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dd8754a2ed607158ec346bbc0b88431ac1d0f21","amp;dn":"Embedded+C+Programming+and+the+Atmel+AVR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dd8754a2ed607158ec346bbc0b88431ac1d0f21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,216,117,74,46,214,7,21,142,195,70,187,192,184,132,49,172,29,15,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
