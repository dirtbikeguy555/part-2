Incorporating the latest advances in brain scanning and neuroscience, Dutton demonstrates that the brilliant neurosurgeon who lacks empathy has more in common with a Ted Bundy who kills for pleasure than we may wish to admit, and that a mugger in a dimly lit parking lot may well, in fact, have the same nerveless poise as a titan of industry.\n \nDutton argues that there are indeed Ã¢â‚¬Å“functional psychopathsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ among usÃ¢â‚¬â€different from their murderous counterpartsÃ¢â‚¬â€who use their detached, unflinching, and charismatic personalities to succeed in mainstream society, and that shockingly, in some fields, the more Ã¢â‚¬Å“psychopathicÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ people are, the more likely they are to succeed. Dutton deconstructs this often misunderstood diagnosis through bold on-the-ground reporting and original scientific research as he mingles with the criminally insane in a high-security ward, shares a drink with one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most successful con artists, and undergoes transcranial magnetic stimulation to discover firsthand exactly how it feels to see through the eyes of a psychopath.\n \nAs Dutton develops his theory that we all possess psychopathic tendencies, he puts forward the argument that society as a whole is more psychopathic than ever: after all, psychopaths tend to be fearless, confident, charming, ruthless, and focusedÃ¢â‚¬â€qualities that are tailor-made for success in the twenty-first century. Provocative at every turn, The Wisdom of Psychopaths is a riveting adventure that reveals that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s our much-maligned dark side that often conceals the trump cards of success. \n\n2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d5b5a0c3ec864d0bbdcf7dcd152a4a1e7bb9770","amp;dn":"The+Wisdom+of+Psychopaths+%282012%29+-epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d5b5a0c3ec864d0bbdcf7dcd152a4a1e7bb9770","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,91,90,12,62,200,100,208,187,220,247,220,209,82,164,161,231,187,151,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
