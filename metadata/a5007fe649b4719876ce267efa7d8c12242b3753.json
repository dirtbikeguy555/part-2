In 2003 an amateur accountant from Tennessee named Chris Moneymaker shocked the world by winning $2.5 million in the World Series of Poker Main Event. MoneymakerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unlikely victory coincided perfectly with the launch of the World Poker Tour, a televised series of international poker tournaments that quickly became the highest rated show in the history of the Travel Channel. Suddenly poker was everywhere and online poker exploded into a multi-billion dollar industry. Millions of hopefuls around the country logged on and tried to become the next poker superstar. Out of this boom, a brand-new profession emerged: the online poker professional.  \n\nFor millions of young people, online poker became more than a game Ã¢â‚¬â€ it was a lifestyle. It was an opportunity to live completely outside the system, to discover your true identity, and to get rich doing something you truly love. All the elements that made poker such an integral part of American culture throughout history were found in online poker, and these 21st century poker mavericks helped launch the game into an exciting new era. But everything changed on April 15th, 2011 (known as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Black Friday&quot;), when the US Department of Justice unsealed indictments against the major US-facing online poker sites and shut down online poker in America. Suddenly, these online poker professionals werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mavericks. They were outlaws.   \n\nBET RAISE FOLD is a coming-of-age story for an entire generation of young poker professionals. We follow Danielle, a young mother from rural Minnesota who used online poker to support her family; Tony, a Las Vegas tournament pro who co-hosts the World Poker Tour on television; and Martin, a world-traveler from Australia obsessed with understanding the intricacies of the game. These characters used online poker to build a life, only to have it all stripped away in one fell swoop by forces beyond their control.\n\nBET RAISE FOLD: The Story of Online Poker celebrates the roller coaster ride that was the online poker boom, the evolution of poker as a game, and the enduring spirit of the poker maverick.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5007fe649b4719876ce267efa7d8c12242b3753","amp;dn":"BET+RAISE+FOLD+Movie+1080p.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5007fe649b4719876ce267efa7d8c12242b3753","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,0,127,230,73,180,113,152,118,206,38,126,250,125,140,18,36,43,55,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
