The first book is technically MISTBORN: THE FINAL EMPIRE, though people just tend to call it MISTBORN or MISTBORN 1. The entire series consists of THE FINAL EMPIRE (2006), THE WELL OF ASCENSION (2007), and THE HERO OF AGES (2008). It's a hybrid epic fantasy heist story with a focus on political intrigue and powerful action scenes. If you want a more standard review, scroll down to the news media ones. If you want to launch into the chapters, here's a link. Read directly below for a more casual explanation in Brandon's own words.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28d3295ca8138871b13e81e1629d1fa867cb8f39","amp;dn":"Brandon+Sanderson+-+MistBorn+1+-+3+++Elantris+1+-+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28d3295ca8138871b13e81e1629d1fa867cb8f39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,211,41,92,168,19,136,113,177,62,129,225,98,157,31,168,103,203,143,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
