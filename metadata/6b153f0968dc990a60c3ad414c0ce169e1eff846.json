The album was heralded as a return to form for Clapton, who had struggled with alcohol addiction in the mid-1980s and had recently found sobriety. Much of it has an electronic sound, mostly influenced by the 1980s rock scene, but it also includes blues songs like &quot;Before You Accuse Me,&quot; &quot;Running on Faith,&quot; and &quot;Hard Times.&quot;\n\nThe strongest single commercially from this album was &quot;Bad Love,&quot; which earned him the 1990 Best Male Rock Vocal Performance Grammy Awards, and reached the No. 1 position on the Album Rock Chart. &quot;Pretending&quot; had also reached the No. 1 position on the Album Rock Chart the previous year, remaining at the top for five weeks (&quot;Bad Love&quot; had only stayed for three weeks).\n\nWhile the album was only a moderate commercial success at the time, reaching number 16 on the Billboard 200 chart, it went on to become his first solo studio album to go double platinum. This is one of Eric Clapton's favourite albums.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b153f0968dc990a60c3ad414c0ce169e1eff846","amp;dn":"Eric+Clapton+-+Journeyman+%282014%29+Audio+Fidelity+SACD+FLAC+Beolab","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b153f0968dc990a60c3ad414c0ce169e1eff846","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,21,63,9,104,220,153,10,96,195,173,65,76,12,225,105,225,239,248,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
