Dave is misogynistic, racist, brutally violent, egotistical and a womanizer, although he defends himself against many of these accusations as he says that his hate is equal opportunity. However unlawful, he uses intimidation and brutal force to defend his ideals. The most notorious of his actions is purportedly murdering a suspected serial date rapist, which is why he has been given the nickname &quot;Date Rape Dave&quot;. He lives with two of his ex-wives - sisters Barbara and Catherine - in an effort to keep family together, namely his two daughters, Helen and Margaret, who each have a different sister as their mother. Dave still maintains a sexual relationship with both sisters - whenever the mood suits any of them - while he openly has other sexual relationships. His life is put under a microscope after he is caught on video brutally beating a person with who he got into an automobile crash... \n\n\nScreenshots:\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.minus.com/iQgdUIdjRqeKw.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.minus.com/iQgdUIdjRqeKw.png&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.minus.com/i4i7jtB32VYoH.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.minus.com/i4i7jtB32VYoH.png&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.minus.com/ibtaiyba6k22MP.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.minus.com/ibtaiyba6k22MP.png&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0864c534ee19c913390a2e10af18fb697d7f8832","amp;dn":"Rampart+%282011%29+720p+BrRip+x264+-+700MB+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0864c534ee19c913390a2e10af18fb697d7f8832","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,100,197,52,238,25,201,19,57,10,46,16,175,24,251,105,125,127,136,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
