A divorced father, he has custody of his 23-year-old slacker son Ben, who dreams of wealth and freedom but is too lazy to find a real job. Dr. Katz's receptionist is the acerbic Laura. He spends his free time in the bar &quot;Jacky's 33&quot; with his friends Stan and Julie, the bartender. Most of Dr. Katz's patients are voiced by members of the stand-up comic fraternity. This gives them a chance to perform their routines in cartoon form.&quot;\n\nThis torrent includes the six full seasons of the hilarious &quot;Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist&quot; created by Jonathan Katz and Tom Snyder. Together with voice-actor H. Jon Benjamin (Bob's Burgers, Archer, Home Movies, Family Guy, The Venture Bros etc.), Laura Silverman (Half Baked, The Sarah Silverman Program, Bob's Burgers etc.) and lots of other appearances.\n\n\nFormat: AVI / MPG\n\n\nSeason One:\n\n01 - Pot-Bellied Pigs\n02 - Pretzelkins\n03 - Bully\n04 - Cholesterol\n05 - Everybody's Got a Tushy\n06 - Family Car\n\n\nSeason Two:\n\n01 - Bystander Ben\n02 - Real Estate\n03 - Glasses\n04 - Office Management\n05 - Bees and SIDS\n06 - Drinky the Drunk Guy\n07 - Sticky Notes\n08 - It Takes Some Getting Used To\n09 - The Particle Board\n10 - A Journey for the Betterment of People\n11 - Theory of Intelligence\n12 - Henna\n13 - ESP\n\n\nSeason Three:\n\n01 - Monte Carlo\n02 - Blind Date\n03 - Fructose\n04 - Earring\n05 - Koppleman and Katz\n06 - Guess Who\n07 - Day Planner\n08 - Mourning Person\n09 - Studio Guy\n10 - Lil' Helper\n11 - Big Fat Slug\n12 - New Phone System\n13 - Reunion\n\n\nSeason Four:\n\n01 - Ben Treats\n02 - Memoirs\n03 - Electric Bike\n04 - Broadcaster Ben\n05 - Trash Day\n06 - Sharon Meyers\n07 - Mask\n08 - Closets\n09 - Wild Weekend\n10 - Chopper\n11 - Alibi\n12 - Ben-Centennial\n13 - Undercover\n\n\nSeason Five:\n\n01 - Old Man\n02 - Fanny Pack\n03 - Metaphors\n04 - Movies\n05 - Ticket\n06 - Phone Luv\n07 - Chain Letter\n08 - Babysitting Ben\n09 - Miles Away\n10 - London Broil\n11 - Feng Shui\n12 - Alderman\n13 - Paranoia\n14 - Waltz\n15 - Anniversary\n16 - Community Theater\n17 - Ping-Pong\n18 - Thanksgiving\n\n\nSeason Six:\n\n01 - Sissy Boy\n02 - Pullman Square\n03 - Wisdom Teeth\n04 - Past Lives\n05 - Ben's Partay\n06 - Walk for Hunger\n07 - Used Car\n08 - Ball and Chain\n09 - Snow Day\n10 - Garden\n11 - Big TV\n12 - Vow of Silence\n13 - You're Belinda\n14 - Radio Katz\n15 - Expert Witness\n16 - Bakery Ben\n17 - Uncle Nothing\n18 - Lerapy\n\n\nDon't expect the quality in this upload to be too brilliant.
