An army of deadly monsters. An epic battle for the future of peculiardom.\r\n\r\nThe adventure that began with Miss Peregrineâ€™s Home for Peculiar Children and continued in Hollow City comes to a thrilling conclusion with Library of Souls. As the story opens, sixteen-year-old Jacob discovers a powerful new ability, and soon heâ€™s diving through history to rescue his peculiar companions from a heavily guarded fortress. Accompanying Jacob on his journey are Emma Bloom, a girl with fire at her fingertips, and Addison MacHenry, a dog with a nose for sniffing out lost children.\r\n\r\nTheyâ€™ll travel from modern-day London to the labyrinthine alleys of Devilâ€™s Acre, the most wretched slum in all of Victorian England. Itâ€™s a place where the fate of peculiar children everywhere will be decided once and for all. Like its predecessors, Library of Souls blends thrilling fantasy with never-before-published vintage photography to create a one-of-a-kind reading experience","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:819798eb5f9f29517e57f0f5545deea85b7c176c","amp;dn":"Library+of+Souls","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"819798eb5f9f29517e57f0f5545deea85b7c176c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,151,152,235,95,159,41,81,126,87,240,245,84,93,238,168,91,124,23,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
