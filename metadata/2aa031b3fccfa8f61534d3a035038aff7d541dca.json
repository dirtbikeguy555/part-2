Korn began their existence as the Bakersfield, CA-based metal band LAPD, which included guitarists James &quot;Munky&quot; Shaffer and Brian &quot;Head&quot; Welch, bassist Reginald &quot;Fieldy Snuts&quot; Arvizu, and drummer David Silveria. After issuing an LP, the members of LAPD in 1993 crossed paths with Jonathan Davis, a mortuary science student moonlighting as the lead vocalist for the local group Sexart. They soon asked Davis to join the band, and upon his arrival the quintet rechristened itself Korn.[\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Twisted Transistor\n02.Politics\n03.Hypocrites\n04.Souvenir\n05.10 Or A 2-Way\n06.Throw Me Away\n07.Love Song\n08.Open Up\n09.Coming Undone\n10.Getting Off\n11.Liar\n12.For No One\n13.Seen It All\n14.Tearjerker\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                  ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2aa031b3fccfa8f61534d3a035038aff7d541dca","amp;dn":"Korn+-+See+You+On+The+Other+Side+%282005%29+mp3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2aa031b3fccfa8f61534d3a035038aff7d541dca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,160,49,179,252,207,168,246,21,52,211,160,53,3,138,255,125,84,29,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
