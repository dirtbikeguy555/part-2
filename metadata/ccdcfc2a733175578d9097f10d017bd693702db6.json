She seems to have fulfilled every immigrant's dream: Ivy League education; success as a writer of a wildly popular political blog; money for the things she needs. But what came before is more like a nightmare: wrenching departure from family; humiliating jobs under a false name. She feels for the first time the weight of something she didn't think about back home: race.\n\nObinze--handsome and kind-hearted--was Ifemelu's teenage love; he'd hoped to join her in America, but post 9/11 America wouldn't let him in. Obinze's journey leads him to back alleys of illegal employment in London; to a fake marriage for the sake of a work card, and finally, to a set of handcuffs as he is exposed and deported. \n\nYears later, when they reunite in Nigeria, neither is the same person who left home. Obinze is the kind of successful &quot;Big Man&quot; he'd scorned in his youth, and Ifemelu has become an &quot;Americanah&quot;--a different version of her former self, one with a new accent and attitude. As they revisit their shared passion--for their homeland and for each other--they must face the largest challenges of their lives. \n\nSpanning three continents, entering the lives of a richly drawn cast of characters across numerous divides, Americanah is a riveting story of love and expectation set in today's globalized world.\n\n                                 Purple Hibiscus\n\nFifteen-year-old Kambili and her older brother Jaja lead a privileged life in Enugu, Nigeria. They live in a beautiful house, with a caring family, and attend an exclusive missionary school. They're completely shielded from the troubles of the world. Yet, as Kambili reveals in her tender-voiced account, things are less perfect than they appear. Although her Papa is generous and well respected, he is fanatically religious and tyrannical at homee&quot;a home that is silent and suffocating.\n\nAs the country begins to fall apart under a military coup, Kambili and Jaja are sent to their aunt, a university professor outside the city, where they discover a life beyond the confines of their fathere(tm)s authority. Books cram the shelves, curry and nutmeg permeate the air, and their cousinse(tm) laughter rings throughout the house. When they return home, tensions within the family escalate, and Kambili must find the strength to keep her loved ones together.\n\nPurple Hibiscus is an exquisite novel about the emotional turmoil of adolescence, the powerful bonds of family, and the bright promise of freedom.\n\n\n                                  Half of a Yellow Sun\n\nWith her award-winning debut novel, Purple Hibiscus, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie was heralded by the Washington Post Book World as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“21st century daughterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of Chinua Achebe. Now, in her masterly, haunting new novel, she recreates a seminal moment in modern African history: BiafraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impassioned struggle to establish an independent republic in Nigeria during the 1960s. \n\nWith the effortless grace of a natural storyteller, Adichie weaves together the lives of five characters caught up in the extraordinary tumult of the decade. Fifteen-year-old Ugwu is houseboy to Odenigbo, a university professor who sends him to school, and in whose living room Ugwu hears voices full of revolutionary zeal. OdenigboÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beautiful mistress, Olanna, a sociology teacher, is running away from her parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ world of wealth and excess; Kainene, her urbane twin, is taking over their fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s business; and KaineneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s English lover, Richard, forms a bridge between their two worlds. As we follow these intertwined lives through a military coup, the Biafran secession and the subsequent war, Adichie brilliantly evokes the promise, and intimately, the devastating disappointments that marked this time and place.\nEpic, ambitious and triumphantly realized, Half of a Yellow Sun is a more powerful, dramatic and intensely emotional picture of modern Africa than any we have had before.\n\n                                   The Thing Around Your Neck\n\nThese twelve dazzling stories from Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie Ã¢â‚¬â€ the Orange Broadband PrizeÃ¢â‚¬â€œwinning author of Half of a Yellow Sun Ã¢â‚¬â€ are her most intimate works to date.\n\nIn these stories Adichie turns her penetrating eye to the ties that bind men and women, parents and children, Nigeria and the United States. In Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Private Experience,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a medical student hides from a violent riot with a poor Muslim woman, and the young mother at the centre of Ã¢â‚¬Å“ImitationÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ finds her comfortable life in Philadelphia threatened when she learns that her husband has moved his mistress into their Lagos home. \n\nSearing and profound, suffused with beauty, sorrow and longing, this collection is a resounding confirmation of AdichieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s prodigious literary powers.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccdcfc2a733175578d9097f10d017bd693702db6","amp;dn":"Chimamanda+Ngozi+Adichie+%284+Fictions%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccdcfc2a733175578d9097f10d017bd693702db6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,220,252,42,115,49,117,87,141,144,151,241,13,1,123,214,147,112,45,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
