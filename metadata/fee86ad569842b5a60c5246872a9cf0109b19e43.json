In contrast, his 1974 album That Nigger's Crazy featured the comedy style which made him famous\r\nfocusing on racial issues with plenty of swearing. That album was a breakthrough for Pryor, going platinum, and winning a Grammy in the Grammy Awards of 1975 for\r\nBest Comedy Performance.\r\n\r\nIs it Something I Said was another success critically, topping the Billboard black charts, going platinum and winning another Grammy for Best Comedy performance.\r\nBicentennial Nigger won him his third Grammy award in three years and went top 5 in the black charts. Pryor won a fourth Grammy for Live On The Sunset Strip in\r\n1982.\r\n\r\nPryor's career suffered a major setback in 1980 when he was badly burnt while freebasing cocaine, which he acknowledged in his &quot;Live on Sunset Boulevard&quot;\r\nperformance. During this, he waved a lit match around, and stated, &quot;This is Richard Pryor, Running down the street!&quot; In 1986, Pryor announced that he had multiple\r\nsclerosis and this eventually led to his retirement as a standup comedian in 1992. This album features some material from his 1992 concerts.\r\n\r\nIn 1998, Richard Pryor won the first Mark Twain Prize for American Humor from the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\r\nThis album contains all of the material that earned him that award","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fee86ad569842b5a60c5246872a9cf0109b19e43","amp;dn":"Richard+Pryor+-+The+Complete+Warner+Bros+Recordings+%281968-1992%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fee86ad569842b5a60c5246872a9cf0109b19e43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,232,106,213,105,132,43,90,96,197,36,104,114,169,207,1,9,177,158,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
