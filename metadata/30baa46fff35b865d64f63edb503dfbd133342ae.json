When you master one exercise, you move on to the next, and so on. Because the later exercises build on the earlier ones, they are sometimes called the &quot;ten steps&quot;. When you reach the tenth exercise, you will be just about as strong as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s possible for a human being to be in that movement. For this reason, the tenth exercise in any chain is called the &quot;Master Step&quot;. How this all works will be crystal clear if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve picked up a copy of the Convict Conditioning bodyweight book.\nWhy it should be downright illegalÃ¢â‚¬â€and a punishable offenseÃ¢â‚¬â€not to practice pullups with furious intensity,for as long as you live...\nIf you go into a gym these days, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see guys and girls doing lots of different back movements. Bent-over rows, cable rows, pulldowns, one-arm rows, as well as working on any number of flashy new back training machines available. But the most productive and useful upper back exercise in the world is usually the one most trainees avoid. That exercise is the pullup. You could write a book on why the pullup is so effective. We donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have time for that, but right now we are going to give you four damn good reasons why the pullup should be an absolutely mandatory part of your training:\nNumber one:  Pullups are the number-one upper back builder. This is hard to dispute. As well as working virtually all the upper back muscles, pullups really effectively target the latissimus dorsi, the &quot;lats&quot;, the biggest muscles of the upper back. Our distant ancestors evolved pulling their own weight up through the trees, and that anatomical heritage is still there, lying dormant in all our bodies. Pullups harness this genetic advantage in the quickest possible way. Some guys get big lats almost overnight from this exercise!\nNumber two:  Pullups are functional. This is an important part of prison training. It teaches you to move. Pullups are a training in self-movement. A fat, out-of-shape bodybuilder might be able to deadlift five-hundred pounds, but can he get up and over a high wall? A strong, agile pullup-trained athlete can do this in half a second.\nNumber three: Pullups are the best biceps builder in the world. Look at the guns on a gymnast if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe me. Curls only work the biceps through one joint, the elbow joint, and this limits their power. Pullups work the biceps through both joints, the shoulder and the elbow. This makes them the most effective technique possible.\nNumber four: Pullups are very safe. Most acute injuries in the gym occur to the spine and particularly the lower back area. A lot of these come from back training, and bending over while holding weightsÃ¢â‚¬â€deadlifts, rows and cleans can cause a lot of injuries this way. But because your feet are off the ground during harder pullups, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s minimal force going through your spine. Your chances of a lower back injury during pullups are virtually zilch.\nIf you want more information on pullup theory and anatomy, refer to the Convict Conditioning book, chapter seven. What every athlete needs to know about how to get really strong with pull-ups...\nSo if the pullup is so great, why is it that so many trainees are skipping this movement in their routine? Well, there are two reasons. First, a lot of guysÃ¢â‚¬â€either heavy people or beginnersÃ¢â‚¬â€look at classic pullups and think theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re just too tough. These people may not yet be able to pull their own bodyweight. So they get intimidated by this exercise. Coming from the opposite angle, many advanced athletes see the pullup as too easy; they might be able to easily pull their weight with two hands, and turn to barbell exercises to provide more weight.\nBoth these attitudes show a lack of understanding of progressive calisthenics.
