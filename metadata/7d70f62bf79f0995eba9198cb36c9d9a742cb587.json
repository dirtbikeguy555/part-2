The text offers streamlined information that reinforces a connection of key concepts to experimentation. Though the use paired art, and new science illustrations, readers benefit from a visual representation of experimental connections. Animations and video clips are tied to key illustrations with practice questions to provide a variety of ways to experience a key concept. This new edition offers an appropriate balance of concepts and experimentation. Experimental detail is offered when it helps to reinforce the concept being explained.\n\nAbout the Author\nGerald C. Karp received a bachelorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s degree from UCLA and a Ph.D. from the University of Washington. He conducted postdoctoral research at the University of Colorado Medical Center before joining the faculty at the University of Florida. Gerry is the author of numerous research articles on the cell and molecular biology of early development. His interests have included the synthesis of RNA in early embryos,the movement of mesenchyme cells during gastrulation, and cell determination in slime molds. For 13 years, he taught courses in molecular, cellular, and developmental biology at the University of Florida. During this period, Gerry coauthored a text in developmental biology with N. John Berrill and authored a text in cell and molecular biology. Finding it impossible to carry on life as both full-time professor and author, Gerry gave up his faculty position to concentrate\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface\nAcknowledgments\nChapter 1: Introduction to the Study of Cell and Molecular Biology\nChapter 2: The Chemical Basis of Life\nChapterS: Bioenergetics, Enzymes, and Metabolism\nChapter 4: The Structure and Function of the Plasma Membrane\nChapter 5: Aerobic Respiration and the Mitochondrion\nChapter 6: Photosynthesis and the Chloroplast\nChapter 7: Interactions Between Cells and Their Environment\nChapterS: Cytoplasmic Membrane Systems: Structure, Function, and Membrane Trafficking\nChapter 9: The Cytoskeleton and Cell Motility\nChapter 10: The Nature of the Gene and the Genome\nChapter 11: Gene Expression: From Transcription to Translation\nChapter 12: Control of Gene Expression\nChapter 13: DNA Replication and Repair\nChapter 14: Cellular Reproduction\nChapter 15: Cell Signaling and Signal Transduction: Communication Between Cells\nChapter 16: Cancer\nChapter 17: The Immune Response\nChapter 18: Techniques in Cell and Molecular Biology\nGlossary\nAdditional Readings\nIndex","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d70f62bf79f0995eba9198cb36c9d9a742cb587","amp;dn":"Cell+and+Molecular+Biology+-+Concepts+and+Experiments+%287th+Ed%29%28g","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d70f62bf79f0995eba9198cb36c9d9a742cb587","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,112,246,43,247,159,9,149,235,169,25,140,179,108,157,154,116,44,181,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
