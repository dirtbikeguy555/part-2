It's beautiful imagery from Sven Nykvist's magnificent cinematography, its high level of pretension and its inability to be comprehensible have given it a unique place in cinema history. &quot;Persona&quot; can causes a myriad of personal reactions. Perhaps its greatest triumph is forcing the viewer to allow &quot;it&quot; to penetrate... to open yourself to its deeply felt expressions and perhaps have it touch upon your own. &quot;Persona&quot; is rife with universal emotions; pain, love, desire, regret, longing. This is a film that can be viewed multiple times garnering more from each visit ... or less, depending on how you allow it to brush your subconscious... that part of you filled with emotions which you rarely, if ever, openly discuss.\n\nFile Name .........................................: Persona (Ingmar Bergman, 1966).avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,223,827,714 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:19:08\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD 1.1.2 Final\nFrame Size ......................................: 640x480 (AR: 1.333)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1535 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.200 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [], [N-VOP], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 256 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 2\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060827/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060827/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: Swedish (film), English (commentariy, 2nd track)\nSubtitles: English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese\n\nPosted originally at KG by odietamo, whom we thank\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b7ddfa8776fabfe701ca51361d7874cd9b7c900","amp;dn":"Persona+%28Ingmar+Bergman%2C+1966%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b7ddfa8776fabfe701ca51361d7874cd9b7c900","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,125,223,168,119,111,171,254,112,28,165,19,97,215,135,76,217,183,201,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
