So it is clear that any one-disc attempt at wrapping up the highlights is bound to work more like a sampler than a true best-of. And though this release is given the &quot;Vol. 1&quot; tag, it remained without a sequel as late as 2005, when Reprise reissued it without altering the contents. Yet another frustration is that previously unreleased songs take the place of missing classics like &quot;Sweet Thing,&quot; &quot;Clouds,&quot; &quot;Fate,&quot; &quot;Close the Door,&quot; and &quot;Stay.&quot; (That's just for starters.) Nonetheless, the disc does contain Khan's most popular work, from ballads like &quot;Through the Fire&quot; to anthems like &quot;I'm Every Woman&quot; and &quot;Ain't Nobody,&quot; along with other radio staples, such as &quot;I Feel for You&quot; and &quot;Tell Me Something Good.&quot; At the absolute least, Khan deserves a solo-only best-of, as well as a disc that sticks strictly to her work with Rufus. (The Very Best of Rufus Featuring Chaka Khan, the only anthology dedicated to Rufus, has its own set of issues.) .&quot;\n\nChaka's World bio on shelved album: &quot;Dare You To Love Me&quot;:\n\n&quot;...there are quite a few who aren't aware of Chaka's 'Lost Album' from 1995. The 17 track 'Dare You To Love Me' is Chaka's unreleased album and follow up to the Grammy Award winning 'The Woman I Am' (1992). Recording sessions for the 'Dare You....' project took place during 1993-1995, and the CD was originally scheduled to be released in '95. 'Dare You To Love Me' featured production by David Gamson, Andre Betts, Keith Crouch, and Arif Mardin. The project also included contributions by Prince, Me'shell Ndegeocello and Rosie Gaines among other musicians. Chaka Khan was very confident following the completion of 'Dare You To Love Me', but its release was postponed and ultimately cancelled. Warner Brothers was in the midst of a serious corporate shake up, and certain artists were relegated to subsidiary record labels owned by WEA. Chaka was sent to Reprise Records and WEA decided to simply disregard all of the hard work that Chaka (and others!!) put into 'Dare You To Love Me', while opting to release 'Epiphany: The Best Of Chaka Khan, Vol.1' in 1996. This CD features 11 of Chaka's classic songs and 7 tracks recorded for the aborted 'Dare You...' CD. All of this (including a lack of promotion for her previous 3 CDs) would lead up to Chaka leaving Warner Brothers. Knowing that this would fulfill her contract with WEA, Chaka promoted 'Epiphany' and went along with the program before her exit. Many songs from the 'Dare You..' sessions were in limbo, while Warners released several of the tracks on various soundtracks and various WEA endorsed compilations.&quot;\n\nAmazon.com reviews of &quot;The Platinum Collection&quot;:\n\n#1: &quot;'Chaka Khan - The Platinum Collection' ? Wow, just what serious 'Chakaholics' need...another collection of songs we've owned for years, and it's amazing that Rhino/Warner Brothers refuses open the vaults and release the music fans are interested in buying (the rare 'Chaka Khan' CD for example!). 'Chaka Khan' (1982) is one of Chaka's critically acclaimed (and Grammy Award Winning!) CDs, but Rhino insists on rehashing hits in a variety of packages, like this Platinum Collection for example. Shoot, Rhino / Warner Brothers is so screwed up that they even used a 25 year old picture of Chaka for the cover art, and you have to really wonder what they're smoking at the Warner Brothers Headquarters! No wonder Chaka ran away from this fu**** up company in the first place! Sorry, but this so-called 'Platinum Collection' is a waste of retail space, and I can't rate it higher than 1 star. Fans have made better compilations at home! /SD (fr.'Chaka's World') P.S. The Remixes included on this CD are THE SAME crappy versions on the 'Remix Project' CD from the mid 80's, so don't even hope for something special on this 'Platinum Collection', which SHOULD be called a Piece Of Sh**!!&quot;\n \n#2: Disservice for Chakafiles...Or Chakaholics as some call them. Warner Bros. have done the same disservice to Chaka's music that has been done to Motown artists and the Isley Brothers; reissue their music in endless compilation packages that completely gloss over their career and make them seem more popular than they were. And 'The Platinum Collection' does the same to Chaka - her best compilation is Epiphany: The Best of Chaka Khan, Vol. 1 which she hand picked the tracks for herself. Otherwise if you seriously love listening to Chaka Khan (as I do) stick with the original albums. AND GET THAT 1982 SELF TITLED ALBUM BACK OUT!!! It won a friggin' GRAMMY; put it out on a 20'th Century Masters with another bonus disk, just like Diana (Deluxe Edition) and Bad Girls received! And what bothers me more is that I see that only her first two solo albums, plus I Feel for You' and The Woman I Am are still in print domestically in the US - that leaves an enormous chunk of her recorded output either as pricey import CD's and OOP nuggets. The same fate has met Rufus with classics like Street Player, Masterjam plus their 1973 debut in OOP land. Now that Motown is rectifying their policies along with the Isleys to focus on full length album reissues as opposed to compilations I think Chaka's people should get on the ball as well; she really deserves better than this.&quot; \n\n#3: &quot;Any true fans of Chaka Khan will avoid this silly rehashing of all the material she has done since 1978! This doesn't even belong in her section at all! We all love the music believe me, but Warners and Rhino wanna be cheap. Generic. COST EFFECTIVE.....Even at the cost of one of the most legendary female vocalists of our time! Frankly, I'll say what a lot of us think: why keep wasting money on these rehashes when you could make money on a nice 4-6 disc boxset with all of her rarities and maybe a nice DVD with some videos and deleted ones? At least release Dare You To Love Me and Chaka Khan (1982)! Chaka Khan doesn't deserve this neglect!&quot;\n\nPersonal note from uploader: Nuff said eh? I'll just let the music speak for itself - and that it does beautifully. Enjoy and share! :-) \n\nTRACK LIST\n\nEpiphany - The Best Of Chaka Khan - Vol. 1 / I'm Every Woman - The Best Of \n==========================================================================\n01.
