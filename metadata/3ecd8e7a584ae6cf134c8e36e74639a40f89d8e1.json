The kernel handles all interactions between the CPU and the external world, and determines which programs will share processor time, in what order. It manages limited memory so well that hundreds of processes can share the system efficiently, and expertly organizes data transfers so that the CPU isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t kept waiting any longer than necessary for the relatively slow disks.\n\nThe third edition of Understanding the Linux Kernel takes you on a guided tour of the most significant data structures, algorithms, and programming tricks used in the kernel. Probing beyond superficial features, the authors offer valuable insights to people who want to know how things really work inside their machine. Important Intel-specific features are discussed. Relevant segments of code are dissected line by line. But the book covers more than just the functioning of the code; it explains the theoretical underpinnings of why Linux does things the way it does.\n\nThis edition of the book covers Version 2.6, which has seen significant changes to nearly every kernel subsystem, particularly in the areas of memory management and block devices. The book focuses on the following topics:\n\n- Memory management, including file buffering, process swapping, and Direct memory Access (DMA)\n- The Virtual Filesystem layer and the Second and Third Extended Filesystems\n- Process creation and scheduling\n- Signals, interrupts, and the essential interfaces to device drivers\n- Timing\n- Synchronization within the kernel\n- Interprocess Communication (IPC)\n- Program execution\n\nUnderstanding the Linux Kernel will acquaint you with all the inner workings of Linux, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more than just an academic exercise. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn what conditions bring out LinuxÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best performance, and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see how it meets the challenge of providing good system response during process scheduling, file access, and memory management in a wide variety of environments. This book will help you make the most of your Linux system.\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1. Introduction\nChapter 2. Memory Addressing\nChapter 3. Processes\nChapter 4.
