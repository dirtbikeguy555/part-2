Packed with fruit and vegetables, a smoothie can increase energy, add fibre to your diet and provide valuable antioxidants. In Green Kitchen Smoothies, bestselling authors David and Luise share their favourite smoothie recipes, as well as some new and exciting ideas. Starting with the basics, you will learn about what basic equipment you will need, as well as some excellent tips and tricks on how to make the most out of your smoothies. The book is divided into simple smoothies, which feature three to five ingredients, to post-workout favourites, breakfast ideas, energizers, desserts and more. David and Luise will also share their recipes for nut milks and butters, granola, muesli, as well as their favourite juices, which can be added to the smoothie recipes.
