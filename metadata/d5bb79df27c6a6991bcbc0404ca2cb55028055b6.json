Various fields of work are dependent of a computer. When it comes to important documents, a comparison tool might come in handy. There are various applications out there such as Beyond Compare that give you the possibility to easily spot differences in content or technical details, this one offering a little more, just as the name suggests.\n\nIntelligent Comparison\nCompare files and folders using simple, powerful commands that focus on the differences you are interested in and ignore those you are not. Merge changes, synchronize files, and generate reports.\n\nAccess Data Anywhere\nDirectly access FTP sites, media devices, WebDAV resources, svn repositories and cloud storage. All from your Windows, Mac OS X or Linux workstation.\n\nSpecialized Viewers\nBeyond Compare includes built-in comparison viewers for a variety of data types. In addition to text, compare tables, images, binary files, registry hives, and much more.\n\nCompare Files, Folders\nYou can compare entire drives and folders at high speed, checking just sizes and modified times. Or, thoroughly verify every file with byte-by-byte comparisons. FTP sites, cloud storage, and zip files are integrated seamlessly, and powerful filters allow you to limit what you see to only what you're interested in.\n\n3-way Merge (Pro edition only)\nBeyond Compares merge view allows you to combine changes from two versions of a file or folder into a single output. Its intelligent approach allows you to quickly accept most changes while carefully examining conflicts. Color coding and section highlighting allow you to accept, reject, or combine changes, simply and easily. When merging files you can change any line in the output with the built-in syntax-highlighting editor. By using Beyond Compares powerful file type support and ability to favor changes from one file, you can trivially accept many changes without even seeing them\n\nSynchronize Folders\nBeyond Compares intuitive Folder Sync interface lets you reconcile differences in your data automatically. You can efficiently update your laptop, backup your computer, or manage your website, and Beyond Compare will handle all the details. You can copy to and from disks, FTP servers, and zip files, all using the same interface.
