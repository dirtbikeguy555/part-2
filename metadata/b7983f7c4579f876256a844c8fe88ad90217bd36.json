Following his posting of a few primitively recorded tracks to MySpace a few years ago, it wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t long before a local label head came knocking and he was touring the wilds of his native country, barely enough songs behind him to carry a set list.\n\nCut to 2008: following a rapturously received debut album and three nights at the Los Angeles Town Hall in support of Bon Iver, it wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t long before venerable US indie Dead Oceans picked up the young singer. This second effort is the first to receive widespread distribution outside of Scandinavia, and a superb record it is too; a ranging, dusty collection of songs that belie his upbringing in rural Sweden, coming off more peak-era Dylan or early 20th century troubadour than anything else.\n\nMatsson doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t deny these influences (Dylan is right there, listed on his MySpace account), but he hardly fosters them, either. While The Wild Hunt strays from its one-man-and-guitar template only once over the course of its ten songs (perhaps significantly, in the woozy, Springsteen-inflected closer Kids on the Run), it offers plenty in the way of surprises ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ its rough, assured command of melody and intuitive chord sequences veering from chest beating to contemplative in tone.\n\nLyrically, there is so much going on here itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hard to get a handle on. King of Spain sits at the heart of the piece, a swinging, irrepressible number that draws on almost every Iberian clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© going in a bitter swipe at its creatorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own foolhardiness. Although the title-track opens the record on a note of optimism, it is so strewn with elemental, often Biblical imagery ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ indeed, its central motif of departure plays heavy on almost every single song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ that MatssonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s greater, darker concerns are unavoidable.\n\nNevertheless, The Wild Hunt is a heady and enthralling work, its impressionistic nature bolstered by levels of charm and confidence found all too rarely in these modern times.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7983f7c4579f876256a844c8fe88ad90217bd36","amp;dn":"the+Tallest+Man+on+Earth...The+Wild+Hunt%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7983f7c4579f876256a844c8fe88ad90217bd36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,152,63,124,69,121,248,118,37,106,132,76,143,232,138,217,2,23,189,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
