On this disc is a bootable\nWindows XP installation containing many useful tools for PC diagnostics and\nrepair... or anything else you want to use it for. Live XP based on Hiren's XP 10.1\ngives you a working copy of Windows on any bootable PC, even without a hard drive.\nFrom there you can edit the PC's registry offline, run an offline Chkdsk, or run a\nquick offline temp file cleanup with CleanExternal. All sorts of cool offline stuff\nhere.\n\nBut 50mb gave me a little more room to work with. So I added a few DOS-based\nutilities as well, like Spinrite to refresh/repair a hard drive, PTEdit to reveal if\nyour old system is 48-bit LBA compatible (137gb barrier on old IDE systems), and\nKon-Boot to log in to any local account without a password - and without breaking\nthe existing one. Pretty powerful stuff.\n\nSuck on that, Damn Small Linux.\n\nHow'd this all start? Well, I had created a MiniBootCD of the v2.5 F4UBCD to fit on\nan 8cm 185mb CD-R (we had a lot of 'em laying around), and those became the de-facto\nshop standard. Then, I was browsing around and I saw a business-card CD-R that held\n50mb. Well, 50mb was about the size of the raw XP image. Why not try cramming it in\nthere? Cram, I did. But in making it fit, I found some extra free space laying\naround. And I found that I could apply those techniques to other parts of the system\nas well. Next thing I knew, I was thinking of all the useful tools I could cram onto\nthe disc. Instead of wasting space with flat floppy images, they're now cleared and\nGZipped, decompressed on startup with memdisk. And it worked well.\n\nNow you can see what's in store for v2.5 ahead of time. Since this isn't actually\nbeing used officially in shop I can give it to you guys for your consumption.\nHopefully it'll make up for the relatively unpolished v2.0 (by current standards)!\n\nOnce you dive into this disc, you'll never need another boot CD. (tm)\n\nNotes:\n\nCompression of the ISO isn't necessary... everything is so tightly packed, 7z'ing it\nwould only save about 1mb, tops. Better to make it more convenient to use.\n\nThe RAM image fills up fast after booting since it doesn't support file compression\nlike NTFS does. So if you use network support, make sure you do it last, as you'll\nbe likely to have 0 bytes free after starting it. Clear the *.pnf files from\nX:/i386/inf to free some space if needed.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n                                O N   T H E   D I S C                              |\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\nLive XP based on Hiren's XP 10.1\n Includes: HD Tune Pro 4.01, RegEditPE v2.0 Beta, Ghost 11.5, fix_hdc, network\n  support, Keyfinder, NTPWEdit, RemoveWGA, Unstoppable Copier, 7-Zip, and Solitaire\n Tweaks: Desktop icons, Taskmgr as task manager, 1024x768 res, 7-zip instead of UHA\n  compression, FAT32 image filesystem to save space, various other tweaks\nSpinRite 6.0\nPTEdit\nMemtest86+ 4.0\nKon-Boot 1.1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26a189ed2737eb5eb2ddae2a124ab460b57fbd13","amp;dn":"FalconFour%5C%27s+Micro+Boot+CD+2.5+-+Live+XP%2C+Spinrite%2C+Kon-Boot","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26a189ed2737eb5eb2ddae2a124ab460b57fbd13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,161,137,237,39,55,235,94,178,221,174,42,18,74,180,96,181,127,189,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
