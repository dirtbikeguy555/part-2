The unsettling words that she read forever changed the life of this once contented wife and mother; yet this well-intended posthumous missive also becomes the spur that enables Cecilia to connect with two other women recently pushed towards crossroads. A new novel by Liane Moriarty (What Alice Forgot; The Hypnotist's Love) as original and well-crafted as a fine string quartet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da45aa8030020969b7833b4ca290bffca9d3c4f2","amp;dn":"The+Husband%27s+Secret+-+Liane+Moriarty.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da45aa8030020969b7833b4ca290bffca9d3c4f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,69,170,128,48,2,9,105,183,131,59,76,162,144,191,252,169,211,196,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
