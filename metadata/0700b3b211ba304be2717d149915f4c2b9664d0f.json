In recent years it has been named to &quot;best novels&quot; lists by Time, Newsweek, the Modern Library, and the London Observer.\n\nSet in Italy during World War II, this is the story of the incomparable, malingering bombardier, Yossarian, a hero who is furious because thousands of people he has never met are trying to kill him. But his real problem is not the enemy - it is his own army, which keeps increasing the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. Yet if Yossarian makes any attempt to excuse himself from the perilous missions he's assigned, he'll be in violation of Catch-22, a hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule: a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes a formal request to be removed from duty, he is proven sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved.\n\nSince its publication in 1961, no novel has matched Catch-22's intensity and brilliance in depicting the brutal insanity of war. This fiftieth-anniversary edition commemorates Joseph HellerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s masterpiece with a new introduction by Christopher Buckley; personal essays on the genesis of the novel by the author; a wealth of critical responses and reviews by Norman Mailer, Alfred Kazin, Anthony Burgess, and others; rare papers and photos from Joseph HellerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s personal archive; and a selection of advertisements from the original publishing campaign that helped turn Catch-22 into a cultural phenomenon. Here, at last, is the definitive edition of a classic of world literature.\n\nAmazon.com Review\n\nThere was a time when reading Joseph Heller's classic satire on the murderous insanity of war was nothing less than a rite of passage. Echoes of Yossarian, the wise-ass bombardier who was too smart to die but not smart enough to find a way out of his predicament, could be heard throughout the counterculture. As a result, it's impossible not to consider Catch-22 to be something of a period piece. But 40 years on, the novel's undiminished strength is its looking-glass logic. Again and again, Heller's characters demonstrate that what is commonly held to be good, is bad; what is sensible, is nonsense.\n\nYossarian says, &quot;You're talking about winning the war, and I am talking about winning the war and keeping alive.&quot;\n\n&quot;Exactly,&quot; Clevinger snapped smugly. &quot;And which do you think is more important?&quot;\n\n&quot;To whom?&quot; Yossarian shot back. &quot;It doesn't make a damn bit of difference who wins the war to someone who's dead.&quot;\n\n&quot;I can't think of another attitude that could be depended upon to give greater comfort to the enemy.&quot;\n\n&quot;The enemy,&quot; retorted Yossarian with weighted precision, &quot;is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on.&quot;\n\nMirabile dictu, the book holds up post-Reagan, post-Gulf War. It's a good thing, too. As long as there's a military, that engine of lethal authority, Catch-22 will shine as a handbook for smart-alecky pacifists. It's an utterly serious and sad, but damn funny book.\n\n------------------------\n\nI want to express my immense gratitude to the original uploader of this book.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0700b3b211ba304be2717d149915f4c2b9664d0f","amp;dn":"Joseph+Heller+-+Catch-22%3A+50th+Anniversary+Edition+%28epub%2C+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0700b3b211ba304be2717d149915f4c2b9664d0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,0,179,178,17,186,48,75,226,113,125,20,153,21,244,194,185,102,77,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
