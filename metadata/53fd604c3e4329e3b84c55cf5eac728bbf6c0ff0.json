Includes liner notes by Michael Hill.\nDigitally remastered by Bill Lacey.Although this collection's title makes a weighty claim, a tour through\nthis rich box set makes it clear hear how Sam Cooke's fusion of gospel and pop laid the groundwork for such \nseminal soul artists as Otis Redding, Marvin Gaye, Al Green, and more recently Prince and D'Angelo. This\n four-disc collection is divided by era and kicks off with Cooke's initial leap from gospel sensation to \nsecular star.Alongside hits like &quot;You Send Me&quot; and &quot;Only Sixteen&quot; are more obscure cuts like &quot;Desire Me&quot; \nand &quot;You Were Made for Me&quot; that find Cooke managing to make staid, Mitch Miller-like vocal arrangements \nswing. Singles and album cuts from the RCA years (1960 to 1963) make up Discs Two and Three. Highlights\n include well-known classics (&quot;Chain Gang,&quot; &quot;Cupid&quot;), Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole influenced saloon songs \n(&quot;Out in the Cold Again&quot;), and the occasional chestnut with religious roots (&quot;Bring It on Home to Me&quot;).\n Disc Four showcases the albums NIGHT BEAT and LIVE AT THE HARLEM SQUARE CLUB. Throughout these discs,\n Sam Cooke effortlessly tackles various musical genres including blues (&quot;Little Red Rooster&quot;), rock &amp; roll\n (&quot;Shake, Rattle &amp; Roll&quot;), folk (&quot;Frankie and Johnny&quot;), and standards (&quot;Summertime&quot;). \n\n=========================================\n\n[color=red]Tracklist[/color]\n\nDISC 1: \n1.
