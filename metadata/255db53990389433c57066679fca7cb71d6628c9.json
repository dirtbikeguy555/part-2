Boxes are relatively quick to build, require only a small amount of material, and can be made in the smallest of woodshops. And, of course, they make wonderful gifts!\n\nIn this all-new collection of boxes from one of America's premier box makers, Doug Stowe shows how to design and build eight distinctive boxes, in a variety of styles, sizes and techniques. Each chapter illustrates a key design principle--such as harmony, rhythm, texture, or contrast--and includes one or two design variations intended to help box makers grasp their own creative potentials.\n\nThe focus of the book will be on giving the reader creative license to make boxes that are more personal in design. But all design issues aside, this will be a book of beautiful boxes that woodworkers of all levels will be eager to build.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nIntroduction\nChapter 1: Lift Lid Rectangular Box\nChapter 2: Veneered Box\nChapter 3: Finger-Jointed Chest\nChapter 4: Bracelet Box\nChapter 5: Jewelry Box\nChapter 6: Sliding Top Jewelry Presentation Box\nChapter 7: Swivel Lid Box\nChapter 8: Magnetic Tower\nResources\nIndex","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:255db53990389433c57066679fca7cb71d6628c9","amp;dn":"Beautiful+Boxes%3A+Design+and+Technique+-+Doug+Stowe+-+Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"255db53990389433c57066679fca7cb71d6628c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,93,181,57,144,56,148,51,197,112,102,103,159,202,124,183,29,102,40,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
