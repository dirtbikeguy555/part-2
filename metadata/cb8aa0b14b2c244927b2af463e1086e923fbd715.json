You have the following options:\r\n\r\n   A) - Don't edit Custom.ini in PDIR14 Retail Setup folder.\r\n      Just open it copy CD key into CORE keygen serial part.\r\n   B) - Or, Generate your personal serial from keygen and paste it on\r\n      Custom.ini in the main directory of PDIR14 (MyCDKey part)\r\n      and save it. Don't close the keygen, you will use the same\r\n      serial when manual activation prompted.\r\n\r\n    - Install PDIR14.\r\n\r\n    - After install, do not open it.\r\n\r\n    - Go to registry and edit the following path: (Run regedit.exe)\r\n\r\n      Edit PD14  ---&gt;\r\n      UserReg ---&gt;  \r\n      Product Activate --&gt;\r\n      Change to LocalServer --&gt;\r\n      Save .\r\n\r\n      HKLMSOFTWARECyberlinkPowerDirectorUserreg\r\n\r\n      Change Prod_activate from OnlineCheck to LocalServer\r\n\r\n      - After you're done installing. Open PDIR14:\r\n\r\n      - Now import a MKV to get manual activation.\r\n      When prompted, remember the serial you place in Custom.ini\r\n      in the main directory of DS4.\r\n      Paste it into manual activation dialog.\r\n\r\n      - From keygen click on &quot;Get Activation Code&quot;.\r\n      After activation code generated copy it back to activation dialog.\r\n      This way codecs will be enabled.\r\n\r\n      - Same activation stands for other apps in the Suite as well.\r\n      CD, AD, PD will not require anything to activate.\r\n\r\n      More info on how to perform manual activation:\r\n\r\n      - Run Power Director ---&gt;\r\n      Import any .mkv file to initiate the activation dialog.\r\n\r\n      - Click &quot;I don't have an interent connection now.\r\n\r\n      - In the activation dialog click the link and then copy it\r\n      before it changes in your browser's address bar.\r\n      It should look like this:\r\n\r  http://www.cyberlink.com/cae/2581/powerdirector/activation?id=5b16adcd-008\r\n\r\n     - Now paste that link into the keygen and hit 'gen activation.\r\n     Paste that code into the dialog\r\n\r\n     - In the keygen click &quot;Add Online Activation&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                â€¢ Thats it!
