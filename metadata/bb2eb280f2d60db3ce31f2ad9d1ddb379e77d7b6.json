Users are able to import bi-ped, animated skin-bone characters and their animations for use in iClone. They can also export iClone characters and animations to external 3D applications and video game engines. Moreover, 3DXchange 6 is enhanced with an optimized conversion performance and editing environment, ensuring that you an even faster and better user experience!\t\r\n\r\nWhatâ€™s New in 3DXchange 6:\r\n\r\nLarge Model Conversion (OBJ)\r\n3DXchange 6 has Improved stability, allowing models with up to 1,280,000 faces to be imported smoothly. High-polygon OBJ models are now imported much faster than before! \r\n\r\nMerge Identical\r\nThe Merge Identical feature gives users a big performance boost over 3D models composed with multiple meshes sharing identical materials. By combining mesh nodes sharing the same materials into one object, 3DXchange 6 greatly reduces repetitive draw calls for a better real-time performance. (This feature only support .skp files, other formats will be included for later updates.)\r\n\r\nInteractive Lighting &amp; Scene Mode Selection\r\n3DXchange 6 provides 4 different scene modes for users to preview the converted model with enhanced visual preferences. Just like iClone, you can hold the &quot;/ &quot; key to intuitively adjust the light angle for better observation of model details.\r\n\r\nScene Tree Show / Hide\r\nOften, you will have both 3DXchange and iClone open on the same desktop. The Scene Tree on/off toggle gives users flexibility in maximizing the 3D view size while keeping a minimized window scale.\r\n\r\nSmooth LipSync 2.0 - Phoneme Pairs\r\nGet away from jumpy, artificial, one-sound-to-one-shape lip-syncing. Itâ€™s time to give all your 3D characters a more natural talk with this newly introduced phoneme pairing solution. With greatly enhanced mouth movements governed by pairing 8 lip-dental shapes, 7 tongue positions, and mouth width, blended in varied time curves to represent more natural transitions between 240 possible phoneme combinations. The new lip mapping system will be supported in 3DXchange 6.2.\r\n\r\nDirect Access to Free 3D Assets in Sketchup 3D Warehouse\r\nThe most classic and exciting feature of 3DXchange, is that it allows you to get free access to millions of 3D models for prop and scene creation. Now 3DXchange 6 is compatible with all versions of Sketchup files. Simply import any file downloaded from 3D Warehouse, without the hassle of prior format conversion using Sketchup. \r\n\r\nSupport External Tools in the Latest Version\r\nWhether youâ€™re indulging in game development, model build-up, CG design, or motion creation, 3DXchange has been updated to support external tools, to ensure that you enjoy these up-to-date functions. \r\n\r\nSystem Requirements:\r\n- iClone 3DXchange supports Win XP SP2 / Vista / 7 / 8 / 10.\r\n\r\nWhat's new in iClone 3DXchange 6 \nhttp://www.reallusion.com/iClone/3DXchange.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb2eb280f2d60db3ce31f2ad9d1ddb379e77d7b6","amp;dn":"Reallusion+iClone+3DXchange+6.51.1927.1+Pipeline+Incl+Serial+Key","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb2eb280f2d60db3ce31f2ad9d1ddb379e77d7b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,46,178,128,242,214,13,179,206,49,242,173,157,29,219,55,158,119,215,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
