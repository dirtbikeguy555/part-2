Electricity and energy donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to come off the public utility gridÃ¢â‚¬â€alternatives abound in solar, wind, and water generated power. Design decisions can drastically affect power consumption, and bio-diesel and alternative fuels can help break the oil habit. Dave Black describes alternatives for eco-pimping your home and lifestyle for independence, economy, and a more integrated way of life. Equally valuable for the urban dweller vaguely concerned about the size of his or her carbon footprint and the rural self-sufficiency enthusiast, Living Off the Grid can help anyone take control of his or her life and way of living.\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n Dave Black is an internationally recognized consultant in emergency planning and disaster response. With nearly twenty years of experience in search and rescue and as a wilderness and urban first responder, he has served as a consultant and architect of community disaster response and management systems both here and abroad","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2839c5fbbd776c7b2c12cc43468cbd4416b2a9bc","amp;dn":"Living+Off+the+Grid+-+David+Black","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2839c5fbbd776c7b2c12cc43468cbd4416b2a9bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,57,197,251,189,119,108,123,44,18,204,67,70,140,189,68,22,178,169,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
