Like many, I knew of a handful of catchy, rockin' songs from classic rock radio and mp3 downloads. I was also somewhat confused as why not one retrospective had songs from their early and latter days on it, then I found out it was due to them changing labels in the mid-80s. This is the only Aerosmith compilation to feature songs from their Columbia and Geffen days on it and it makes a great buy for people who are interested in exploring their back catalogue, or just want those famous radio hits. \nA seasoned Aerosmith fan might want this for the bonus tracks, the Run D.M.C. version of 'Walk This Way' and the two new songs, the single, 'Girls Of Summer' and the ballad 'Lay It Down. This also features the single from the Armageddon movie, 'I Don't Want To Miss A Thing.' A diehard might already have the soundtrack for that song or even the Run D.M.C. cd too but they're always nice to have grouped with other Aerosmith material. The remastered sound is loud and clear, a definite plus for audiophiles. The only glaring errors I see off-hand are the omissions of the popular 'Eat The Rich,' 'Toys In The Attic,' and their cover of 'Come Together,' songs even a beginner like me has heard on the radio. The latter two appear on the European import of this same compilation, but unfortunately you have to pay that European import price. Why the domestic release left those two songs off is beyond me. Aside from those minor negatives, this is the definitive Aerosmith compilation for beginners interested in America's ultimate rock 'n roll band. \n\nby Eric Edelin\n\nTRACKLIST: \nDisc 1:\n\n01 - Mama Kin.wma                                                \n02 - Dream On.wma                                                \n03 - Same Old Song And Dance.wma                                 \n04 - Seasons Of Wither.wma                                       \n05 - Walk The Way.wma                                            \n06 - Big Ten-Inch Record.wma                                     \n07 - Sweet Emotion.wma                                           \n08 - Last Child.wma                                              \n09 - Back In The Saddle.wma                                      \n10 - Draw The Line.wma                                           \n11 - Dude (Looks Like A Lady).wma                                \n12 - Angel.wma                                                   \n13 - Rag Doll.wma                                                \n14 - Janie's Got A Gun.wma                                       \n15 - Love In An Elevator.wma                                     \n16 - What It Takes.wma     \n\nDisc 2:\n\n01 - The Other Side.wma                                          \n02 - Livin' On The Edge.wma                                      \n03 - Cryin'.wma                                                  \n04 - Amazing.wma                                                 \n05 - Deuces Are Wild.wma                                         \n06 - Crazy.wma                                                   \n07 - Falling In Love (Is Hard On The Knees).wma                  \n08 - Pink (The South Beach Mix).wma                              \n09 - I Don't Want To Miss A Thing.wma                            \n10 - Jaded.wma                                                   \n11 - Just Push Play (Radio Remix).wma                            \n12 - Walk This Way (Performed By Run Dmc).wma                    \n13 - Girls Of Summer.wma                                         \n14 - Lay It Down.wma                                             \n15 - Come Together.wma                                           \n16 - Theme From Spiderman.wma                                    \n17 - Toys In The Attic.wma  \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2888601fd1da84bf53c182df46a12491fcece9c3","amp;dn":"Aerosmith+-+O%2C+Yeah%21+Ultimate+Aerosmith+Hits+%282002%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2888601fd1da84bf53c182df46a12491fcece9c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,136,96,31,209,218,132,191,83,193,130,223,70,161,36,145,252,236,233,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
