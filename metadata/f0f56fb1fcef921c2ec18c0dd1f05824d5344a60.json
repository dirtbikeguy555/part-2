Following the demise of an earlier, conspicuously synth pop-based outfit named Empire, the Hawkins brothers sowed the seeds of what would become the Darkness at an impromptu karaoke session on New Year's Eve 1999. Justin's rapturous rendition of Queen's &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; showed them the way, and the suitably dramatic name of the Darkness was chosen shortly after the arrival of Poullain and Graham. \n\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\nPermission To Land (2003)\n\n\n01.Black Shuck\n02.Get Your Hands Off My Woman\n03.Growing On Me\n04.I Believe In A Thing Called Love\n05.Love Is Only A Feeling\n06.Givin' Up\n07.Stuck In A Rut\n08.Friday Night\n09.Love On The Rocks With No Ice\n10.Holding My Own\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nLabel:\t\t\tAtlantic\nCatalog:\t\t82564-60817-21\n\n\n\n\nOne Way Ticket To Hell...And Back (2005)\n\n\n01.One Way Ticket\n02.Knockers\n03.Is It Just Me?\n04.Dinner Lady Arms\n05.Seemed Like A Good Idea At The Time\n06.Hazel Eyes\n07.Bald\n08.Girlfriend\n09.English Country Garden\n10.Blind Man\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nLabel:\t\t\tAtlantic\nCatalog:\t\t5051011 1218 2 1\n\n\n\n\nHot Cakes (Bonus Tracks) (2012)\n\n\n01.Every Inch Of You\n02.Nothin's Gonna Stop Us\n03.With A Woman\n04.Keep Me Hangin' On\n05.Living Every Day Blind\n06.Everybody Have A Good Time\n07.She's Just A Girl, Eddie\n08.Forbidden Love\n09.Concrete\n10.Street Spirit (Fade Out)\n11.Love Is Not The Answer\n12.I Can't Believe It's Not Love (Acoustic Demo) (Bonus Track)*\n13.Love Is Not The Answer (Acoustic Demo) (Bonus Track)*\n14.Pat Pong Ladies (Demo Mix) (Bonus Track)*\n15.Cannonball (Long Version) (Feat.
