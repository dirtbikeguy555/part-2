After Kursk, this was the most significant struggle of the two tank armies and resulted in the complete destruction of the German Army Group Center and the Soviet recapture of all territories within their 1941 borders.\n\nThe player can experience the battlefield from within the Russian T-34 and the German ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTigerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, with fully animated 3D interiors and playable Driver, Gunner and Commander positions. The tanksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ dynamics include realistic physics, accurate ballistics and elaborate damage models. Interior models feature historically accurate gun-sight optics.\n\nThe vast Belarusian landscape of the early 20th century, with its rolling hills, villages and large forests was carefully recreated from historical reference photos and maps. The rich battlefield environment includes AI controlled Russian and German tanks, infantry, armored-personnel-carriers, anti-tank-guns and airplanes.\n\nStunning special effects, such as explosions, fires and smoke, the ability to completely destroy vehicles and buildings, all combine to create a lifelike combat environment. The action can be viewed from various camera angles in first or third person view.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“WWII Battle Tanks: T-34 vs. TigerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ includes two single-player campaigns and two multiplayer modes (skirmish and team-play) for LAN and Internet play for up to 16 players.  \n==============================================================\nMoRe iNsTaLL NoTeS\n\nSystem Requirements\n\nMinimum Configuration:\n\n*** OS: Microsoft Windows XP/Windows Vista\n*** CPU: 3.0 GHz\n*** RAM: 1 GB (2 GB for Vista)\n*** 2GB of free Harddisk space\n*** nVidia GeForce 6600 or ATI Radeon 9600 (128 MB)\n*** DirectX 9 Compatible Sound Card\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e7beb21b24f72f135b753b5b61a45058a4381e9","amp;dn":"WWII+Battle+Tanks%3A+T-34+vs.+Tiger-FLT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e7beb21b24f72f135b753b5b61a45058a4381e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,123,235,33,178,79,114,241,53,183,83,181,182,26,69,5,138,67,129,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
