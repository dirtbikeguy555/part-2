The organic gardening system that has resulted from Paul GautschiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s incredible experiences has garnered the interest of visitors from around the world. Never, until now, have PaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s organic gardening methods been documented and shared like this!\n\nAfter years of back-breaking toil in ground ravaged by the effects of man-made growing systems, Paul Gautschi has discovered a taste of what God intended for mankind in the garden of Eden. Some of the vital issues facing agriculture today include soil preparation, fertilization, irrigation, weed control, pest control, crop rotation, and PH issues. None of these issues exist in the unaltered state of nature or in Paul's gardens and orchards. &quot;Back to Eden&quot; invites you to take a walk with Paul as he teaches you sustainable organic growing methods that are capable of being implemented in diverse climates around the world.\n\nSince its release in August 2011, Back to Eden has been viewed online over 1.8 million times in 210 countries!
