The form was chosen so that the route each pioneer followed could be plotted in detail; and the maps showing the explorers' journeys are augmented by others, picturing the world as it was thought to be in the time of the explorers, and showing political and geographical features of their day. The maps are linked and amplified by the text, which describes the discoverers, their motives, and their explorations into the unknown world.\nIn an introduction compiled posthumously from the writings of Sir Francis Chichester, one of the present century's greatest adventurers. Sir Francis describes the search for challenge and achievement that was the moving spirit of his life, and of the  lives of many of the explorers who have helped to open up the world. Thereafter, first in chronological, then in geographical framework, the history of discovery unfolds. From the first wanderings of primitive men, and civilization's earliest recorded expeditions, it leads through the epic journeys of exploration to man's latest adventureÃ¢â‚¬â€the space flights of the present century","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1965de05213457be449371604f348e941f93f8e7","amp;dn":"Atlas+of+discovery+%28Maps+History+Geography+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1965de05213457be449371604f348e941f93f8e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,101,222,5,33,52,87,190,68,147,113,96,79,52,142,148,31,147,248,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
