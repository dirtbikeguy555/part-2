Her sultry voice wraps around her melodies, enveloping the listener. Her lyrics are rife with a plainspoken yet cutthroat honesty, putting a pain in your heart that feels good. And her chordings, distinct, original and timeless nonetheless, reveal a songwriting craftsman already well on her way to establishing a niche her very own. Seriously, y'all, get into Lera Lynn.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3eb2e218c866b472121cf9f1ed6188d23da06dc8","amp;dn":"Lera+Lynn+-+Have+You+Met+Lera+Lynn%3F+%5B2011%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3eb2e218c866b472121cf9f1ed6188d23da06dc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,178,226,24,200,102,180,114,18,28,249,241,237,97,136,210,61,160,109,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
