The band recorded two albums in 1988 and 1990, though Orbison \ndied before the second was recorded.\nStarting with a meal among Harrison, Lynne and Roy Orbison, the group came together at Bob Dylan's home studio in Malibu,\n California, to record an additional track as a B-side for the single release of Harrison's &quot;This Is Love&quot;. Tom Petty's\n involvement came by chance, as Harrison had left his guitar at Petty's house and Harrison went to get it and Petty came back \nwith him.The record label, however, decided that the song that resulted, &quot;Handle with Care&quot;, was too good to be released as a \n&quot;single filler&quot;. The members enjoyed working together so much that they decided to create a full album together.\n Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1. Written by all five men, it was recorded over a ten-day period in May 1988, and released on October \n18. The album was recorded in the house and garden of Eurythmics member Dave Stewart.The &quot;Wilburys&quot; joke was extended further,\n with the band members credited under various pseudonyms and pretending to be half-brothers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ sons of a fictional Charles\n Truscott Wilbury, Sr.The album was a critical and commercial success, spawning several successful singles and eventually \nreaching triple-platinum sales status in the US. The album was nominated for several awards and won the Grammy Award for Best\n Rock Performance by a Duo or Group in 1989. Liner notes on the album cover were written by Michael Palin under a pseudonym. On \nthe second album they were written by Eric Idle under a pseudonym.\n\n============================================\n\nTracklist\n\n01 - Handle With Care.flac\n02 - Dirty World.flac\n03 - Rattled.flac\n04 - Last Night.flac\n05 - Not Alone Any More.flac\n06 - Congratulations.flac\n07 - Heading For The Light.flac\n08 - Margarita.flac\n09 - Tweeter And The Monkey Man.flac\n10 - End Of The Line.flac\n\n==========================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 1.40 GB\nAlbum                                    : Volume One\nTrack name/Total                         : 10\nPerformer                                : Traveling Wilburys\nGenre                                    : Classic Rock \nRecorded date                            : 1988\n\n====================================\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                                   : FLAC\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 5 563 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 192 KHz\nBit depth                                : 24 bits\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9880f188aec06ad8575f13f8a794d30c1a0ce835","amp;dn":"Traveling+Wilburys+Volume+1+%281988%29+FLAC%5B24+Bit+192+KHz+Vinyl%5D+++","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9880f188aec06ad8575f13f8a794d30c1a0ce835","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,128,241,136,174,192,106,216,87,95,19,248,167,148,211,12,26,12,232,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
