Armed with wit, a pencil-thin mustache, and a cardboard sign that reads &quot;IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Not Psycho&quot;, he hitchhikes across America from Baltimore to San Francisco, braving lonely roads and treacherous drivers. But who should we be more worried about, the delicate film director with genteel manners or the unsuspecting travelers transporting the Pope of Trash?\n\nBefore he leaves for this bizarre adventure, Waters fantasizes about the best and worst possible scenarios: A friendly drug dealer hands over piles of cash to finance films with no questions asked, a demolition-derby driver makes a filthy sexual request in the middle of a race, a gun-toting drunk terrorizes and holds him hostage, and a Kansas vice squad entraps and throws him in jail. So what really happens when this cult legend sticks out his thumb and faces the open road? His real-life rides include a gentle 81-year-old farmer who is convinced Waters is a hobo, an indie band on tour, and the perverse filmmakerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unexpected hero: A young, sandy-haired Republican in a Corvette.\n\nLaced with subversive humor and warm intelligence, Carsick is an unforgettable vacation with a wickedly funny companion - and a celebration of AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s weird, astonishing, and generous citizenry.
