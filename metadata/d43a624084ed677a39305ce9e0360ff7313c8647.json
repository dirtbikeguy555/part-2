Released as the lead\nsingle from the album in November 1992, the song reached number 25 on the UK\nSingles Chart and in 2009 became the official Christmas Number 1.\n\nWritten about revolution against corruption in society, &quot;Killing in the Name&quot; is\nwidely recognised as the band's signature song, and has been noted for its\ndistinctive guitar riffs and heavy use of strong language.\n\nIn 2009 the song was part of a successful Facebook campaign to prevent The X\nFactor winner's song from gaining the Christmas number one in the UK. The\ncampaign provoked commentary from both groups and other musicians, as well as\ngaining coverage in national press. The song became the first single to reach\nnumber one spot on downloads alone...[MP3 @ 320]\n\n[img]http://img686.imageshack.us/img686/7181/tree541.gif[/img]\n[img]http://img695.imageshack.us/img695/5314/usualsuspects.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://img5.imageshack.us/img5/5275/mp3logor.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d43a624084ed677a39305ce9e0360ff7313c8647","amp;dn":"Rage+Against+the+Machine-Killing+in+the+Name%5BFLAC+%26+Mp3%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d43a624084ed677a39305ce9e0360ff7313c8647","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,58,98,64,132,237,103,122,57,48,92,233,224,54,15,247,49,60,134,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
