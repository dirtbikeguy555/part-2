It features an acoustic performance taped at Sony Music Studios in New York City on November 18, 1993 for the television series MTV Unplugged. The show was directed by Beth McCarthy and first aired on the cable television network MTV on December 14, 1993. As opposed to traditional practice on the television series, Nirvana played a setlist composed of mainly lesser-known material and cover versions of songs by The Vaselines, David Bowie, Meat Puppets (during which they were joined by two members of the group onstage) and Lead Belly.\n\nMTV Unplugged in New York was the first Nirvana album released in the wake of the April 1994 suicide of singer/guitarist Kurt Cobain. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, and has become the groups most successful posthumous release, selling five million copies in America by 1997. It was hailed by critics as proof the band was able to transcend the grunge sound they were commonly associated with. MTV Unplugged in New York includes two songs which were not aired on the original television broadcast of the concert: *Something in the Way* and *Oh, Me*. The album won a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. In 2003 it was ranked number 311 on Rolling Stones list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n\n\n\nTrack listing\n\nSide 1\n\n      1. About A Girl (3:38)\n      2.
