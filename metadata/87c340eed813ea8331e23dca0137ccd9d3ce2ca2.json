And has the zenith of Western power now passed? Acclaimed historian Niall Ferguson argues that beginning in the fifteenth century, the West developed six powerful new concepts, or Ã¢â‚¬Å“killer applicationsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€competition, science, the rule of law, modern medicine, consumerism, and the work ethicÃ¢â‚¬â€that the Rest lacked, allowing it to surge past all other competitors.\nYet now, Ferguson shows how the Rest have downloaded the killer apps the West once monopolized, while the West has literally lost faith in itself. Chronicling the rise and fall of empires alongside clashes (and fusions) of civilizations, Civilization: The West and the Rest recasts world history with force and wit. Boldly argued and teeming with memorable characters, this is Ferguson at his very best.\nGenre: Non-Fiction / General","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87c340eed813ea8331e23dca0137ccd9d3ce2ca2","amp;dn":"Civilization_+The+West+and+the+Rest+-+Niall+Ferguson.epub+RE-UP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87c340eed813ea8331e23dca0137ccd9d3ce2ca2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,195,64,238,216,19,234,131,49,226,61,202,1,55,204,217,211,206,44,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
