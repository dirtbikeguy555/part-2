Hibernate, the most popular Java persistence tool, provides automatic and transparent object/relational mapping making it a snap to work with SQL databases in Java applications. Hibernate applications are cheaper, more portable, and more resilient to change. Because it conforms to the new EJB 3.0 and Java Persistence 1.0 standard, Hibernate allows the developer to seamlessly create efficient, scalable Java EE applications.\n\nJava Persistence with Hibernate explores Hibernate by developing an application that ties together hundreds of individual examples. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll immediately dig into the rich programming model of Hibernate 3.2 and Java Persistence, working through queries, fetching strategies, caching, transactions, conversations, and more. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also appreciate the well-illustrated discussion of best practices in database design, object/relational mapping, and optimization techniques.\n\nIn this revised edition of the bestselling Hibernate in Action, authors Christian Bauer and Gavin King-the founder of the Hibernate project-cover Hibernate 3.2 in detail along with the EJB 3.0 and Java Persistence standard.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a033ba4fafe0deab41bf982293acb3684f890f7","amp;dn":"Java+Persistence+With+Hibernate+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a033ba4fafe0deab41bf982293acb3684f890f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,3,59,164,250,254,13,234,180,27,249,130,41,58,203,54,132,248,144,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
