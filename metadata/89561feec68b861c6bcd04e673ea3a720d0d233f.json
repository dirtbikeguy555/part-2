His exploits as a piano-thumping, egocentric wild man with an unquenchable thirst for living have become the fodder for numerous biographies, film documentaries, and a full-length Hollywood movie. Certainly few other artists came to the party with more ego and talent than he and lived to tell the tale. And certainly even fewer could successfully channel that energy into their music and prosper doing it as well as Jerry Lee. When he broke on the national scene in 1957 with his classic &quot;Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On,&quot; he was every parents' worst nightmare perfectly realized: a long, blonde-haired Southerner who played the piano and sang with uncontrolled fury and abandon, while simultaneously reveling in his own sexuality. He was rock &amp; roll's first great wild man and also rock &amp; roll's first great eclectic. Ignoring all manner of musical boundaries is something that has not only allowed his music to have wide variety, but to survive the fads and fashions as well. Whether singing a melancholy country ballad, a lowdown blues, or a blazing rocker, Lewis' wholesale commitment to the moment brings forth performances that are totally grounded in his personality and all singularly of one piece. Like the recordings of Hank Williams, Louis Armstrong, and few others, Jerry Lee's early recorded work is one of the most amazing collections of American music in existence.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\n02.Great Balls Of Fire\n03.Breathless\n04.High School Confidential\n05.What'd I Say\n06.Drinkin' Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee\n07.Matchbox\n08.Jambalaya (On The Bayou)\n09.When The Saints Go Marching In\n10.Lewis Boogie\n11.It'll Be Me (Single Version)\n12.All Night Long\n13.Big Blon' Baby\n14.Crazy Arms\n15.Ubangi Stomp\n16.Big Legged Woman\n17.Put Me Down\n18.Real Wild Child (Wild One)\n\n\nLace up your boogie woogie shoes tight for this one.
