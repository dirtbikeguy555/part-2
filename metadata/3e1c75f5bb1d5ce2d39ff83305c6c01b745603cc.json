The first 12&quot; album recorded by Sinatra, Wee Small Hours was more focused and concentrated than his two earlier concept records. It's a blue, melancholy album, built around a spare rhythm section featuring a rhythm guitar, celesta, and Bill Miller's piano, with gently aching strings added every once and a while. Within that melancholy mood is one of Sinatra's most jazz-oriented performances -- he restructures the melody and Miller's playing is bold throughout the record. Where Songs for Young Lovers! emphasized the romantic aspects of the songs, Sinatra sounds like a lonely, broken man on In the Wee Small Hours. Beginning with the newly written title song, the singer goes through a series of standards that are lonely and desolate. In many ways, the album is a personal reflection of the heartbreak of his doomed love affair with actress Ava Gardner, and the standards that he sings form their own story when collected together. Sinatra's voice had deepened and worn to the point where his delivery seems ravished and heartfelt, as if he were living the songs. \n\n.: Locandina :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1.ytimg.com/vi/KCfPug4bg0o/hqdefault.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1.ytimg.com/vi/KCfPug4bg0o/hqdefault.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Tracklist :.\n\nLato A\n\nIn the Wee Small Hours of the Morning - 3:00 - (Hilliard, Mann)\nMood Indigo - 3:30 - (Bigard, Ellington, Mills)\nGlad to Be Unhappy - 2:35 - (Hart, Rodgers)\nI Get Along Without You Very Well (Except Sometimes) - 3:42 - (Carmichael, Thompson)\nDeep in a Dream - 2:49 - (DeLange, Van Heusen)\nI See Your Face Before Me - 3:24 - (Dietz, Schwartz)\nCan't We Be Friends? - 2:48 - (James, Swift)\nWhen Your Lover Has Gone - 3:10 - (Swan)\n\nLato B\n\nWhat Is This Thing Called Love? - 2:35 - (Porter)\nLast Night When We Were Young - 3:17 - (Arlen, Harburg)\nI'll Be Around - 2:59 - (Wilder)\nIll Wind - 3:46 - (Arlen, Koehler)\nIt Never Entered My Mind - 2:42 - (Hart, Rodgers)\nDancing in the Ceiling - 2:57 - (Hart, Rodgers)\nI'll Never Be the Same - 3:05 - (Kahn, Malneck, Signorelli)\nThis Love of Mine - 3:33 - (Parker, Sanicola, Sinatra)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e1c75f5bb1d5ce2d39ff83305c6c01b745603cc","amp;dn":"Frank+Sinatra+-+In+the+Wee+Small+Hours+%5BMP3+320%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e1c75f5bb1d5ce2d39ff83305c6c01b745603cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,28,117,245,187,29,92,226,211,159,248,51,5,198,192,27,116,86,3,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
