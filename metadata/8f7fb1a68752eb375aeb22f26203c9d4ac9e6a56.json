His low cut twang with beautiful lyrics and equality stunning musical talent, Brody truly is someone were going to hear a lot from. He can make you laugh, cry, sing and listen, a talent which comes only once in a blue moon and 2012 brings this greatly talented country boy back into the spotlight with his album Ã¢â‚¬ËœDirtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\nWhether its Friday night or a quiet one in, Dean Brody has you covered. Born from dirt, back to dirt, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what you do in-between which only truly matters, Ã¢â‚¬ËœDirtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ showing this all to show well. The beautiful story told through track three, Ã¢â‚¬ËœUnderneath the Apple TreesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ will make you listen every time while tracks like Ã¢â‚¬ËœCanadian GirlsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœitÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s FridayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ will make you want to sing-along. The diverse effect of this album means one minute youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re reevaluating your life while the next your excited about just getting out there and having fun. Either or, Dean Brody inspires every part of you to get up and do something with Ã¢â‚¬ËœDirtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\nVery rarely does such a talented storyteller emerge in the music industry, so we need to embrace them when they so appear.

Ã¢â‚¬ËœDirtÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ truly is a storytellers journey, an artistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s passionate expression about love, life and everything in-between; because hey, like Brody says, we come from dirt and all that matters is the middle.
