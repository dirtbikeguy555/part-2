Formerly seen as too complicated and amorphous to be included in early textbooks on the science of cognition, the study of thinking and reasoning has since taken off, branching off in a distinct direction from the field from which it originated.\nThe Oxford Handbook of Thinking and Reasoning is a comprehensive and authoritative handbook covering all the core topics of the field of thinking and reasoning. Written by the foremost experts from cognitive psychology, cognitive science, and cognitive neuroscience, individual chapters summarize basic concepts and findings for a major topic, sketch its history, and give a sense of the directions in which research is currently heading. Chapters include introductions to foundational issues and methods of study in the field, as well as treatment of specific types of thinking and reasoning and their application in a broad range of fields including business, education, law, medicine, music, and science. The volume will be of interest to scholars and students working in developmental, social and clinical psychology, philosophy, economics, artificial intelligence, education, and linguistics.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\n&quot;This rich and complex book tackles the vagaries of the mind in a neuroscientific framework, but it is not a survey or introductory manual to be read casually. It requires an intense passion for studying this area and in-depth understanding of the concepts to truly reap its rewards.&quot; -- DOODY'S\n\n&quot;This is an excellent volume on the growing field of thinking and reasoning, now a part of high-level human cognition which includes creative thinking, decision making and problem solving. These have of late become increasingly important areas of inquiry and scientific research.\nThe better we understand ourselves and others, the happier are the lives we can lead. The editors and contributors therefore deserve to be applauded for this monumental work which contributes immensely to understanding ourselves and our thoughts.&quot; -- BizIndia\n\n&quot;This comprehensive treatment of human thinking should be of value to anyone who is interested in human cognition and the many ways in which it can be conceptualized, modeled, and studied. Holyoak and Morrison in the Oxford Handbook also provide suggestions for organizing the chapters in the book for use as a text for advanced undergraduates (very advanced, I'd add) and graduate students. All of these potential readers should find many issues worth thinking about in the 836 pages of this book.&quot; -- PsycCRITIQUES\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nKeith J. Holyoak is a Distinguished Professor of Psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles. Robert G. Morrison, Ph.D., is Assistant Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Loyola University Chicago.\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f87e06ac15fe17ad78400a78a9eacb1de4f0743","amp;dn":"Keith+J.+Holyoak+-+The+Oxford+Handbook+of+Thinking+and+Reasoning","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f87e06ac15fe17ad78400a78a9eacb1de4f0743","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,135,224,106,193,95,225,122,215,132,0,167,138,158,172,177,222,79,7,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
