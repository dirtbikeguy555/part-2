I installed it through Crossover Games, and when I start it tells me its version 1.142 (weird..)... anyway, I have no idea if the file mbreg.exe is needed or not, or even if it is a virus. Anyone with a Windows, please let me know.\n\nSo,\n\nStep 1 - Update to the 1.143 version using the mb_warband_upgrade_1100_to_1143.exe\n\nStep 2 - In the game folder, replace the file mb_warband.exe with the cracked version just downloaded. Put in the game folder the mbreg.exe. As I said, i don't know if you need to run it or not..\n\nJust try it out, but make sure to run it through your anti-virus...\n\nhave fun!
