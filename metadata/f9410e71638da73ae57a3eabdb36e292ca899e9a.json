Born in the South Bay area of Los Angeles, Jennifer Lee's attention turned from classical piano lessons to making left-field recordings with an SP-404 and Fruityloops software. In college, as her love of hip-hop continued to blossom, she signed up for the Beat Cipher, a monthly open-mike night for beatmakers run by Project Blowed. Monthly performances there led to a meeting with Steven Ellison (aka Flying Lotus), and her progressive, textural beats secured her a spot on his label Brainfeeder. Although her loyalties remained with the hotbed of producers in that clique, she went outside L.A. to release her debut EP, 2009's Cosmic Intoxication, on London imprint Ramp Recordings and followed it with 2010's Midnight Menu for Listen Up Records, a subsidiary of Japanese indie Art Union. Around this time, Lee was also active in several side projects, making music with a tropical flavor as Mama Toquilla, electro as Tokitronm, and collaborating with Suzi Analogue as Analogue Monsta. In 2011, she released the Creature Dreams EP, back on Brainfeeder, and announced plans for a new full-length in 2012.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9410e71638da73ae57a3eabdb36e292ca899e9a","amp;dn":"Tokimonsta+-+Half+Shadows+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9410e71638da73ae57a3eabdb36e292ca899e9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,65,14,113,99,141,167,58,229,122,62,171,219,54,226,146,202,137,158,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
