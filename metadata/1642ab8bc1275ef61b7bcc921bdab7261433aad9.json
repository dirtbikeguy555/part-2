Despite the high expectations that come with such achievement, Radio Music Society delivers, displaying the versatility of her musicianship and vision, such as the soliloquy to spice ÃƒÂ´Cinnamon TreeÃƒÂ¶ with its Joe Satriani-esque guitar flourishes and the artfully arranged cover of MJÃƒâ€ s ÃƒÂ´I CanÃƒâ€ t Help It,ÃƒÂ¶ on which she collaborates with jazz saxophonist Joe Lovano. Every song on the deluxe version of Radio Music Society has a corresponding video.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01. Radio Song  (06:32), 15.08 MB\n02. Cinnamon Tree  (05:36), 12.94 MB\n03.
