It\\\\\\&amp;#039;s rooted in the sorts of 3D platforming sensibilities we\\\\\\&amp;#039;ve all come to know over the years. But there\\\\\\&amp;#039;s a spin to the game--its psychic theme--which adds some cool puzzle-solving to the usual platform-jumping and swinging associated with the genre. Psychonauts also bears the unmistakable mark of designer Tim Schafer (known for classic adventure games Grim Fandango, Full Throttle, and Day of the Tentacle), thanks to a hilarious array of peculiar characters and a story that never fails to entertain. Psychonauts doesn\\\\\\&amp;#039;t reinvent the platformer, but it still delivers an experience that feels wholly original in every aspect of its execution.\n\nFull game : no-cd fix included\n\n\nInstructions:\n\nMount or burn to dvd\nInstall the game\nReplace the original EXE file with the crack.\nPlay the Game!\n\n--------------------\ntracker was down so added tpb and uploaded. the previous peers please download this or add the http://vip.tracker.thepiratebay.se/announce as another tracker to ur current downloads. thanks.
