(1952)\nVittorio De Sica\nCriterion Spine# 201\n\nThere's already a rip for this film at tpb, but in my opinion the size is too big (1.8 GB). This film has monaural audio and is black-and-white, so I think this 1-CD rip will suffice for most pruposes. The film as such needs no introduction, it is one of the most famous neo-realist films by Zavattini and De Sica, both of whom were nominated for awards.\n\n---=Wiki=----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUmberto D. is a 1952 Italian neorealist film, directed by Vittorio de Sica. Most of the actors were non-professional, including Carlo Battisti, who plays the title role. It tells the story of Umberto Domenico Ferrari (Carlo Battisti), an old man in Rome who is desperately trying to keep his apartment on a small state pension, but whose landlady (Lina Gennari) is attempting to drive out to fit her social lifestyle. He tries to find the money but is unwilling to beg to his richer friends, and cannot be helped by his only true friends, a pregnant maid (Maria-Pia Casilio) and his dog, Flike (called 'Flag' in some subtitled versions of the film).\n\n---=Rip Info=------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t---=Audio=-------------------------------------\n\t0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\n\t48000Hz  128 kb/s tot , Joint Stereo \n\tInterleave: 83 ms, preload 504\n\t\n\t---=Video=-------------------------------------\n\t528 x 400 @ 23.976 fps, XviD\n\t1:29:08, 128,208 frames\n\tQf 0.191/965 kbps\n\n\t---=Size=--------------------------------------\n\t733,671,424 bytes (128,208 frames)\n\n\t---=Subtitles=---------------------------------\n\tSRT in English included.\n\t\t\n\t---=Credits=-----------------------------------\n\tThanks to Tansir and friends at DVD World\n\tRip and subtitles by -=:ZEiNAB:=-\n\t\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
