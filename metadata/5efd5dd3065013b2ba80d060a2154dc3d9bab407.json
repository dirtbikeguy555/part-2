However, performing periodic scans and cleaning can keep your PC in good shape. One of the applications that can aid in this situation is CCleaner, equipped with all tools needed to scrub every bit of your computer.\n\n\nCleverly organized interface\n\nLaunching the application brings up a cleverly simple interface, intuitive enough to let anyone instantly accommodate. Major functions are stored in tabs found in a side panel, an upper part constantly displays system info, while the rest of the space is dedicated to actual options you get to handle.\n\n\nEasily get rid of junk files\n\nThe Ã¢â‚¬Å“CleanerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ feature helps you get rid of various files that are no longer of use or take up disk space for no further reason. Two tabs let you select either Windows features or specific applications, each with its own list of areas to be cleaned. Amongst others you are able to select recent documents, autocomplete history, saved passwords, cookies or even old Windows installations.\n\nYou can simply analyze an area to see what needs cleaning so that you don't accidentally remove any important files. The scan process, as well as the scrubbing is done incredibly fast, with post-process details displayed.\n\n\nHave broken registries fixed\n\nFurthermore, you are also able to fix registry issues with the help of a dedicated tool. Similarly to the cleaner, there are several selectable areas, such as missing shared DLLs, ActiveX and Class Issues, obsolete software, start menu ordering or Windows services.\n\n\nMultiple tools to work with\n\nThe application's usability does not end here, because more tools are available under the homonimous tab. An integrated uninstaller lets you safely remove applications so that they leave no traces, startup items can also be deleted, as well as browser add-ons or extensions and even context menu processes.\nWhat's more, system restore points can be viewed in a list, with the possibility to have them removed for a little extra space or comfort. Last but not least, you can choose to wipe an entire drive, be it internal or removable, with the possibility to select either free space or whole drive, as well as the security level.\n\n\nv5.09.5343 (25 Aug 2015)\n\nImproved Microsoft Edge cleaning.\nFaster UI and styling improvements.\nImproved Windows 10 Registry detection and cleaning.\nImproved Internet Explorer 11 DOMStore cleaning.\nOptimized 64-bit build architecture for Windows 10.\nImproved Paint.NET and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware cleaning.\nImproved localization and language support.\nMinor bug fixes.\n\n\nHomerpage: http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner\nChangelog: http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/version-history\nThe Piratebay: https://thepiratebay.la/user/rubberboy37/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5efd5dd3065013b2ba80d060a2154dc3d9bab407","amp;dn":"CCleaner+5.09.5343+Proffesional+%2B+Serials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5efd5dd3065013b2ba80d060a2154dc3d9bab407","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,253,93,211,6,80,19,178,186,128,208,96,162,21,77,195,217,186,180,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
