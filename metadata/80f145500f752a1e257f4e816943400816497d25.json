This practical approach provides readers with an understanding of the logic behind the statistics, so they understand why and how certain methods are used--rather than simply carry out techniques by rote. Readers move beyond number crunching to discover the meaning of statistical results and appreciate how the statistical test to be employed relates to the research questions posed by an experiment. An abundance of real data and research studies provide a real-life perspective and help you understand concepts as you learn about the analysis of data.\n\nAbout the Author\nDavid C. Howell is a professor emeritus and former chair of the psychology department at the University of Vermont. Professor Howell's primary area of research is in statistics and experimental methods. He is also the author of STATISTICAL METHODS FOR PSYCHOLOGY, currently in an Eighth Edition (Wadsworth Cengage Learning, 2013), and the ENCYCLOPEDIA OF STATISTICS IN BEHAVIOR SCIENCE (2005) with Brian Everitt. Before retiring, he frequently served as consultant with other faculty, both in the psychology department and in departments as disparate as Geology and Animal Sciences, and brings those experiences to this endeavor. Professor Howell's other interests include computing and the World Wide Web, and how technology affects communication, teaching, and research.\n\nBrief Contents\nPreface xi\nChapter 1 Introduction 1\nChapter 2 Basic Concepts 18\nChapter 3 Displaying Data 36\nChapter 4 Measures of Central Tendency 62\nChapter 5 Measures of Variability 78\nChapter 6 The Normal Distribution 107\nChapter 7 Basic Concepts of Probability 129\nChapter 8 Sampling Distributions and Hypothesis Testing 151\nChapter 9 Correlation 184\nChapter 10 Regression 225\nChapter 11 Multiple Regression 262\nChapter 12 Hypothesis Tests Applied to Means: One Sample 295\nChapter 13 Hypothesis Tests Applied to Means: Two Related Samples 327\nChapter 14 Hypothesis Tests Applied to Means: Two Independent Samples 344\nChapter 15 Power 372\nChapter 16 One-Way Analysis of Variance 396\nChapter 17 Factorial Analysis of Variance 440\nChapter 18 Repeated-Measures Analysis of Variance 470\nChapter 19 Chi-Square 488\nChapter 20 Nonparametric and Distribution-Free Statistical Tests 520\nChapter 21 Meta-Analysis 547\nAppendix A Arithmetic Review 566\nAppendix B Symbols and Notation 573\nAppendix C Basic Statistical Formulae 576\nAppendix D Data Set 580\nAppendix E Statistical Tables 584\nGlossary 602\nReferences 608\nAnswers to Exercises 615\nIndex 637","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80f145500f752a1e257f4e816943400816497d25","amp;dn":"Fundamental+Statistics+for+the+Behavioral+Sciences+%288th+Ed%29%28gnv6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80f145500f752a1e257f4e816943400816497d25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,241,69,80,15,117,42,30,37,127,78,129,105,67,64,8,22,73,125,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
