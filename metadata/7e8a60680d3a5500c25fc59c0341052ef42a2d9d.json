This course takes you through the steps of shooting both photography and video on green screen. Authors Rich Harrington and Abba Shapiro walk you through the process of preparing a live-action set, from hanging the backdrop to lighting the subject with strobes; positioning and posing your subject; and completing the scene with postproduction techniques in Adobe After Effects, Photoshop, and Premiere Pro.
