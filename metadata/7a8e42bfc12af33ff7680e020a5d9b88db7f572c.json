The answer is revealed in this fascinating programme, which explores the strange and surprising science of decay.\r\nFor two months in summer 2011, a glass box containing a typical kitchen and garden was left to rot in full public view within Edinburgh Zoo. In this resulting documentary, presenter Dr George McGavin and his team use time-lapse cameras and specialist photography to capture the extraordinary way in which moulds, microbes and insects are able to break down our everyday things and allow new life to emerge from old.\r\nDecay is something that many of us are repulsed by. But as the programme shows, it's a process that's vital in nature. And seen in close-up, it has an unexpected and sometimes mesmerising beauty.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b5/After-Life-The-Science-of-Decay-BBC-1080p-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6a/After-Life-The-Science-of-Decay-BBC-1080p-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/60/After-Life-The-Science-of-Decay-BBC-1080p-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3c/After-Life-The-Science-of-Decay-BBC-1080p-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b9/After-Life-The-Science-of-Decay-BBC-1080p-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4a/After-Life-The-Science-of-Decay-BBC-1080p-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/be/After-Life-The-Science-of-Decay-BBC-1080p-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/20/After-Life-The-Science-of-Decay-BBC-1080p-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6c/After-Life-The-Science-of-Decay-BBC-1080p-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x265/HEVC CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 23 (~2562Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1920x1080\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 1.68 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b012w66t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a8e42bfc12af33ff7680e020a5d9b88db7f572c","amp;dn":"BBC+After+Life+The+Strange+Science+of+Decay+1080p+x265+AAC+HDTV+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a8e42bfc12af33ff7680e020a5d9b88db7f572c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,142,66,191,193,42,243,63,247,104,14,2,10,93,155,136,219,127,87,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
