We also include for the first time ever the BTS video, explaining every light, shooting on green screen, and tethering your photo shoot.\n\nWe start out by showing you how to create a sketch that will eventually become your final image. Included are some amazing techniques for establishing perspective, and building in elements to match it. As you can see the entire image was created in a simple sketch before we even touch the images.\n\nNext we start bringing in each photo and fitting it to itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s given space. The great thing about using this method is that there is no guess work. You donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have to be an amazing artist or an art student to be able to follow these perspective rules. We show you how to make it plug-and-play. By the end of this tutorial you will have the confidence to create your own worlds.\n\nAfter we bring in each photo, they are colored and adjusted to fit the overall scene. We show you how to make light look like it is interacting with itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚â‚¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s environment, and how to create shadows. Then we bring in our athlete, cut him out from his background, and match him to the background.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e4691593c4fc4becf4eefaac74cbf951d12b84d","amp;dn":"Phlearn+-+The+Last+Athlete+-+sum1_here","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e4691593c4fc4becf4eefaac74cbf951d12b84d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,70,145,89,60,79,196,190,207,78,239,170,199,76,191,149,29,18,184,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
