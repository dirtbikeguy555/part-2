Along the way, the group was fleshed out by rhythm guitarist Blake Bunzel, bassist Jesse Landry, and drummer Jeff Fabb; embarked on several U.S. tours with the likes of Diecast and 36 Crazyfists; and gradually honed its melodic metalcore songwriting for the recording of the 2007 debut album Beautiful Tragedy, which was supported via the band's inclusion in the Hot Chicks of Metal Tour, featuring Lacuna Coil and Within Temptation, among others. \n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                 In This Moment - Beautiful Tragedy\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: In This Moment\nAlbum................: Beautiful Tragedy\nGenre................: Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2007\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.98\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\nTags.................: , ID3 v2.3\nInformation..........: \n\nRipped by............: grayghost on 12/30/2008\nPosted by............: grayghost on 12/30/2008\nNews Server..........: news.astraweb.com\nNews Group(s)........: alt.binaries.sounds.mp3.metal.full.albums\n\nIncluded.............: NFO\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.

But In This Moment decrease the metalcore and screamo elements considerably on their sophomore album, The Dream, which was produced by Kevin Churko and is decidedly more commercial and mainstream-sounding than its predecessor. Churko is hardly someone who has worked with underground bands exclusively; his pop-drenched rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sumÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© ranges from Ozzy Osbourne to Britney Spears, Ringo Starr, Lisa Marie Presley, Celine Dion, and Shania Twain. And under Churko's direction, In This Moment receive a stylistic makeover that is somewhere between the melancholy introspection of Evanescence and the 1980s arena rock grandiosity of Pat Benatar and Lita Ford. Occasionally, there are some metalcore and screamo moves on this 2008 release; Brink offers a clean vocals/extreme vocals contrast on &quot;The Great Divide,&quot; for example, and gets into some abrasive screaming on that track. But on the whole, The Dream isn't as heavy as Beautiful Tragedy; at least 95-percent of Brink's vocals are clean vocals this time, and most of the songs have little relevance to either metalcore or screamo. But while some fans of Beautiful Tragedy will no doubt cry &quot;sellout,&quot; the bottom line is that The Dream is a well-crafted, well-executed alternative rock/alternative metal effort. Churko definitely makes In This Moment more commercial and more accessible by mainstream standards, but he doesn't make the Los Angeles residents sound generic or mechanical. In fact, Brink's ability to bring to mind Evanescence's Amy Lee, Benatar and Ford all at once is a plus; that combination of influences is both attractive and intriguing. And even though some fans of metalcore and screamo will lament the band's pop-friendly makeover, that doesn't make The Dream any less excellent. Churko has clearly done right by In This Moment. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                     In This Moment - The Dream\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: In This Moment\nAlbum................: The Dream\nGenre................: Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2008\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.98\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\nTags.................: , ID3 v2.3\nInformation..........: \n\nRipped by............: grayghost on 12/30/2008\nPosted by............: grayghost on 12/30/2008\nNews Server..........: news.astraweb.com\nNews Group(s)........: alt.binaries.sounds.mp3.metal.full.albums\n\nIncluded.............: NFO\nCovers...............: Front Back \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
