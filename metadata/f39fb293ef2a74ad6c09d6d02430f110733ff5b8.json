But they were betrayedÃ¢â‚¬â€and the entire galaxy has paid the price. It is the Age of the Empire.\n \nNow Emperor Palpatine, once Chancellor of the Republic and secretly a Sith follower of the dark side of the Force, has brought his own peace and order to the galaxy. Peace through brutal repression, and order through increasing control of his subjectsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ lives.\n \nBut even as the Emperor tightens his iron grip, others have begun to question his means and motives. And still others, whose lives were destroyed by PalpatineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s machinations, lay scattered about the galaxy like unexploded bombs, waiting to go off. . . .\n \nThe first Star Wars novel created in collaboration with the Lucasfilm Story Group, Star Wars: A New Dawn is set during the legendary Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dark TimesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ between Episodes III and IV and tells the story of how two of the lead characters from the animated series Star Wars Rebels first came to cross paths. Featuring a foreword by Dave Filoni.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f39fb293ef2a74ad6c09d6d02430f110733ff5b8","amp;dn":"A+New+Dawn%3A+Star+Wars+by+John+Jackson+Miller","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f39fb293ef2a74ad6c09d6d02430f110733ff5b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,159,178,147,239,42,116,173,108,9,214,208,36,48,241,16,115,63,245,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
