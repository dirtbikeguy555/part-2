It was a runner-up for the Hugo award for Best All-Time Series (the winner was the Foundation series by Isaac Asimov).\n\nThe series begins with Triplanetary, set two billion years before the present time. The universe has few life-forms aside from the ancient Arisians, and few planets besides the Arisians' native world. The peaceful Arisians have foregone physical skills in order to develop contemplative mental power. The underlying assumption for this series, based on theories of stellar evolution extant at the time of the books' writing, is that planets form only rarely, and therefore our First and Second Galaxies, with their many billions of planets, are unique.\n\nThe series was published in magazines, before being collected and reworked into the better-known series of books. The complete series in internal sequence and their original publication dates are:\n\n\t01 - Triplanetary (1948)\n\t02 - First Lensman (1950)\n\t03 - Galactic Patrol (1950)\n\t04 - Gray Lensman (1951)\n\t05 - Second Stage Lensmen (1953)\n\t05.5 - 05.5 - The Vortex Blaster (1960) [also Known as Masters of the Vortex]\n\t06 - Children of the Lens (1954)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bddbcad04a64be493f86e28d17a9898afb81e23d","amp;dn":"E+E+%27Doc%27+Smith+-+Lensman+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bddbcad04a64be493f86e28d17a9898afb81e23d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,219,202,208,74,100,190,73,63,134,226,141,23,169,137,138,251,129,226,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
