The series shows how animals attempt to overcome the challenges that face them at each of the six crucial stages of life as they strive towards ultimate success.In the first episode, animals overcome their first great hurdle - surviving infancy.\n\nGrowing Up : Episode 2 of 6 &quot;Original air date 30 October 2014&quot;\n\nIn the journey towards adulthood, a moment comes for all animals when they must strike out on their own. With their parents absent they must learn to survive in a dangerous world. At this stage of life every small success may mean the difference between life and death.\n\nHome : Episode 3 of 6 &quot;Original air date 6 November 2014&quot;\n\nAnimals must find somewhere to live - a place that provides the necessities of life, shelter from the elements and a refuge from enemies.Good homes are rare and competition can be intense - finding a home is one thing, but defending it is quite another.\n\nPower : Episode 4 of 6 &quot;Original air date 13 November 2014&quot;\n\nAnimals must try to gain a position of power in their worlds. The most powerful have best access to food and water, and they are also the most attractive to the opposite sex.An orphaned, friendless, young chimp leaves his playful youth behind as he attempts to climb the social ladder. His troop is ruled by big, aggressive males. His first attempt to join them ends in a beating, but making his first friend changes his life. Together, they hunt for small mammals using spears, and share the spoils. It's an act that changes them from friends to allies.\n\nCourtship : Episode 5 of 6 &quot;Original air date 20 November 2014&quot;\n\nThe competition to breed has created both the most extraordinary beauty and the most violent battles seen in nature. Waved albatross pair for life and spend hours canoodling with each other. But for a male peacock jumping spider one wrong move in his dazzling courtship routine may well prove fatal.\n\nParenthood : Episode 6 of 6 &quot;Original air date 27 November 2014&quot;\n\nIn the final episode of Life Story, animals attempt to rear their offspring. This takes extraordinary commitment, and a parent may even need to risk its own life for its offspring. A female turtle, returning to the island where she was born 30 years ago, hauls herself up the beach to lay her eggs in a safe place above the tide line. But her commitment may prove her undoing. The low tide traps her on the island behind a wall of coral. If she cannot climb over it the heat of the sun will kill her.\n\ncast\n\nDavid Attenborough:...Himself - Presenter/Narrated (6 episodes, 2014)\nProduction company:...BBC Television/Discovery Channel/France Televisions\n\n\nVideo:-\n\nFormat :mkv/AVC\nWriting Library :x264 /&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;430b2a242b030f776d73&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nDuration :  58mn &gt; approximate\nBitrate : 4 221 Kbps\nResolution=Width/Height : 1920 x 1080 pixels\nFrame Rate : 25.000 fps\n\nAudio:-\n\nFormat :AC-3\nBitrate : 640 Kbps\nChannels :6 Channels\nChannel Positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSample Rate : 48KHz\nLanguage : English\n\nRelease info:-\n\nEncoded/Released By :tomcat12/ETRG\nTitle/Year : &quot;Life Story&quot; / 2014\nFile Size : 1.98 GiB / 2.00 GiB &gt; approximate\nGenre :  Documentary\nSource : 1080i Blu-ray - NTb[Thanks]\nChapters : Yes  \nSample : Yes\nSubtitles(VobSub): English\nIMDB :  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4150884/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4150884/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/and&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/anh&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/anh&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/anb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/anb&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/an3&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/an3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/an9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/an9&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/anM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://extraimago.com/image/anM&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nGreetz To: SaM |ozi|juggs|LRS|SureNdrA|Psix|Masta|MgB|3Li|FWOLF|Extratorrent|.\n\n\n\nMake sure it is Genuine ETRG release @or from our Trusted Accounts elswhere","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a549709d2a62b0434a3233d05e7a715327822af2","amp;dn":"B.B.C.Life.Story.S1.2014.1080p.BluRay.AC3.x264-tomcat12%5BETRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a549709d2a62b0434a3233d05e7a715327822af2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,73,112,157,42,98,176,67,74,50,51,208,94,122,113,83,39,130,42,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
