The game was developed by The Creative Assembly and released on September 22, 2004. It is the third game of The Creative Assembly's Total War series.\n\nAs Barbarian Invasion takes place 350 years after the end of the original game, factions and provinces are very different. Although the Roman Senate still exists it no longer has significant power, thus playing no role in the expansion. Rome has become an empire, grown and then split into a Western and an Eastern empire, ruled from Rome and Constantinople respectively; all Italy and the Mediterranean islands, Mauretania, Africa, Egypt, Syria and Palestine, Asia, Pontus, Greece, Thrace, Illyricum, Alpine countries, Spain, Gaul and most of Britain are now comprehended in the domain of imperial Rome. These subject regions represent the former factions of Egypt, Macedon, Pontus, the Greek city states, Carthage, Gaul, Iberia, the Britons and Numidians all of who have been absorbed into the Roman Empire. The Seleucid Empire has collapsed and has been absorbed by Rome and former Parthia; the Parthian dynasty itself has been overthrown and replaced with the Sassanid dynasty. Dacia has been conquered by the Goths, and Numidia has been entirely replaced by Berbers. The Huns have invaded Europe, and several major Germanic tribes have unified and strengthened to the point where they are now capable of invading the Empire itself.\n\nRome Total War: Alexander is the second expansion for the personal computer game Rome: Total War. It is set in an earlier time period, putting the player in the role of Alexander the Great. It begins with Alexander's ascension to the Macedonian throne in 336 B.C. and lasts for 100 turns, each of which, unlike the original game and the first expansion, Barbarian Invasion, do not represent six months (assuming that it follows Alexander's actual reign of thirteen years, each turn would represent nearly seven weeks). The game is much the same as the original Rome: Total War, but with fewer factions, different units, and a different map. The player's goal is to conquer 30 provinces, including key cities such as Tyre, Halicarnassus and Babylon, within the 100 turn limit.\nThe game allows Alexander to live longer than the 33 years of his actual life. He died in Babylon on the afternoon of June 10ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“11, 323 B.C., just one month short of turning 33.\n\n======== INFO ========\n\nYes, it includes expansions Barbarians and Alexander. \n1280x800, GmaX3100 works nice! \n\nPorted by request.
