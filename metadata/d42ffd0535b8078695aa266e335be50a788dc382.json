Found on http://librivox.org, a public domaim audiobook database of legal book narrations.  Source specifically from http://www.archive.org/download/walden_librivox/walden_librivox_64kb_mp3.zip, but tagged and edited by liguhy.  Source exactly same except for Librivox credit moved to each track end instead of beginning, and volume normalized.  Contains complete tags  including album art - tag titles broken up by chapter (two chapters have multiple tracks however).  Reading is just Walden itself and does not include any preludes, introductions, appendices, or annotations (like the cover art's actual book contains).\n\nAuthor:  Henry David Thoreau\nAlbum:  Album Walden\nGenre:  Audiobook\nNarrator:  Gordon McKenzie\nPublisher:  Librivox.org\nYear:  2006\nChannels:  2 (stereo)\nSample Rate: 44.1 KHz{CR}\nSample Size: 16 bit\nBit Rate: 256 kbps\nEncoder: LAME3.92U\nAudio Quality Very High  (Lossy)\nContains Album Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d42ffd0535b8078695aa266e335be50a788dc382","amp;dn":"Henry+David+Thoreau+-+Walden+Audiobook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d42ffd0535b8078695aa266e335be50a788dc382","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,47,253,5,53,184,7,134,149,170,38,110,51,91,229,10,120,141,195,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
