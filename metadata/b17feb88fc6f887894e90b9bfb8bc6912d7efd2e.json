As a science journalist covering the competition, Foer became captivated by the secrets of the competitors, like how the current world memory champion, Ben Pridmore, could memorize the exact order of 1,528 digits in an hour. He met with individuals whose memories are truly uniqueÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from one man whose memory only extends back to his most recent thought, to another who can memorize complex mathematical formulas without knowing any math. Brains remember visual imagery but have a harder time with other information, like lists, and so with the help of experts, Foer learned how to transform the kinds of memories he forgot into the kind his brain remembered naturally. The techniques he mastered made it easier to remember information, and Foer\\'s story demonstrates that the tricks of the masters are accessible to anyone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b17feb88fc6f887894e90b9bfb8bc6912d7efd2e","amp;dn":"Moonwalking+with+Einstein%3A+The+Art+and+Science+of+Remembering+Ev","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b17feb88fc6f887894e90b9bfb8bc6912d7efd2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,127,235,136,252,111,136,120,148,233,11,155,251,139,198,145,45,126,253,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
