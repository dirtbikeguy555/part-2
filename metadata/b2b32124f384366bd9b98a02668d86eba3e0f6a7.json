No one knows the identity of the baby, what ended her very short life, or how she came to be found among the fallen leaves. But for the residents of Ridgedale, there is no shortage of opinions.\n\nWhen freelance journalist and recent Ridgedale transplant Molly Sanderson is unexpectedly called upon to cover the disturbing news for the Ridgedale ReaderÃ¢â‚¬â€the town's local paperÃ¢â‚¬â€she has good reason to hesitate. A severe depression followed the loss of her own baby, and this assignment could unearth memories she has tried hard to bury. But the disturbing history Molly uncovers is not her own. Her investigation reveals a decades-old trail of dark secrets hiding behind Ridgedale's white picket fences.\n\nTold from the perspectives of three Ridgedale women, Kimberly McCreight's taut and profoundly moving novel unwinds the tangled truth behind the tragedy, revealing that these women have far more in common than they could ever have imagined: that the very worst crimes are committed against those we love. And thatÃ¢â‚¬â€sooner or laterÃ¢â‚¬â€the past catches up to all of us","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2b32124f384366bd9b98a02668d86eba3e0f6a7","amp;dn":"Where+They+Found+Her+-+Kimberly+McCreight","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2b32124f384366bd9b98a02668d86eba3e0f6a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,179,33,36,243,132,54,107,217,185,138,2,102,141,134,235,163,224,246,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
