Stine wrote the books then he started the show, well any who I've \nwent threw hell to get all the episodes but I got them all. Now 97% of the \nepisodes are in DVD quality(one or two actual DVDRips) but a few are VHS \nquality but that doesn't mean there unwatchable, there just not DVD quality. \nI loved this show growing up but it kind went sour around the end of season 3 \nbut maybe your kids or you may NjOY this show.\n\nWhen I was a kid I watched a lot of TV and I got a lot more shows I am looking \nfor, so when I get another TV set I am going to up it; mostly will be &quot;Are You \nAfraid of The Dark&quot;, &quot;Rugrats&quot;, or &quot;X-Men Series&quot;. Here are a three sample clips just \nto show everyone how the quality looks...\n\n-----------------\nDVDRip Quality\n-----------------\n\n-----------------\nSDTV Quality\n-----------------\n\n-----------------\nVHS Quality (VHS Quality Varies)\n-----------------\n\n\nThe full Goosebumps set is very hard to get because there's no full VHS or DVD \nset for this series just a few random episodes here and there, so grab this \nwhile you still can.\n\n&quot;Downloaders beware, your in for a scare&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20aa91c9fd638fb2341a8c1c10b7575f6f2be275","amp;dn":"Goosebumps+The+Complete+Series+READNFO+XviD+-+KaN1vE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20aa91c9fd638fb2341a8c1c10b7575f6f2be275","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,170,145,201,253,99,143,178,52,26,140,28,16,183,87,95,111,43,226,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
