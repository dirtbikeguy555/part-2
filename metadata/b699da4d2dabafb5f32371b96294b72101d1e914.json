But once you adjust to Sokurov's spare effects and measured cutting, the haunting, unforgettable images in Mother And Son leave no doubt as to why he's considered one of the world's premier film artists. The clean-lined, economical story concerns an anguished young man (the sad-eyed Alexi Ananishnov) so devoted to his dying mother (Gunrun Geyer) that he refuses to accept the inevitable. Isolated from the rest of society, save for the occasional train passing in the distance, he spends long days carrying her across the idyllic landscape outside their cottage, stalling frequently from the burden. There are times when the action stalls in turn, as Sokurov wipes away the already scant dialogue and movement and the film becomes more like an especially vibrant painting. Using special, hand-painted filters and distorting lenses that flatten the characters against their surroundings (and each other), Sokurov creates a hazy, muted visual texture that lends his melancholy story uncommon intimacy and power. Some have found this cinematic museum piece interminably dull, but for those willing to ride out its eccentricities, Mother And Son is a unique, rewarding experience.[/QUOTE] &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/ganeeaabf.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/ganeeaabf.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/ganehaabf.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/ganehaabf.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/ganejaabf.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/ganejaabf.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/ganeaaabf.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/ganeaaabf.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/faneoaabf.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/image/faneoaabf.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nripping notes:\nDGindex reported this as NTSC interlaced, but surely it was a transcode. However due to the nature of this film I was unable to find any sequence where I was able to confirm that when I made test rips, so I ended up doing what I thought was right, restoring to 25FPS. The quality factor is twice the previous rip.\n\nThe English subs could use a little attention if someone wants to take the time, but even with no subs at all this film would have the same impact...and if it you aren't moved by it, you have no soul.\n\n~~~~~~ Mat i syn.avi ~~~~~~                                    \n                                                             \nFile Size (in bytes):...........................942,331,904                    \n                                                                               \n--- Video Information ---                                                      \nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4              \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:08:28                \nFrame Count:....................................102696            \nFrame Width (pixels):...........................624                  \nFrame Height (pixels):..........................400                  \nAspect Ratio:...................................1.560                    \nFrames Per Second:..............................25.000          \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1633                \n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................                    \nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.262&quot;                    \n                                                                               \n--- Audio Information ---                                                      \nAudio Codec:....................................0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3                  \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000            \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................192                \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............CBR            \nAudio Channel Count:............................2\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
