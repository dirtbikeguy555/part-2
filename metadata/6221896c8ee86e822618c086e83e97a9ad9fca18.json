What do you see? You see extreme fatsos sucking down potato chips and diet sodas. You see extremely skinny, emaciated, low testosterone effeminate males. Maybe you even look like them. Maybe you used to look like them.\n\nIn todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world the only way to have naturally high testosterone is through diet and exercise. We arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t out all day chasing down our food and killing it with spears and bows and arrows. We are comfortable. We are complacent. Well, most people are. You, on the other hand, are Spartan. You are not comfortable being a fatass or a skinny goof.\n\nSo you go to the gym and you lift weights. You become strong. You become lean.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6221896c8ee86e822618c086e83e97a9ad9fca18","amp;dn":"Body-of-a-Spartan.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6221896c8ee86e822618c086e83e97a9ad9fca18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,33,137,108,142,232,110,130,38,24,192,134,232,62,151,169,173,159,202,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
