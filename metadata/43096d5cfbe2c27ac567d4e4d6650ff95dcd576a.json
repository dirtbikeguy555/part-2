Android has always been a \nnatural fit with Arduino projects, but now that Google has released the Android Open Accessory Development Kit (the Android ADK), combining Android \nwith Arduino to create custom gadgets has become even easier.\n\nBeginning Android ADK with Arduino shows how the ADK works and how it can be used with a variety of Arduino boards to create a variety of fun projects \nthat showcase the abilities of the ADK.\n\nMario Bohmer will walk you through several projects, including making sounds, driving motors, and creating alarm systems, all while explaining how to use \nthe ADK and how standard Arduino boards may differ from Google-branded Arduinos. You aren't tied to specific hardware with this book; use what you \nhave, and this book will show you how.\n\nWhat youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ How different boards work with the ADK \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ How to create your first sketch and project \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ How to work with light and sound \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ How to work with servos and DC motors \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ How to work with photoresistors and thermistors to sense the environment \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ How to make your own capacitive touch game show buzzer \nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ How to create your own camera-enabled alarm system \nWho this book is for\nThis book is for beginning Arduino and Android enthusiasts, or Arduino developers who want to try out the new Android ADK.\n\nPLZ SEED AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43096d5cfbe2c27ac567d4e4d6650ff95dcd576a","amp;dn":"Beginning+Android+ADK+with+Arduino%5BEPUB%2BPDF%5D%5BTeam+Nanban%5D%5BTPB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43096d5cfbe2c27ac567d4e4d6650ff95dcd576a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,9,109,92,251,226,194,122,197,103,212,228,214,101,15,249,93,205,87,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
