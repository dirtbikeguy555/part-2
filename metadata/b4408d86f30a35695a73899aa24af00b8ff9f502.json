Now, human excellence can be systematically studied, then reproduced. Just as you can learn to ski, drive, or use a computer, so too can you learn to apply the core achievement skills: motivation, persuasion, confidence and self-esteem.\n\nIn these tapes, some of the nationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s outstanding NLP trainers will share the same strategies they have taught thousands of NLP Comprehensive seminar participants. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn:\n\n    * How your motivation strategy works and how to use it at will\n    * How to eliminate past limitations and gain confidence in your future\n    * How to set your goals and future mission\n    * How to apply specific processes to gain deep self-appreciation and self-esteem\n\n\nBecause NLP processes are universal, you can apply them to every area of your life. Our trainers will guide you in applying the processes so you can attain a lasting positive outlook and increase your peak performances.\n\nEnjoy the path you have selectedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the NLP pathÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to the rewards of greater personal achievement.\n\nDeveloped in the early 1970s by Richard Bandler and John Grinder, in association with Gregory Bateson, neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) is a personal development system . It uses a toolbox of strategies, axioms and beliefs about human perception and subjective experience.\n\nFeaturing: Charles Faulkner\n\n    * Gerry Schmidt, Ph.D.\n    * Dr. Robert McDonald\n    * Tim Hallbom, M.S.W.\n    * Suzi Smith, M.D.\n    * Kelly Gerling, Ph.D.\n\n\nVisit http://prince213.blogspot.com/ for more...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4408d86f30a35695a73899aa24af00b8ff9f502","amp;dn":"NLP+-+The+New+Technology+of+Achievement","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4408d86f30a35695a73899aa24af00b8ff9f502","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,64,141,134,243,10,53,105,90,115,137,154,162,74,240,11,143,249,245,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
