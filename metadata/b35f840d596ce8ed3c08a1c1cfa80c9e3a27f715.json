He was poised to challenge the newly elected U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower with armed force, and was also broadening a vicious campaign against Soviet Jews. Stalinâ€™s sudden collapse and death in March 1953 was as dramatic and mysterious as his life. It is no overstatement to say that his passing marked a major turning point in the twentieth century.\r\n \r\nThe Last Days of Stalin is an engaging, briskly told account of the dictatorâ€™s final active months, the vigil at his deathbed, and the unfolding of Soviet and international events in the months after his death. Rubenstein throws fresh light on:\r\n- the devious plotting of Beria, Malenkov, Khrushchev, and other â€œcomrades in armsâ€ who well understood the significance of the dictatorâ€™s impending death;\r\n- the witness-documented events of his death as compared to official published versions;\r\n- Stalinâ€™s rumored plans to forcibly exile Soviet Jews;\r\n- the responses of Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dulles to the Kremlinâ€™s conciliatory gestures after Stalinâ€™s death; and\r\n- the momentous repercussions when Stalinâ€™s regime of terror was cut short","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b35f840d596ce8ed3c08a1c1cfa80c9e3a27f715","amp;dn":"The+Last+Days+of+Stalin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b35f840d596ce8ed3c08a1c1cfa80c9e3a27f715","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,95,132,13,89,108,232,237,60,8,161,193,207,168,12,158,58,39,247,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
