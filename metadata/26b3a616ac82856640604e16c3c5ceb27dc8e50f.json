An architectural photograph shows the form and appeal of a building far better than any other medium. With the advent of the digital photographic workflow, architects, real estate firms, and interior designers are discovering exciting new opportunities to present and market their work.But what are the ingredients for a successful architectural photograph? What equipment do you need? How can you improve your images in the digital darkroom? Why does a building look different in reality than it does in a photograph?
