Your search starts and ends with VacationerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s latest release Relief. The R&amp;B tinged pop sophomore effort by the group is an diverse mix of tunes, making one of the most refreshing and unique album releases in a while.\n\nHearing vocalist Kenny Vasoli (formerly of The Starting Line) telling listeners that Ã¢â‚¬Å“thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a paradise waiting for us in summertime,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ on the catchy tune Ã¢â‚¬Å“Paradise Waiting,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ leaves little doubt that the release date perfectly lining up with the start of summer was no coincidence. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ParallelsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ starts out with a jazzy introduction, featuring horns and flutes, making one feel as if they are back in the 1940s listening to a Count Basie record. However, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Onward &amp; UpwardÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“HeavenlyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ almost sound like they could be the poppy B-sides to a Fleet Foxes album. So when you are picking tunes for your summer party playlists, you are definitely going to want to include Vacationer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1584c7d4f3fa2a02cb4dff6803f1b7e0b49ed897","amp;dn":"Vacationer+-+Relief+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1584c7d4f3fa2a02cb4dff6803f1b7e0b49ed897","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,132,199,212,243,250,42,2,203,77,255,104,3,241,183,224,180,158,216,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
