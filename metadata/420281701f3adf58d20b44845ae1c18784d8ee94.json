It includes most\r\nof their singles, as well as three new songs, &quot;Not the Girl You Think You Are&quot;,\r\n&quot;Instinct&quot;, and &quot;Everything Is Good for You&quot;.\r\n\r\nCrowded House were touring in support of their album Together Alone, when after a concert\r\nin Atlanta on 14 April 1994, drummer Paul Hester decided to leave the band. He was eventually\r\nreplaced by Peter Jones. The band completed the tour and returned to Australia where bandleader\r\nNeil Finn began writing songs for their next album, provisionally titled Help Is Coming. During\r\nthis time he also wrote and recorded the album Finn with his brother Tim Finn. At a press\r\nconference in 1996, at which the release of Recurring Dream was announced, Neil Finn revealed\r\nthat Crowded House were to split up.
