The album, titled This Was Tomorrow, is a ground breaking and utterly relatable hip-hop masterpiece. \n\nFrom the incredible success of The Waitress Song (2009), to the current radio smash singles &quot;My Scene&quot; and &quot;Float Away&quot;, This Was Tomorrow is indicative of the exponential rate at which Australian hip-hop is evolving. Bold, atmospheric and almost orchestral; it is a grand and ambitious gesture from a humble and entirely creative artist. \nNot content with cashing in and selling out, Seth Sentry has laid the foundations for his future by setting up his own record label, High Score Records, with independent distribution through Inertia. \nThis Was Tomorrow will be the label's first release. \n\nThe album comes down to how big a music fan Seth Sentry is. Within the context of hip-hop, he is both a student and a master... a protege. An aficionado who wanted to be a part of the world of music he could lose himself in as a listener. And even though it is still early in the game, Seth Sentry's contributions to this world are already nothing short of outstanding.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01 - Campfire\n02 - My Scene\n03 - Ink Blot Test\n04 - Dear Science\n05 - Langolier's Banquet\n06 - Ten Paces\n07 - Float Away\n08 - Room For Rent\n09 - Thanks For Your Hospitality\n10 - Where Was You (When The Dead Come Walkin')?\n11 - Vacation\n\nRipped @ highest quality VBR\n\nAwesome album guys so remember if you like his music support the artist and buy the album","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7ed77cedef7f5ac94ff68c727ff7d2ca7447d9a","amp;dn":"Seth+Sentry+-+This+Was+Tomorrow+%282012%29-stevez","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7ed77cedef7f5ac94ff68c727ff7d2ca7447d9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,237,119,206,222,247,245,172,148,255,104,199,39,255,125,44,167,68,125,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
