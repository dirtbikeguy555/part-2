It can refer to an entertaining product that delights while educating, like Lego sets and electronics kits. It can be an apparatus like a plastic injection-molding machine that helps us produce figurines and widgets. Or it can be a new creation that we produce either for ourselves or as a part of a larger business for others to enjoy. In the latest issue of Make: weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll help you find the best maker toys, show you how to build toy-making tools, and learn from the pros on how to take your toy and game ideas to market.\n\n\tPlus, build a messenger bag that charges your electronic devices without the hassle of wires, 3D-print a fully functional pinhole camera, and inject powerful flavors into your favorite foods with nitrogen cavitation. Then, read about how 3D printing is being used in schools, ways to hack your brain waves to control your stuff, how one maker took his giant giraffe robot to visit the White House, and much more","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e79510c8b582b73fb4cb1a25b6d767991ff3b19","amp;dn":"MAKE+Magazine+-+Vol+41+-+Tinkering+Toys","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e79510c8b582b73fb4cb1a25b6d767991ff3b19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,121,81,12,139,88,43,115,251,76,177,162,91,109,118,121,145,255,59,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
