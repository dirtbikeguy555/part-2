This practical and accessible guide will show you more than just building handy and useful electronic security projects.\n\nBeginning with what the hams call &quot;DC to Daylight,&quot; you will learn how to build everything from an IR Beacon to an RF power meter and a ZigBee point-to-point network. All you need to get started is a few simple tools and ordinary soldering skills.\n\nThe projects eventually become more complex when you start building an infrared flashlight using materials from a dollar store. Here you start with a IR flashing beacon and a motion sensitive alarm with a really cool on/off switch, then you move on to a black box project that will turn your sound card into an oscilloscope and eventually a ZigBee-based alarm system","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47eeeb2bec2c639bb8e2ff862aac4813814f8666","amp;dn":"Getting+Started+With+Electronic+Projects+-+Bill+Pretty","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47eeeb2bec2c639bb8e2ff862aac4813814f8666","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,238,235,43,236,44,99,155,184,226,255,134,42,172,72,19,129,79,134,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
