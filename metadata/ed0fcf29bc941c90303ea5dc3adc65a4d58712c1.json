Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner is both metaphor and framework of the despair and hopelessness that some babies and parents experience in their efforts to hold on and go through difficult circumstances. Their early experiences are not voyages 'into a sunny and cheerful sea': some are years-long voyages into horror and weariness - babies born into difficult families, into countries in difficulties or into difficult circumstances.\r\n\r\nSome babies born into difficulties are pretty much alone because their mothers might be too ill to look after them, and nurses are too busy to fulfil the maternal function other than changing and feeding them. They may have been born in war zones, or in prisons, or have been in intensive neonatal premature units. Unlike mothers who recall the early years with their babies as a dance of understanding and development, other carers don't recall hearing the music at all. They slog through the early years with only hope as a compass. Like the Ancient Mariner looking for a sail on the horizon, theirs is a poignant search of the horizons for hope in any form.\r\n\r\nDifferent professionals, each expert in their field, address the different difficulties. They show us the connections between traumatic experiences and traumatic consequences of survival, the implications in both the families and in the professionals who, in constant contact and working together, deal with the containment and transformations of those events. This book brings us face-to-face with the wonderful capacities of the newborn and the great potential for parents (both mother and father) and child to continue growing together in a society that cares for them","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed0fcf29bc941c90303ea5dc3adc65a4d58712c1","amp;dn":"Surviving+the+Early+Years+%282016%29+%28Pdf%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed0fcf29bc941c90303ea5dc3adc65a4d58712c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,15,207,41,188,148,28,144,48,62,165,220,58,220,101,164,213,135,18,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
