He is perhaps best known as the drummer and founder of the influential Californian stoner rock band Kyuss. Bjork currently played in Vista Chino, along with former Kyuss vocalist John Garcia. Until October 2014 when Nick Oliveri announced that there was a falling out and that Bjork and Garcia would continue working on their solo projects.  He is one of the more notable figures in the stoner rock and Palm Desert scenes.\n\nWhile still in high school, Bjork got together with friends Josh Homme and John Garcia in 1987 to form a band called Katzenjammer. At Bjork's prompting, the band would soon be renamed Sons of Kyuss for a single EP, named after &quot;The Sons of Kyuss&quot; monsters in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing game, and then later shortened to Kyuss. The band relocated to Los Angeles in 1990 and signed to Chameleon Records, releasing their debut album, Wretch in September 1991. They were then picked up by the major label Elektra Records, becoming the first desert rock band to achieve international success. Bjork was a major creative force in Kyuss, contributing a substantial portion of the band's songwriting. In 1994, Bjork left the band following the release of Welcome to Sky Valley, frustrated at guitarist Homme's growing reluctance to play the songs he was contributing to the band.\n\nAfter leaving Kyuss, Bjork would go on to play with several different bands, as well as founding the independent label El Camino Records (later Duna Records). Through his label, Bjork would release albums that he was musically involved in, such as hardcore punk band De-Con's 1995 album Balls for Days, on which he played drums. Bjork would also release and produce stoner rock band Solarfeast's 1995 debut Gossamer. Bjork would later go on to join former Kyuss bandmate, Josh Homme, in his Palm Desert musical collective series, The Desert Sessions. He would play a mixture of guitar, bass, drums, and percussion on various tracks on the 1997 releases Volume 1: Instrumental Driving Music For Felons and Volume 2: Status: Ships Commander Butchered, as well as 1999's Volume 5: Poetry for the Masses (SeaShedShitheadByTheSheSore) and Volume 6: Black Anvil Ego.\n\nBjork briefly moved to Santa Cruz to play guitar for hardcore punk band LAB in 1997 (made up of the remaining members of 80's punk band BL'AST!), playing on their 1997 release, the 7&quot; EP &quot;Burning Leaf/Chihuahua&quot;. He would also play guitar for Fatso Jetson during 1997-1998, including on their 1998 &quot;Jailbreak&quot; 7&quot; split EP with stoner rock band Fu Manchu.\n\nBjork was playing with another former member of Kyuss, Nick Oliveri, in Oliveri's metal band Mondo Generator. Joining in 1997, Bjork's drumming would feature on the 2000 LP Cocaine Rodeo, and the 2003 LP A Drug Problem That Never Existed. He would tour with the band until leaving in 2004. Bjork also appeared on the live DVD, 2004's Use Once and Destroy Me, as well as later releases featuring the Bjork-era line-up, in including the 2006 7&quot; single &quot;I Never Sleep&quot; and the 2008 Australian Tour EP.\n\nHaving produced their debut album No One Rides for Free in 1994, Bjork would officially join Fu Manchu with the release of their critically acclaimed 1997 album The Action Is Go. Bjork would continue to play on every Fu Manchu recording until his departure following the release of 2001's California Crossing, including the LPs Eatin' Dust and King of the Road.\n\nBjork began recording his first solo album, 1999's Jalamanta, in February of that year. Bjork performed all instruments, including guitar and vocals. He would also perform guitar and vocals in the short-lived stoner rock band ChÃƒÂ© - a side-project collaboration with former Kyuss and Queens of the Stone Age drummer Alfredo HernÃƒÂ¡ndez. ChÃƒÂ© released their only album, Sounds of Liberation, in October 2000. Bjork's next album, 2002's Brant Bjork &amp; the Operators, named for Bjork's fictional backing band, 'the Operators', was recorded in November 2000 with Bjork again performing vocals and most instruments. He would continue to be the sole performer, except for a few guest spots, on 2003's Keep Your Cool and 2004's Local Angel.\n\nBjork would form the band Brant Bjork and the Bros in 2003, featuring guitarist Mike Pygmie, bassist Dylan Roche, and drummer Michael Peffer, with Bjork performing vocals and additional guitar. They toured Europe in October 2003, performing a mixture of Bjork's solo material and ChÃƒÂ©'s Sounds of Liberation. Pygmie was replaced by Scott Cortez Silverman for further touring in Europe and North America in 2004. This line-up went on to record the 2005 double album Saved by Magic. The album featured a return to the sound of Bjork's earlier sound from his Jalamanta/Sounds of Liberation era.\n\n2006 saw the release of Sabbia, a feature film &quot;visual soundtrack&quot; by filmmaker Kate McCabe, featuring Bjork's music. Brant Bjork and the Bros would go on to record another album, 2007's Somera SÃƒÂ³l, with Alfredo HernÃƒÂ¡ndez replacing Michael Peffer on drums. In the same year, Bjork released his fifth solo album, Tres Dias, an acoustic album featuring reinterpretations of older songs, as well as some new material. The title of the album (Three Days) comes from the purported amount of time that Bjork claimed it took to record it at producer Tony Mason's house in Joshua Tree, California.\n\nBjork reported in 2007 that he had ended his label, Duna Records, citing that it took too much time and energy to run. Bjork soon created a new label, Low Desert Punk Recordings, and the Duna Records website now functions as a Brant Bjork community fansite and forum. The first release on the new label was Bjork's 2008 album, Punk Rock Guilt, made up of recordings from December 2005 referred to as the &quot;New Jersey Sessions&quot;. This release was followed up with the 2010 album Gods &amp; Goddesses. Recorded in LA in 2009, Gods &amp; Goddesses was the first Brant Bjork solo album not to be primarily recorded by Bjork himself. Instead, Bjork recorded with a new line-up of musicians including guitarist Brandon Henderson, former Yawning Man bassist Billy Cordell, and former Mondo Generator drummer Giampaolo Farnedi.\n\nA new solo record entitled Jacuzzi has been recorded and mixed. Jacuzzi will be an instrumental album, featuring jazz and funk influences with break beats. Originally planned for release in 2013, it has been delayed for undisclosed reasons. A new release date is yet to be announced.\n\nIn March 2014, Bjork announced that he would tour Australia in May with his backing band, the 'Low Desert Punks', consisting of bassist Dave Dinsmore, guitarist Bubba Dupree, and Tony Tornay on drums. He would later announce a New Zealand tour with dates in June.\n\nIn November 2010, it was announced that Bjork was forming Kyuss Lives! with Bruno Fevery on guitar, Nick Oliveri on bass and John Garcia on vocals. The band undertook a European, Australian and New Zealand tour from March to May 2011. On November 2012, Kyuss Lives! announced that they had changed their name to Vista Chino.\n\nVista Chino released their debut album Peace on September 3, 2013 through Napalm Records.\n\n\n\nBand Members\n\nBrant Bjork Vocals\nDave Dinsmore Bass\nBubba Dupree Guitars\nTony Tornay Drums\n\n\n\nBlack Power Flower (2014)\n\n\n\n01 Controllers Destroyed\n02 We Don't Serve Their Kind\n03 Stokely up Now\n04 Buddha Time (Everything Fine)\n05 Soldier of Love\n06 Boogie Woogie on Your Brain\n07 Ain't No Runnin'\n08 That's a Fact, Jack\n09 Hustler's Blues\n10 Where You from, Man\nGenre:\tStoner\nSubgenre:\tStoner Rock\nBitrate:\t320 k\nSize:\t112.98 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n10 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b010c2ac556cde8675368072e0870888e964fbd5","amp;dn":"Brant+Bjork+The+Low+Desert+Punk+Band+-+Black+Power+Flower+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b010c2ac556cde8675368072e0870888e964fbd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,16,194,172,85,108,222,134,117,54,128,114,224,135,8,136,233,100,251,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
