Due to their free will, some Reploids are prone to criminal activity and are said to go &quot;Maverick&quot;. Dr. Cain, the inventor of the Reploids, establishes a military taskforce called the &quot;Maverick Hunters&quot; to prevent it. Even after two successful efforts by the Hunters Mega Man X and Zero to stop a Maverick leader named Sigma from attempting to exterminate the human race, Maverick activity seems to continue. However, the threat of the Mavericks is later neutralized thanks to the technology of the Reploid scientist Dr. Doppler, which prevents the Mavericks from going berserk. The reformed Reploids form a utopia near their new mentor called &quot;Doppler Town&quot;. It seemed that all is well until the former Reploids suddenly revert and once again begin causing trouble, even going so far as to attack Hunter headquarters. Doppler is held accountable, and X and Zero are sent out to contain the new threat.\nOnce the two heroes defeat Doppler and the forces that have sworn allegiance to him, the scientist comes to his senses and realizes all the damage that he has done. He explains that Sigma is alive, that his true form is now a computer virus, and that Doppler was corrupted in order to create a new body for Sigma. X seeks out Sigma, and after an intense battle, the Sigma Virus in its pure form chases X in an attempt to infect and possess him. Once X finds himself at a deadend, one of two things may happen. In the game's main ending, Zero takes Doppler's true antivirus software and uploads it onto his sabre offscreen. He rushes in to save X just in time and causes Sigma to explode, destroying the lab as they evacuate. However, if Zero is injured during the game, Doppler instead uses his own body as the antivirus and sacrifices himself for the greater good.\n----------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------\n\nMEGA MAN X 4:\n\nPLOT:\nThe plot for Mega Man X4 is presented by both fully-animated full motion video (FMV) cutscenes and in-game text. The storyline differs slightly depending on whether the player chooses Mega Man X or Zero. Taking place in an ambiguous year in the 22nd century (21XX) and following the third defeat of the &quot;Maverick&quot; robot Sigma, Cain Labs issues an initiative to create a supplementary military force to complement the &quot;Maverick Hunters&quot;. The army, called the &quot;Repliforce&quot;, is a strict regime led by General and his second-in-command, Colonel. Six months following the inception of the group, Cain Labs finds its methods to be ineffective, questionable, and potentially dangerous in the Maverick defense. To make matters worse, behind the scenes, General has been meeting with a mysterious figure who plots the Hunters' demise, insinuating that they are a significant threat to the jurisdiction of the Maverick Hunters. Mayhem breaks out when the Sky Lagoon, a massive floating city, is sent crashing down onto the city below it, killing millions of civilians, humans and Reploids alike. The game begins here where either X or Zero is dispatched to investigate possible causes of the disaster only to become entangled, once again, in a struggle against Sigma to save the world.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe gameplay in Mega Man X4 is similar to the previous installments of the Mega Man X series. The player is presented with a series of action-platforming stages that can be cleared in any order desired. In these stages, the player must avoid obstacles like falling debris and spikes, and destroy enemy robots to reach the end of the stages. The player character retains the capabilities from previous entries in the Mega Man X series like dashing and scaling walls. Some levels contain ridable vehicles such as hover bikes and armored-mecha. Each of the eight initial stages contains one Maverick boss, and defeating this boss gives the player a new ability. Every boss is weak to a particular ability, adding an element of strategy to the order in which the player completes the stages.\nAt the beginning of Mega Man X4, the player chooses to play through the game either as X or Zero. The two characters cannot be switched. Though both of them go through the same stages, they operate differently and are challenged differently from the terrain. X wields the &quot;X-Buster&quot;, a plasma cannon on his arm that he uses to attack foes from a distance. It can be charged to fire stronger shots. A new weapon is given to the player with each boss defeated while playing as X. These weapons have limited ammunition, displayed by a meter next to one's health, both of which can be refilled by picking up power-ups dropped by destroyed enemies. In some stages, the player can find hidden capsules that contain armor upgrades that greatly enhance X's capabilities. Zero is more melee-oriented than X by using a &quot;Z-Saber&quot; sword. The Z-Saber's power and accuracy compensate for its lack of range. Rather than acquiring weapons from bosses, Zero learns special techniques such as the &quot;Hienkyaku&quot; air-dash and &quot;Kuuenbu&quot; double-jump. However, Zero cannot upgrade any of his body parts in this game.\nThe player character's maximum health can be extended by obtaining a &quot;Heart Tank&quot; in each of the eight stages. Two &quot;Sub Tanks&quot; can also be found, which can be filled with life energy and then be used to replenish the player's health at any time. Two new Tanks have been added: a &quot;Weapon Tank (W-Tank)&quot;, which will fill up all of X's special weapons; and an &quot;EX Tank&quot;, which increases the character's default lives from two to four whenever the player continues from a save point.\n--------------------------------\n--------------------------------\n--------------------------------\n\nMEGA MAN X 5:\n\nSTORY:\nSigma, who has been revived again (as in X4, it is unknown who revived him or how), conducts research on the origin and design of Zero and decides to discover how to unlock Zero's true power, hopefully destroying X in the process. Sigma attacks the Maverick Hunters directly, intending to lose. When he does, he spreads the Maverick virus across the Earth, throwing it into chaos. Meanwhile, a Reploid mercenary named Dynamo is hired by Sigma to make the space colony Eurasia collide with Earth. The Hunters have only 16 hours to stop the collision.\nIn order to prevent Eurasia from striking the planet, the Hunters pursue two options. The first option is to fire a powerful cannon called Enigma at Eurasia, vaporizing it. If the Enigma shot fails, the second option is to launch a space shuttle and pilot it into the colony, destroying it. To maximize their chances, X and Zero are dispatched to collect parts for the two devices. The necessary parts to upgrade the Enigma and shuttle are held by eight Reploids and Mavericks), and X and Zero must defeat them to claim the parts.\nWhether the Enigma and shuttle succeed or fail is randomly determined by the game, although the Enigma's chances of working successfully are low even with all its parts, while the shuttle has a much higher probability of succeeding assuming all of the parts are collected. Whether the Enigma succeeds or fails, a &quot;new&quot; virus appears on the Earth, noted by Alia as the Sigma virus combining with the scraps from the colony. If the Enigma or the shuttle succeeds, X and Zero proceed to hunt for the cause of the virus. If the shuttle fails or if the time expires, the colony crashes, nearly destroying the planet; Zero then is infected by the virus and goes Maverick.\nIn either case, once the location of the virus' origin is discovered, the Hunters investigate. X and Zero penetrate a bizarre underground fortress. In the fortress, X and Zero cross paths, where mutual suspicion and mistrust leads to a duel between the heroes (which had been foreshadowed since the end of Mega Man X3).\nAfter the duel, the story diverges slightly. If Zero went Maverick, he sacrifices himself to save X from Sigma, and X continues on alone to defeat Sigma. If Zero did not go Maverick, he saves X and himself from Sigma, and both have a chance to confront Sigma.\nThere are three possible endings. If Zero went Maverick, X defeats Sigma, but is badly damaged. A mysterious figure recovers him, but also deletes all his memories of Zero. X is seen, three years later, talking to two other hunters, while Douglas, Alia, and Signas discuss the fact that X's memory of Zero has been deleted. This ending is treated as non-canon by Capcom, as there are further games where X and Zero work together.\nIf Zero did not go Maverick, Sigma decides to make the Hunters' victory for naught by taking them down with him. X tries to save Zero but is ambushed by Sigma and both Hunters are critically damaged. Zero manages to finish Sigma off, then the endings diverge again. If Zero defeated Sigma, he reflects on his origin and life before dying. If X defeated Sigma, he inherits Zero's beam saber and continues to fight as a Maverick Hunter. This is considered the &quot;true&quot; ending.\nIn each of X's endings, the mysterious figure is shown to be a hologram of Dr. Light, who discovers X's badly damaged body after the battle with Sigma and repairs X, saying &quot;Not yet... Actually, I want you to rest and relax for now. Hold on X... Just for a few more moments.&quot;\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nX5 was developed by a different team than X4, and this is evident in the style of gameplay. The most prominent difference in this iteration is the time limit of 16 hours (though at points the game or manual claim 24 hours), until the space station Eurasia crashes into Earth. Every time the player enters a stage, one hour is expended. At any point between levels, the player has the option of firing the Enigma at the Eurasia. If the Enigma misses, then the player has the option of launching the shuttle. Whether the crash is prevented or not is determined by random chance. If the crash is not prevented, the course of the story is changed. Due to the nature of the storyline, there are multiple endings. Whether X or Zero is used to defeat the last boss also affects which ending is seen.\nThe main gameplay remains the same. There are four armors for XÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½his Ultimate Armor, the upgraded armor from Mega Man X4, and two others that must be assembled from capsules. However, X cannot wear parts of these armors separately. X can also no longer shoot his buster through walls, and each character has the ability to duck. Zero is able to find and use the capsules. However, if Zero reaches the capsule that contains X's Ultimate Armor, Dr Light will offer the &quot;Black Zero&quot; Armor instead of the Ultimate Armor.\n----------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------\n\nMEGA MAN X 6:\n\nSTORY:\nThe story begins three weeks after Mega Man X5, with Zero missing, presumed dead, and the Earth's surface rendered uninhabitable. Rumors are spreading through the Reploid World of a Maverick named the Zero Nightmare, a Reploid of pure evil that is spreading chaos throughout the world. X, curious about this Maverick, and angered by its use of his late friendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s name, seeks him out.\nAfter destroying the Zero Nightmare, X learns that Zero is alive, just recovering from damage sustained in the last game. When Zero is recovered, he joins X and they seek out the researchers who built the Zero Nightmare.\nX finds the lead researcher, Gate, in his lab. After X defeats Gate in battle, Gate reveals that he has rebuilt Sigma, the leader of the Mavericks, but due to the timing of X's arrival Sigma isn't fully rebuilt. Sigma kills Gate,[citation needed] then challenges X to a duel. X is able to defeat the nearly rebuilt Sigma.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe gameplay is very similar to Mega Man X5. The player can select X with the option to outfit him with different armors offering unique abilities (most of which have to be downloaded, as always, through Dr. Light's hidden capsules.) Zero can be unlocked after finding and defeating the Zero Nightmare, bringing his own weapons and techniques to the fold, including a refined Z-Saber fighting style. Both characters can be equipped with various power-up items earned after rescuing a reploid.\nMega Man X6 has an increased emphasis on rescuing reploids over previous titles in the series. Whereas previous games rewarded the player with health or an extra life, Mega Man X6 rewards the player with additional parts or other permanent prizes. Rescuing reploids was made more difficult in this game with the addition of the Nightmare, which makes any reploid it infects evil, thus rendering the reploid impossible to save. The parts system was altered as well. Rather than attach a certain part to a certain armor, parts are attached to the character itself. The number of parts that can be equipped at once is dependent on the player's rank.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHELP ME SEED MY LOW-SEEDED TORRENTS SO I CAN UPLOAD MORE AND NOT WORRY ABOUT THE OLD ONES!\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDon't forget to snag a copy of my Land of the Dead torrent (you can play it online).\n\n\nI HAVE A FEW ONLINE PLAYABLE TORRENTS SO FAR:\nLand of the Dead\nPostal 1 and Postal 2 Share The Pain (All Mods)\nSniper Elite\nSerious Sam: The First and Second Encounter\nNexuiz\nDoom Collection (all the older doom games)  NOTE: This Requires a mod to play online (skulltag), it's free, google it\nOTHERS CAN MOST LIKELY BE PLAYED VIA HAMACHI\n\n\nDOWNLOAD ALL MY TORRENTS HERE:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/FuCtUpPuNk&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f95da757683a95bbb4b2d28799f35279504cf1d","amp;dn":"Mega+Man+X+3-6+%28Full+PSX+Collection%29+%28PS1%29+%28Megaman%29+%28ePSXe%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f95da757683a95bbb4b2d28799f35279504cf1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,149,218,117,118,131,169,91,187,75,45,40,121,159,53,39,149,4,207,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
