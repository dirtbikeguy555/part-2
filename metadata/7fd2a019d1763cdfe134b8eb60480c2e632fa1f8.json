The film was directed by Jack Gold and shot in Avala, Yugoslavia (now Serbia).\n\nOn October 14, 1943, members of the camp's underground resistance succeeded in covertly killing eleven German officers and a number of Ukrainian guards. Of the 600 inmates in the camp, roughly 300 escaped, although most were later re-captured and killed. The escape forced the Nazis to close the death camp. They dismantled it, bulldozed the earth, and planted trees to cover it up.\n\nThe screenplay was based on the book of the same name written by the American author, Richard Rashke.[2] Alan Arkin, Joanna PacuÃ…â€ša and Rutger Hauer were the primary stars of the film. Hauer received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Television). Thomas Blatt, a camp survivor who had assisted Rashke with his book, served as a technical consultant.\n\nIn credits order.\n\nAlan Arkin as Leon Feldhendler\nJoanna PacuÃ…â€ša as Luka\nRutger Hauer as Lieutenant Aleksandr 'Sasha' Pechersky\nHartmut Becker as SS-HauptscharfÃƒÂ¼hrer Gustav Wagner[note 1]\nJack Shepherd as Itzhak Lichtman\nEmil Wolk as Samuel\nSimon Gregor as Stanislaw 'Shlomo' Szmajzner\nLinal Haft as Kapo Porchek\nJason Norman as Thomas 'Toivi' Blatt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fd2a019d1763cdfe134b8eb60480c2e632fa1f8","amp;dn":"Escape+From+Sobibor+%281987%29+Rutger+Hauer%2C+Alan+Arkin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fd2a019d1763cdfe134b8eb60480c2e632fa1f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,210,160,25,209,118,60,223,225,52,184,235,96,72,12,46,99,47,161,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
