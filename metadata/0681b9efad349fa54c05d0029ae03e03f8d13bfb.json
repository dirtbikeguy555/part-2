Codes for Homeowners uses clear photographs to show exactly how the parts of your house are supposed to look once the work is done. Written by International Residential Codes-certified home inspector Bruce Barker, this second edition of Codes for Homeowners is current with most national codes in force for the period of 2012 through 2014. Based on his decades of experience, Inspector Bruce has winnowed down the massive heap of codes in force to only those that a single-family homeowner is likely to encounter. Building codes, electrical codes, plumbing codes and mechanical (HVAC) codes are shown and described in everyday language. The 2nd edition includes all of the great information in the first version but is updated to reflect any changes in the codes in force, including the National Electrical Code, the Universal Plumbing Code and the International Residential Code.\n\n\n2.............................\n\n\nBlack &amp; Decker The Complete Guide to Room Additions: Designing &amp; Building *Garage Conversions *Attic Add-ons *Bath &amp; Kitchen Expansions *Bump-out Additions \n\n\nPublisher: Creative Publishing international\nChris Peterson\n2011 \nISBN: 1589234820 \nLanguage: English\nASIN: B0057YD3Y4\n240 Pages \nEPUB \n32.30 MB\n\nBuilding a major addition to your house can take over your life or drain your bank account if you arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fully prepared with top-notch information.
