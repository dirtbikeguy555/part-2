Formed in 1983 under the name Legacy, they are often credited as one of the most popular bands of the 1980s thrash metal scene. In the 32 years since its inception, Testament has had numerous lineup changes, and guitarist Eric Peterson has been the only constant member, although the band currently also features another one of its original members, Alex Skolnick (guitarist). Chuck Billy replaced former singer Steve Souza in 1986, prior to the recording of their first studio album, The Legacy, and has been a member of the band since.\n\nTo date, Testament has released ten studio albums, four live albums, six compilation albums, and six singles. After signing a recording contract with Atlantic Records in 1986, they released their debut album The Legacy in 1987 to critical acclaim. Many of their subsequent albums Ã¢â‚¬â€ including The New Order (1988), Practice What You Preach (1989), Souls of Black (1990), The Ritual (1992) and The Formation of Damnation (2008) Ã¢â‚¬â€ were also successful. Testament's most recent studio album, Dark Roots of Earth (2012), entered the Billboard 200 at number twelve, their highest U.S. chart position so far. By July 2012, Testament had sold over 1.4 million albums in the U.S since the beginning of the SoundScan era.\n\n\nTestament At MySpace\nimage\n\n\n\n\n2015 The Very Best Of (Best Of) (Japanese Edition)\n\n\nTracklist:\n\nDisc One\n01 The Haunting\n02 Burnt Offerings\n03 First Strike Is Deadly\n04 The New Order\n05 Into The Pit\n06 Disciples Of The Watch\n07 Practice What You Preach\n08 Greenhouse Effect\n09 Signs Of Chaos\n10 Electric Crown\n11 So Many Lies\n12 The Ritual\n13 Return To Serenity\n14 Over The Wall\n15 Dog Faced Gods\n\nDisc Two\n01 More Than Meets The Eye\n02 Souls Of Black\n03 The Formation Of Damnation\n04 Hatreds Rise\n05 The Burning Times\n06 John Doe\n07 Careful What You Wish For\n08 Down For Life\n09 Riding The Snake\n10 The Persecuted Will not Forget\n11 The Preacher\n12 Killing Season\n13 Trial By Fire\n14 True American Hate\n15 Last Stand for Independence\n\nLabel: Atlantic Recording Corporation\n\n\nIf you like this torrent show some gratitude to site and please make a donation.
