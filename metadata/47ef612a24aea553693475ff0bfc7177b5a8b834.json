Dumbo is relegated to the circus' clown acts; it is up to his only friend, a mouse, to assist Dumbo to achieve his full potential.\n\nCAST\n\nHerman Bing      Ringmaster   \nSterling Holloway   Mr. Stork\nEdward Brophy    Timothy Mouse \nJohn McLeish    Giddy (Elephant)\nCliff Edwards    Jim Crow \nDorothy Scott    Prissy (Elephant)\nVerna Felton    Matriarch (Elephant) \nSarah Selby    Joe, The Elephant Trainer\nNoreen Gammill      Fidgity (Elephant) \nBilly Sheets    Clown\n\nFILM TRIVIA\n\nThe fourth film in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series, Dumbo is based upon the storyline written by Helen Aberson and illustrated by Harold Pearl for the prototype of a novelty toy (&quot;Roll-a-Book&quot;).[1] The main character is Jumbo Jr., a semi-anthropomorphic elephant who is cruelly nicknamed &quot;Dumbo&quot;. He is ridiculed for his big ears, but in fact he is capable of flying by using his ears as wings. Throughout most of the film, his only true friend, aside from his mother, is the mouse, Timothy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a relationship parodying the stereotypical animosity between mice and elephants.\n\nDumbo was made to recoup the financial losses of Fantasia. It was a deliberate pursuit of simplicity and economy for the Disney studio, and at 64 minutes, it is one of Disney's shortest animated features.\n\n\nMEDIA INFO\n\nLanguage: English\nRelease Date: 1942\nFormat: mkv\nRuntime: 64 min\nSound Mix: Mono (RCA Sound System)\nColor: Color (Technicolor) \n\n*** VIDEO INFO ***\nInput Type : AVC1(GVC)\nInput Size : 944 x 720\nOutput Type : YUY2\nOutput Size : 944 x 720\nFrameRate(Frame/sec) : 0.00 (23.9\n\n\n*** AUDIO INFO ***\nSampleRate(Sample/sec) : 48000\nBitRate(Bit/sample) : 16\nChannels : 2\nKBitRate(KBit/sec) : 0\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img560.imageshack.us/img560/4986/dumbothumbs.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img560.imageshack.us/img560/4986/dumbothumbs.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47ef612a24aea553693475ff0bfc7177b5a8b834","amp;dn":"+Peter+Pan+Dumbo+Pinocchio+Snow+White+-+Disney+DVD+Pack+%5Bflint%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47ef612a24aea553693475ff0bfc7177b5a8b834","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,239,97,42,36,174,165,83,105,52,117,255,11,252,113,119,181,168,184,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
