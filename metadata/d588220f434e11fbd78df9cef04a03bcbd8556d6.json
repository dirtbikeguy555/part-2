It features amazing interactions from the assembled ensemble. Joining Monk (piano) are Ray Copeland (trumpet), Gigi Gryce (alto sax), Coleman Hawkins (tenor sax), John Coltrane (tenor sax), Wilbur Ware (bass), and Art Blakey (drums). \nHearing Coltrane and Hawkins together is admittedly part of the charm in these sides. Monk's horns-rich arrangements, and the quality of the soloists to hand, has made Ã¢â‚¬Å“Monk's MusicÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ a well-loved and important part of Monk's canon.\n\n\nThelonious Monk \n\nMonkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Music\n\nRecorded in 1957, released in 1958 \n\n\n\n  CD / 2006 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
