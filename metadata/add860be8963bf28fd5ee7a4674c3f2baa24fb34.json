They were one of the pioneering groups of the Madchester movement that was active during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The band's most successful lineup consists of vocalist Ian Brown, guitarist John Squire, bassist Gary &quot;Mani&quot; Mounfield, and drummer Alan &quot;Reni&quot; Wren.\n\nThe band released their debut album, The Stone Roses, in 1989. The album was a breakthrough success for the band and garnered critical acclaim, with many critics regarding it as one of the greatest British albums ever recorded. At this time the group decided to capitalise on their success by signing to a major label; then, their current record label Silvertone would not let them out of their contract, which led to a long legal battle that culminated with the band signing with Geffen Records in 1991, and then releasing their second album Second Coming, which was met with lacklustre reviews in 1994.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:add860be8963bf28fd5ee7a4674c3f2baa24fb34","amp;dn":"The+Stone+Roses+-+Discography+%40128","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"add860be8963bf28fd5ee7a4674c3f2baa24fb34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,216,96,190,137,99,191,40,253,94,231,164,103,76,63,43,170,36,251,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
