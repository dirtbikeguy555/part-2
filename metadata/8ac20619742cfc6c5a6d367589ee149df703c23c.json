As the memory is much faster than physical hard disks, reading/writing data on a fast in-memory disk to achieve a higher performance. The virtual disk created by GiliSoft RAMDisk residing in the computer RAM accessible in Windows Explorer and other applications. Like a physical disk, a RAM disk can also be shared so as to be accessed by other computers on a network! You choose its size (depending on the amount of RAM in your system), drive letter, and file system. You can copy, move and delete files on it.\nUse a GiliSoft RAM disk to boost performance and speed up access to data. Unlike your system hard drive, a RAM disk contains no moving parts to generate noise and heat. Because your computer's memory is so much faster than the hard disk, a RAM disk greatly improves application performance. Databases, compilers, and graphic design programs process large amounts of data which tax a computer's resources. A RAM disk drive makes data more readily available, balancing the load on a processor When you browse web pages, junk data is written to your browser's cache memory. By running your browser cache in a RAM disk and not saving the disk image file when you end your session, unwanted cache files are deleted automatically, saving hard drive space. Finally, a RAM drive uses much less energy than a physical hard drive, and therefore extends the charge of a laptop computer's battery.\n\nInfo:\n- Install, don't run\n- Add reg key to the Windows registry\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/38937104093043652303.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iv.pl/images/38937104093043652303.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ac20619742cfc6c5a6d367589ee149df703c23c","amp;dn":"Gilisoft+RAMDisk+6.4.0+%5BENG%5D+%5BReg+Key%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ac20619742cfc6c5a6d367589ee149df703c23c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,194,6,25,116,44,252,108,90,109,54,117,137,238,20,157,247,3,194,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
