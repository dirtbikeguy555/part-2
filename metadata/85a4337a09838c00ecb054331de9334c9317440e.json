Hallinan\n2009\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0767928067\nISBN-13: 978-0767928069\nPDF,EPUB,MOBI \n304 pages \n4.06 MB\n\nWe forget our passwords. We pay too much to go to the gym. We think weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be happier if we lived in California (we wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t), and we think we should stick with our first answer on tests (we shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t). Why do we make mistakes? And could we do a little better? \n\nWe human beings have design flaws. Our eyes play tricks on us, our stories change in the retelling, and most of us are fairly sure weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re way above average. In Why We Make Mistakes, journalist Joseph T. Hallinan sets out to explore the captivating science of human errorÃ¢â‚¬â€how we think, see, remember, and forget, and how this sets us up for wholly irresistible mistakes.\n\nIn his quest to understand our imperfections, Hallinan delves into psychology, neuroscience, and economics, with forays into aviation, consumer behavior, geography, football, stock picking, and more. He discovers that some of the same qualities that make us efficient also make us error prone. We learn to move rapidly through the world, quickly recognizing patternsÃ¢â‚¬â€but overlooking details. Which is why thirteen-year-old boys discover errors that NASA scientists missÃ¢â‚¬â€and why you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find the beer in your refrigerator.\n\nWhy We Make Mistakes is enlivened by real-life storiesÃ¢â‚¬â€of weathermen whose predictions are uncannily accurate and a witness who sent an innocent man to jailÃ¢â‚¬â€and offers valuable advice, such as how to remember where youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve hidden something important. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn why multitasking is a bad idea, why men make errors women donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, and why most people think San Diego is west of Reno (itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not).\n\n Why We Make Mistakes will open your eyes to the reasons behind your mistakesÃ¢â‚¬â€and have you vowing to do better the next time\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85a4337a09838c00ecb054331de9334c9317440e","amp;dn":"Why+We+Make+Mistakes%3A+How+We+Look+Without+Seeing%2C+Forget+Things+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85a4337a09838c00ecb054331de9334c9317440e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,164,51,122,9,131,140,0,236,176,84,51,29,233,51,76,147,23,68,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
