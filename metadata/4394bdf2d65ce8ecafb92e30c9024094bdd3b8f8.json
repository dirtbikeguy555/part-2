Don't download it.\n\nThis is a proper NTSC DVD from the highest quality source at the correct progressive frame rate speed and audio pitch. It is better than retail.\nAll the other copies out there - even the commercial DVD releases - are sped up and sound bad.\n\nPlease seed and enjoy! Long live Pink Floyd.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4394bdf2d65ce8ecafb92e30c9024094bdd3b8f8","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+Live+at+Pompeii+%281972%29+%28ORIGINAL+CUT%29+PROPER+NTSC+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4394bdf2d65ce8ecafb92e30c9024094bdd3b8f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,148,189,242,214,92,232,236,175,185,46,48,201,2,64,148,189,211,184,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
