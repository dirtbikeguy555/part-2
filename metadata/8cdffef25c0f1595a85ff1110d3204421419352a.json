The book also reaches beyond Toyota to explain issues of human behavior in organizations and provide specific answers to questions such as:\n\n* How can we make improvement and adaptation part of everyday work throughout the organization?\n* How can we develop and utilize the capability of everyone in the organization to repeatedly work toward and achieve new levels of performance?\n* How can we give an organization the power to handle dynamic, unpredictable situations and keep satisfying customers?\n\nMike Rother explains how to improve our prevailing management approach through the use of two kata: Improvement Kata--a repeating routine of establishing challenging target conditions, working step-by-step through obstacles, and always learning from the problems we encounter; and Coaching Kata: a pattern of teaching the improvement kata to employees at every level to ensure it motivates their ways of thinking and acting.\n\nWith clear detail, an abundance of practical examples, and a cohesive explanation from start to finish, Toyota Kata gives executives and managers at any level actionable routines of thought and behavior that produce superior results and sustained competitive advantage.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReviews:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&quot;Toyota Kata gets to the essence of how Toyota manages continuous improvement and human ingenuity, through its improvement kata and coaching kata. Mike Rother explains why typical companies fail to understand the core of lean and make limited progress--and what it takes to make it a real part of your culture.&quot;\n--Jeffrey K. Liker, bestselling author of The Toyota Way\n\n&quot;By uncovering exactly what makes Toyota the standard bearer in a way that is accessible to every management level, in every industry, Rother has given the business world a true gem--Toyota Kata is a must read!&quot;\n--Keith Allman, President, Delta Faucet Company\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout the Author/s:\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMike Rother is an engineer, a teacher, and a guest researcher at the Technical University Dortmund.
