Tools include hand tools, maps, how-to books, vehicles, software, specialized devices, gizmos, websites -- and anything useful. Tools are selected and presented in the book if they are the best of kind, the cheapest, or the only thing available that will do the job. This is an oversized book which reviews over 1,500 different tools, explaining why each one is great, and what its benefits are. Indirectly the book illuminates the possibilities contained in such tools and the whole catalog serves an education outside the classroom. The content in this book was derived from ten years of user reviews published at the Cool Tools website, cool-tools.org.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ec884634e4adc802203e4cd1402f46f531421d2","amp;dn":"Cool+Tools%3A+A+Catalog+of+Possibilities","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ec884634e4adc802203e4cd1402f46f531421d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,200,132,99,78,74,220,128,34,3,228,205,20,2,244,111,83,20,33,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
