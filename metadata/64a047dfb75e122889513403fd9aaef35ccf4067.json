At the beginning of the film, the Nazis gather all their most devious and troublesome POWs and place them at a new prison camp, which was designed to be impervious to escapes. Immediately, the prisoners develop a scheme where they will leave the camp by building three separate escape tunnels. Richard Attenborough is the British soldier who masterminds the whole plan, and who commands his motley squad--featuring Charles Bronson as a Polish trench-digging expert, James Garner as an American with a talent for theft, Donald Pleasence as a masterful forger, and Steve McQueen as an American rebel--through the construction of the tunnels and, eventually, their escape. An epic adventure film, The Great Escape runs nearly three hours, featuring a rousing Elmer Bernstein score and exciting action sequences -- including a notorious motorcycle chase between McQueen and the Nazis -- the likes of which had never been seen before in Hollywood productions.\r\n\r\nThe commentary is from the Criterion DVD with historian Bruce Eder, director John Sturges, composer Elmer Bernstein, second unit director Robert E. Relyea and stuntman Bud Ekins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Steve McQueen, James Garner, Richard Attenborough\r\nDIRECTOR......: John Sturges\r\nWRITERS.......: James Clavell, W.R.
