In 1949 four Chinese women, recent immigrants to San Francisco, begin meeting to eat dim sum, play mahjong, and talk. United in shared unspeakable loss and hope, they call themselves the Joy Luck Club. Rather than sink into tragedy, they choose to gather to raise their spirits and money. &quot;To despair was to wish back for something already lost. Or to prolong what was already unbearable.&quot; Forty years later the stories and history continue.\n\nWith wit and sensitivity, Amy Tan examines the sometimes painful, often tender, and always deep connection between mothers and daughters. As each woman reveals her secrets, trying to unravel the truth about her life, the strings become more tangled, more entwined. Mothers boast or despair over daughters, and daughters roll their eyes even as they feel the inextricable tightening of their matriarchal ties. Tan is an astute storyteller, enticing readers to immerse themselves into these lives of complexity and mystery\n\n=====================\n\n\nFor more Fiction and Non Fiction Ebooks, please visit my profile :\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/dovah12/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/dovah12/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n====================\n\nDovah\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14145a035e79d4c891ba37732ba943feabe5fc0b","amp;dn":"Amy+Tan%2C+The+Joy+Luck+Club+epub+mobi+pdf+%5Bdovah%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14145a035e79d4c891ba37732ba943feabe5fc0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,20,90,3,94,121,212,200,145,186,55,115,43,169,67,254,171,229,252,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
