They were ranked No.2 in a list of Japan&amp;#039;s top 100 musicians by HMV. [1]\n\nThe band is renowned as having pioneered the Synthpop and Electropop music genres, along with Germany&amp;#039;s Kraftwerk. The principal members are Haruomi &quot;Harry&quot; Hosono (bass, keyboards), Yukihiro Takahashi (drums and percussion, lead vocals) and Ryuichi Sakamoto (keyboards).\n\nFollowing the release of the debut &quot;Yellow Magic Orchestra&quot; a live date at the Roppongi Pit Inn was seen by executives of A&amp;M Records of the USA who were in the process of setting up a partnership deal with Alfa Records. This led to the Y.M.O. being offered an international deal, at which point (early 1979) the three members decided the group would be given priority over their solo careers.\n\n\nYELLOW MAGIC ORCHESTRA - 1978\n\n1.

It contains a mixture of songs and instrumentals by YMO (including humorous reworking of Archie Bell &amp; the Drells&amp;#039; &quot;Tighten Up&quot;), interspersed with comedy sketches. These sketches are performed by the &amp;#039;Snakeman Show&amp;#039; in Japanese and English, with YMO participating in some of them. Confusingly, a compilation album of the same title but with completely different tracks was also released in the U.S. (and Australia) and a subsequent single. A still further totally different version was released in the UK.\n\n1. Technopolis\n2. Absolute Ego Dance\n3. Behind The Mask\n4. Computer Game (Theme From &amp;#039;The Circus&amp;#039;)\n5.

It was recorded during three dates of the group&amp;#039;s first tour of Europe and the USA. The group toured as a six-piece, but the guitarist Kazumi Watanabe was mixed out and replaced with more keyboards for contractual matters between record labels. Un-dubbed recordings from this tour were later released, for instance on the &quot;Faker Holic&quot; album.\n\nTracks 1-4 Live at The Venue, London Track 5 Live at The Greek Theatre, L.A.

There was also a film from this tour, and the album was later expanded, re-titled and remixed by Brian Eno. The album features &quot;Kageki na shukujo&quot;, which was released in a studio version as a single, but does not feature on any of their albums (compilations excepted).\n\nDisc 1:\n1.

Recording began in New York during December 1992 and continued until March 1993. To avoid a lawsuit, the name YMO was crossed out with a brush stroke, as they were forbidden to use the name YMO and were instead as billed as &quot;Not YMO&quot; (as Prince was calling himself The Artist Formerly Known As Prince or TAFKAP or weird outhouse symbol). The album features collaborations with the writers William Gibson and William Burroughs, both reading extracts from their works with Y.M.O. backing.\n\n1. Be A Superman \n2. Nanga Def? \n3.
