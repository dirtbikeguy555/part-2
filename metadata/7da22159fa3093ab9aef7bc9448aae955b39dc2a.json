In an interview with Metal Blast magazine, Chrigel Glanzmann revealed that he has already started writing new material for Evocation II, the follow up to their 2009 acoustic album, as well as some new metal songs; as of June 2013, however, there is no clarity as to the release date of either.\n\nDuring their tour in South America, Anna, the hurdy-gurdy player, was reported sick on 26 January 2013, and had to take a flight to Switzerland on short notice. Despite this, however, the band continued their tour without her.\n\nOn August 29, 2013, it was revealed that Eluveitie had been working on a new album, and that their Helvetios World Tour will be the last of their time playing live (apart from their Eluveitie &amp; Friends Festival) before fully working on the new album. On the 11th of December, it was revealed that Nicole Ansperger will be the successor of Meri TadiÃ„â€¡ on the violin.\n\nIn March 2014, Eluveitie won the Swiss Music Awards' Best Live Act National award. In April the same year, the band announced a headlining European tour, with support acts Arkona and SkÃƒÂ¡lmÃƒÂ¶ld. On May 14, the band announced a new album scheduled for release on August 1, 2014, titled Origins. Original artwork created by Chrigel Glanzmann was released as well, along with the theme of the album, which revolves mainly around Gaulish mythology.\n\nIn early June, the band announced on their Facebook that they will be releasing their lead single for Origins, titled &quot;King&quot;, on 13, the same month. Eluveitie released the official music video for the song on July 3.
