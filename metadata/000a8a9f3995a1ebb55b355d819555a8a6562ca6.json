Hope you guys enjoy and please seed.\n\n\n-------------------\n\n\nWhat's cool about it:\n\n- Set morals aside as you navigate Sgt. Burden and his team through harrowing predicaments and make decisions that will either save your team or sacrifice their lives for the sake of the mission.\n\n- Solve a wide variety of narrative puzzles and moral dilemmas using your own wits and burden the consequences of your choices. Do you intimidate or comfort your hostages to maintain your tenuous control of the situation? Should you kill the weakest member of your party to save on food for the strong? What is one life worth in the face of annihilation?\n\n- An innovative departure from the traditional point and click adventure taking place in six intimate, tension-filled scenarios linked together through an epic narrative of interstellar espionage.\n\n\n\nOverview:\n\n\nGods Will Be Watching is a minimalistic Ã¢â‚¬Å“point and click thrillerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ centered on despair, commitment, and sacrifice as players face narrative puzzles and moral dilemmas that will affect both the lives of your team and the people youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re are sworn to protect.\n\nSet against the backdrop of an interstellar struggle, Gods Will Be Watching follows Sgt. Burden and his crew in six tense chapters from hostage situations and wilderness survival to biological weapon prevention and agonizing torture scenarios. Each decision is crucial and players will need to choose between the lives of their team and the saving the world from genocide. There's no good or evil, just decisions, with only you and the gods as a judge to your actions.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/gods_will_be_watching&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/gods_will_be_watching&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:000a8a9f3995a1ebb55b355d819555a8a6562ca6","amp;dn":"Gods+Will+Be+Watching+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"000a8a9f3995a1ebb55b355d819555a8a6562ca6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,10,138,159,57,149,161,235,181,91,53,93,129,149,85,168,166,86,44,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
