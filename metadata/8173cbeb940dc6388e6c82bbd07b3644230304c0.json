Les MisÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rables in Concert is a concert version of the musical Les MisÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rables, produced to celebrate its 10th anniversary. It was filmed in October 1995 at the Royal Albert Hall and released on DVD and VHS in 1998 and re-released on DVD in North America in 2008. It stars Colm Wilkinson as Jean Valjean, Philip Quast as Inspector Javert, Michael Ball as Marius Pontmercy, Lea Salonga as ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°ponine, Judy Kuhn as Cosette, Ruthie Henshall as Fantine, and several others, and was directed by John Caird. The performers were chosen from London, Broadway and Australian productions of the show.\n\nProduction\n\nThis presentation uses a &quot;modernised&quot; and more orchestrated Alain BoublilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Claude-Michel SchÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶nberg score than that of the musical. The format is closer to that of a dramatic cantata rather than being fully staged; the singers stand at their microphones with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and chorus behind them, but they do wear costumes and participate in some movement. During the action scenes, the video switches to action from the stage production. A few scenes from the musical are not included in the concert, including the street brawl broken up by Javert, &quot;The Death ofGavroche&quot; and the confrontation between Marius and ThÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nardier at the wedding feast.\n\nThe second encore\n\nThe programme ends with an encore in which seventeen actors who portray Jean Valjean in seventeen different nations join Wilkinson on stage to each sing a few bars of &quot;Do You Hear the People Sing?&quot; in their native languages. They are then joined by the entire cast and choir to sing the last verse of &quot;One Day More!&quot;, receiving applause and a standing ovation. Balloons and confetti fall from the ceiling and sparklers erupt on stage as the show finishes.\n\nCast\n\nMain performers\n\nColm Wilkinson \t\tJean Valjean \t\tOriginal London/Broadway cast\nPhilip Quast \t\tJavert \tOriginal \tAustralian cast\nRuthie Henshall \tFantine \t\tReplacement London cast\nJenny Galloway \t\tMadame ThÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nardier \tReplacement London cast\nAlun Armstrong \t\tThÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©nardier \t\tOriginal London cast\nLea Salonga \t\tÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°ponine \t\tReplacement Broadway Cast\nMichael Ball \t\tMarius \t\t\tOriginal London cast\nMichael Maguire \tEnjolras \t\tOriginal Broadway cast\nJudy Kuhn \t\tCosette \t\tOriginal Broadway cast\nAnthony Crivello \tGrantaire \t\tOriginal Broadway cast\nAdam Searles \t\tGavroche \t\nHannah Chick \t\tYoung Cosette \t\nPaul Monaghan \t\tBishop of Digne \t\n\n \nThe seventeen Valjeans\n\nThe following are the seventeen Valjeans who participated in the second encore:\n\nCountry \tActor\n\n U.K\t \tPhil Cavill\n France \tRobert Marien\n Germany \tJerzy Jeske\n Japan \t\tTakeshi Kaga\n Hungary \tVikidÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡l Gyula\n Sweden \tTommy KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rberg\n Poland \tKrzysztof Stasierowski\n Netherlands \tHenk Poort\n Canada \tMichael Burgess\n Austria \tReinhard Brussman\n Australia \tRob Guest\n Norway \tÃƒÆ’Ã‹Å“ystein Wiik\n Czech Rep. \tJan JeÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ek\n Denmark \tKurt Ravn\n Ireland \tJeff Leyton\n Iceland \tEgill ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å“lafsson\n United States \tCraig Schulman","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8173cbeb940dc6388e6c82bbd07b3644230304c0","amp;dn":"Les+Miserables+-+10th+Anniversary+concert","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8173cbeb940dc6388e6c82bbd07b3644230304c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,115,203,235,148,13,198,56,142,108,130,187,208,123,54,68,35,3,4,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
