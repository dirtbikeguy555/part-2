Author Charles Bouleau explores a tremendous variety of ancient and modern works: the Parthenon friezes, Italian mosaics, the Bayeux Tapestry, and Gothic stonemasons' marks of France and Germany as well as paintings by Picasso, Kandinsky, Klee, and Pollock. His insightful expositions cast new light on such well-known works as Raphael's &quot;The School of Athens,&quot; Botticelli's &quot;Birth of Venus,&quot; Rubens' &quot;Descent from the Cross,&quot; and Renoir's &quot;Le Moulin de la Galette.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d436aa54791bbc0c9e6cb4260b546a8010c96b72","amp;dn":"The+Painter%27s+Secret+Geometry%3A+A+Study+of+Composition+in+Art","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d436aa54791bbc0c9e6cb4260b546a8010c96b72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,54,170,84,121,27,188,12,158,108,180,38,11,84,106,128,16,201,107,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
