When Carl Jung embarked on an extended self-exploration he called his ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œconfrontation with the unconscious,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the heart of it was The Red Book, a large, illuminated volume he created between 1914 and 1930. Here he developed his principle theoriesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½of the archetypes, the collective unconscious, and the process of individuationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that transformed psychotherapy from a practice concerned with treatment of the sick into a means for higher development of the personality.\n\nWhile Jung considered The Red Book to be his most important work, only a handful of people have ever seen it. Now, in a complete facsimile and translation, it is available to scholars and the general public. It is an astonishing example of calligraphy and art on a par with The Book of Kells and the illuminated manuscripts of William Blake. This publication of The Red Book is a watershed that will cast new light on the making of modern psychology. \n\nHere\\\\\\'s my first upload, enjoy\n\n\nPS: NOT for ginger kids","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9199a3e644c96e80da7ec84776d78ff8dee97e5","amp;dn":"C.G+Jung+-+The+red+book+%28manuscript+%2B+english+translation%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9199a3e644c96e80da7ec84776d78ff8dee97e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,25,154,62,100,76,150,232,13,167,236,132,119,109,120,255,141,238,151,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
