I've just experienced my first dance outside of elementary school. It's the morning after, and I'm still in a daze from the magical slow dance that I'd just experienced last night with Tara, someone I had a huge crush on...that song was &quot;Hold On To The Nights&quot;...\n\nSince then, I've come to know Richard Marx as a master of soft pop rock; with R&amp;B aftershocks vibrating through his wonderfully pleasant voice. Personal favorites like &quot;Should've Known Better&quot; and &quot;Endless Summer Nights&quot; also dominated my favorite radio station at the time, but it was 1989's &quot;Right Here Waiting&quot; that solidly established Mr. Marx as a pop icon during the era of Paula Abdul, MC Hammer and the New Kids On The Block.\n\nWords cannot express how much I appreciate and enjoy this album because it is so darn pleasant. Other standouts for me are &quot;Angelia&quot; (love this one), &quot;Children Of The Night&quot; (ditto), &quot;Hazard&quot; (lyrically haunting...), &quot;Keep Coming Back&quot; (deliciously bluesy - listen for Luther Vandross!), and &quot;Now and Forever&quot; (extremely sincere, perfect for a wedding).\n\n&quot;Satisfied&quot; and &quot;The Way She Loves Me&quot; rock in a Bryan Adams-ish sort of way, and while these songs aren't personal favorites, they're still irresistable for the zestful vibrancy they communicate.\n\n&quot;Touch Of Heaven&quot; is a pleasant surprise, and Richard's vocals are in top form here - fans of R&amp;B music will definitely appreciate this one. Randy Jackson (yes, Michael's little brother) worked on this one.\n\n...also check out the liner notes on this album; Mr. Marx shares a personal thought about every song.\nThanks for reading,\n\nC.H.R.\n\nP.S. And for all the *NSync fans out there who enjoyed &quot;This I Promise You&quot;, well, Richard Marx wrote that one too; and just so you know, *NSync co-lead singer J.C. Chasez used the song &quot;Right Here Waiting&quot; for his audition to the Mickey Mouse Club back in the early 90s...now, how's that for pop music trivia?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7d162e59df8b09bd5be12c7b4ccb3fdbda3e6d6","amp;dn":"Richard+Marx+Greatest+Hits+320cbr+1997","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7d162e59df8b09bd5be12c7b4ccb3fdbda3e6d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,209,98,229,157,248,176,155,213,190,18,199,180,204,179,253,189,163,230,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
