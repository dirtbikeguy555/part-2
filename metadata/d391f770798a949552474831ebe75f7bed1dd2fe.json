The tour was dividLed into two legs, with performances commencing on 27 May and concluding on 28 June 1972. It included two warm-up shows in Europe.\r\nThis was the first tour in which Led Zeppelin used songs from their upcoming album Houses of the Holy (&quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot;, &quot;Dancing Days&quot;, and &quot;The Ocean&quot;). This was also the last concert tour on which Led Zeppelin included an acoustic section until it was revived in 1975 for their Earls Court performances.\r\n\r\n John Bonham sang co-lead vocals with Robert Plant during the song Bron-Y-Aur Stomp. The decision to drop the acoustic set was perhaps made because their live concerts were regularly extending into three hour long marathons (and sometimes up to four and a half hours), which were becoming taxing on all four band members.\r\n\r\nTracklist Disk 1\r\n\r\n01 - Drone.mp3\r\n02 - Immigrant Song.mp3\r\n03 - Heartbreaker.mp3\r\n04 - Black Dog.mp3\r\n05 - Since Ive Been Loving You.mp3\r\n06 - Stairway To Heaven.mp3\r\n07 - Going To California.mp3\r\n08 - Thats The Way.mp3\r\n09 - Tangerine.mp3\r\n10 - Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp.mp3\r\n\r\nDisk 2\r\n\r\nD2T1 - Dazed and Confused.mp3\r\nD2T2 - What Is and What Should Never Be.mp3\r\nD2T3 - Moby Dick.mp3\r\nD2T4 - Whole Lotta Love.mp3\r\nD2T5 - Rock and Roll.mp3\r\n\r\n\r\nBootlegging is often incorrectly referred to as piracy but there are important differences between the two terms. Non-profit bootlegging is trafficking in recordings that the record companies have not commercially released, whereas piracy is the illegal copying/sale of recordings that are available commercially.\r\n\r\nSo enjoy and share with others, if you are a walmart style uploader I hope you get exactly what you deserve. I share only what I personally like/love, not for personal gain or cash. \r\n\r\nDonations NOT welcome","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d391f770798a949552474831ebe75f7bed1dd2fe","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+San+Bernadino+Ca.%28Live+2-CD%29+1972++320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d391f770798a949552474831ebe75f7bed1dd2fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,145,247,112,121,138,148,149,82,71,72,49,235,231,95,123,237,29,210,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
