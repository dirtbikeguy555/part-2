With Brian Eno's skillful production, Mark and Bob Mothersbaugh, Jerry and Bob Casale, and Alan Myers emerged fully formed and outrageous with their razor-sharp social commentary and exhibition of subversive media savvy. Beyond their industrial uniforms and pseudo-devolved demeanor, Devo also happened to be a rocking little band. Classic rave-outs like &quot;Mongoloid,&quot; &quot;Jocko Homo,&quot; and &quot;Uncontrollable Urge&quot; illustrate the band's perky-jerky intensity. On their inimitable cover of the Rolling Stones' youth anthem, &quot;Satisfaction,&quot; Devo's avant-garde robot funk takes the song to a new level of alienation and discontent. While the band went on to greater fame, this was the only album they made that truly mattered. --Mitch Meyers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fa755031eab422298a7c5e2edb53f1b1cc4137e","amp;dn":"Devo+-+Q+Are+We+Not+Men+A+We+Are+Devo%21+%40256Kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fa755031eab422298a7c5e2edb53f1b1cc4137e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,167,85,3,30,171,66,34,152,167,197,226,237,181,63,27,28,196,19,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
