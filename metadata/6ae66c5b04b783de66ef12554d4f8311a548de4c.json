Born to Haitian parents in Miramar, Florida, DerÃƒÂ¼lo started singing at an early age. He attended performing arts schools in Florida and took some early stabs at music composition, writing his first song at the age of eight. His writing skills began attracting attention, and by his teenage years, DerÃƒÂ¼lo had begun scribing tracks for artists like Lil Wayne, Pitbull, and Pleasure P. He also wrote &quot;Bossy&quot; for Birdman, a New Orleans-based rapper, and made a guest appearance on the song, which highlighted his ability as a vocalist.\n\n\nArtist...............: Jason Derulo\nAlbum................: Talk Dirty (Deluxe Edition)\nGenre................: R&amp;B\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2014\nRipper...............: NMR\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags.................: VorbisComment\nInformation..........: \n\nRipped by............: NMR\nPosted by............: vtwin88cube on 4/16/2014\nNews Server..........: \nNews Group(s)........: \n\nIncluded.............: Cue, Log, AUDIOCHECKER\nCovers...............: Front\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.Talk Dirty (Feat. 2 Chainz)\n02.Wiggle (Feat.
