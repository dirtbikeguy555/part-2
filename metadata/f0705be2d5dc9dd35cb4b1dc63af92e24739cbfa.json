How do you access a previous trance state? What is pattern interruption? Stacked realities? Generative change? Reframing? And how in the world do you use all this stuff to do anything productive? Better yet, how do you keep from using all this stuff to be unproductive? Well, this will give a you a taste of what lies in store for you in this book. It's the best book to learn about real hypnosis, the structure of hypnosis.\n\nThere are many books that can teach you to hypnotize people, but few that can teach you to break through the consensual trance that you are already in. This book can get you on the road to doing that. &quot;Hypnosis is a word that usually gets strong responses from people&quot; - positive or negative.\n\nOften, people associate trance states with mysticism or magic, which has not helped the reputation of hypnosis. We encourage skeptics to suspend their beliefs or assumptions about hypnosis long enough to read this book. NLP cofounders Bandler and Grinder studied the famous therapist Milton Erickson to determine the structure of hypnosis. This book turns the &quot;magic&quot; into specific understandable procedures, some of which are useful in everyday conversation.\n\nIn addition to the hows of hypnosis (basic and advanced), the authors describe numerous important uses for this science. A great introduction to the subject - and an important reference book for hypnosis practitioners.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout the Authors:\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJohn Grinder, Ph.D. (born January 10, 1940) is an American linguist, author, management consultant, trainer and speaker.
