These algorithms surpass the quality of all classic noise reduction methods and even that of the wavelet-based methods. Although the wavelet-based methods were developed only 15-20 years ago and are still considered relatively modern, Neat Video uses an even newer and more efficient approach to noise reduction. This approach allows drawing a more clear distinction between noise and details in noisy video data. This helps Neat Video reduce more noise and better preserve true details in digital video clips.\n\n                ____________________________________________________\n\n\nTested clean on a Windows 8 x64 virtual machine running with ESET Nod 32 5.2.9.1\nVirus database v.8272 (2013 04 26)\nTested crack and stability on Windows 7 x64 with Adobe Premiere Pro Cs-6\nTime tested: + 10 hours\n\nIT WILL RUN ONLY ON Windows 64-bit (as premiere pro is 64-bit only)\n\nIT SHOULD WORK WITH PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF PREMIERE PRO.
