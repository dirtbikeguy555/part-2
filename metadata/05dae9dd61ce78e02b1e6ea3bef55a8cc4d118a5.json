At eighteen, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven.  His writings cover many subjects -- including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government -- and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy.  Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip of Macedonia, tutored Alexander the Great between 356 and 323 BCE.\n\nAristotle's views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval and Renaissance scholarship and were not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics.  His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, which was incorporated in the late 19th century into modern formal logic.  In metaphysics, Aristotelianism profoundly influenced Judeo-Islamic philosophical and theological thought during the Middle Ages and continues to influence Christian theology, especially the scholastic tradition of the Catholic Church.  Aristotle was well known among medieval Muslim intellectuals and revered as &quot;The First Teacher&quot;.  His ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics.\n\nAll aspects of Aristotle's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today.  Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues -- Cicero described his literary style as &quot;a river of gold&quot; -- it is thought that only around a third of his original output has survived.\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF format unless otherwise indicated:\n\n* THE ART OF RHETORIC (Penguin Classics, 2004).
