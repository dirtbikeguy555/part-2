Since in-depth quantitative modeling techniques are a powerful tool to understanding the drivers associated with financial problems, one would need a solid grasp of these techniques before being able to unlock their full potential of the methods used. In The Mathematics of Financial Models, the author presents real world solutions to the everyday problems facing financial professionals. With interactive tools such as spreadsheets for valuation, pricing, and modeling, this resource combines highly mathematical quantitative analysis with useful, practical methodologies to create an essential guide for investment and risk-management professionals facing modeling issues in insurance, derivatives valuation, and pension benefits, among others. In addition to this, this resource also provides the relevant tools like matrices, calculus, statistics and numerical analysis that are used to build the quantitative methods used.\n\nFinancial analysts, investment professionals, risk-management professionals, and graduate students will find applicable information throughout the book, and gain from the self-study exercises and the refresher course on key mathematical topics. Equipped with tips and information, The Mathematics of Financial Models\n\n-Provides practical methodologies based on mathematical quantitative analysis to help analysts, investment and risk-management professionals better navigate client issues\n-Contains interactive tools that demonstrate the power of analysis and modeling\n-Helps financial professionals become more familiar with the challenges across a range of industries\n-Includes a mathematics refresher course and plenty of exercises to get readers up to speed\n\nThe Mathematics of Financial Models is an in-depth guide that helps readers break through common client financial problems and emerge with clearer strategies for solving issues in the future.\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPreface ix\n\nAcknowledgments xi\n\nCHAPTER 1 Setting the Stage 1\n\nWhy Is This Book Different? 2\n\nRoad Map of the Book 3\n\nReferences 5\n\nCHAPTER 2 Building Zero Curves 7\n\nMarket Instruments 8\n\nLinear Interpolation 16\n\nCubic Splining 25\n\nAppendix: Finding Swap Rates Using a Floating Coupon\n\nBond Approach 41\n\nReferences 43\n\nCHAPTER 3 Valuing Vanilla Options 45\n\nBlack-Scholes Formulae 47\n\nAdaptations of the Black-Scholes Formulae 53\n\nLimitations of the Black-Scholes Formulae 70\n\nApplication in Currency Risk Management 74\n\nAppendix 78\n\nReferences 80\n\nCHAPTER 4 Simulations 81\n\nUniform Number Generation 82\n\nNon-Uniform Number Generation 86\n\nApplications of Simulations 93\n\nVariance Reduction Techniques 100\n\nReferences 104\n\nCHAPTER 5 Valuing Exotic Options 107\n\nValuing Path-Independent, European-Style Options on a Single Variable 108\n\nValuing Path-Dependent, European-Style Options on a Single Variable 114\n\nValuing Path-Independent, European-Style Options on Two Variables 135\n\nValuing Path-Dependent, European-Style Options on Multiple Variables 152\n\nReferences 157\n\nCHAPTER 6 Estimating Model Parameters 159\n\nCalibration of Parameters in the Black-Scholes Model 161\n\nUsing Implied Black-Scholes Volatility Surface and Zero Rate Term Structure to Value Options 169\n\nUsing Volatility Surface 178\n\nCalibration of Interest Rate Option Model Parameters 190\n\nStatistical Estimation 196\n\nReferences 203\n\nCHAPTER 7 The Effectiveness of Hedging Strategies 205\n\nDelta Hedging 206\n\nAssumptions Underlying Delta Hedging 216\n\nBeyond Delta Hedging 223\n\nTesting Hedging Strategies 230\n\nAnalysis Associated with the Hedging of a European-Style Vanilla Put Option 235\n\nReferences 244\n\nCHAPTER 8 Valuing Variable Annuity Guarantees 245\n\nBasic GMDB 246\n\nDeath Benefit Riders 261\n\nOther Details Associated with GMDB Products 269\n\nImproving Modeling Assumptions 273\n\nLiving Benefit Riders 276\n\nReferences 279\n\nCHAPTER 9 Real Options 281\n\n Surrendering a GMAB Rider 282\n\nAdding Servers in a Queue 300\n\nReferences 314\n\nCHAPTER 10 Parting Thoughts 315\n\nAbout the Author 317\n\nAbout the Website 319\n\nIndex 321\n\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nDR.
