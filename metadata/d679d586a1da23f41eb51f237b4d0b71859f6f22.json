He founded U.S. Steel, a conglomeration of leading steel and iron producers, which was the nationâ€™s largest coast-to-coast railroad system, and the first company to be worth more than $1 billion.\r\n \r\nMorgan was also instrumental in developing the Federal Reserve after working with political leaders to prevent a potentially devastating fiscal crisis in 1907. Indeed, he was a driving force in the modernization of American business, and the effects of his acumen and foresight continue to resonate todayâ€”on Wall Street and beyond.\r\n \r\nAdditionally, known for his displays of wealth and power, Morgan was a prominent figure of the New York society sceneâ€”a member of the original one percentâ€”as well as a notable art connoisseur with a sizable collection now housed in Manhattanâ€™s lavish Morgan Library &amp; Museum, once his own private library.\r\n \r\nIn this meticulously researched and comprehensive biography, Frederick Lewis Allen, former editor of Harperâ€™s magazine and author of Only Yesterday, delves into the life and character of a fascinating, multidimensional man. Allen also probes the evolution of the business landscape during Morganâ€™s lifetime, when giant corporations with unparalleled economies of scale began to absorb and replace smaller competitors","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d679d586a1da23f41eb51f237b4d0b71859f6f22","amp;dn":"The+Great+Pierpont+Morgan%3A+A+Biography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d679d586a1da23f41eb51f237b4d0b71859f6f22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,121,213,134,161,218,35,244,30,181,31,35,123,77,11,113,133,159,111,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
