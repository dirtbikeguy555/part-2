Feel free to download it if you want. If anyone starts bitching at me about it being from both of their releases then I ask you this: Who are they to bitch at me? And who are you to say anything?\n\nI have purchased all of these (for the most part &gt;_&gt;) so I've done my due-diligence.\n\nIncluded is everything to run the base game with all DLC's and SKSE simply Unzip to any part of your hard-drive and create a shortcut. Everything works out of the box, no install, or anything. When you run the Launcher (WHICH YOU REALLY REALLY REALLY SHOULD DO) first it will say &quot;Install&quot; instead of play. Just click install and it will run normally.\n\nGood day,\n\nSymVoid","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48006057e60c25c85425534f508708eb96524d8e","amp;dn":"Skyrim+1.9.32.0.8+%2B+SKSE+1.9+%2B+All+DLC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48006057e60c25c85425534f508708eb96524d8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,0,96,87,230,12,37,200,84,37,83,79,80,135,8,235,150,82,77,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
