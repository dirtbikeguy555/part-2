I already own the printed version of the book and I needed an electronic copy to carry with me anywhere I go. I hope you use it the same way.\n\nThe printed book is a must-have bible of food science, easier to read and dirty cheap anyway. Buying it you support mr McGee and his colossal contribution to modern cooking.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27f7dfbd300765c2f8222380fd95304fd40c27d9","amp;dn":"On+Food+and+Cooking%2C+Harold+McGee+%5Bfull+photos+and+tables%5D.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27f7dfbd300765c2f8222380fd95304fd40c27d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,247,223,189,48,7,101,194,248,34,35,128,253,149,48,79,212,12,39,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
