Rockefeller, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Andrew Carnegie, Henry Ford and J.P. Morgan rose from obscurity and in the process built modern America. Their names hang on street signs, are etched into buildings and are a part of the fabric of history. These men created the American Dream and were the engine of capitalism as they transformed everything they touched in building the oil, rail, steel, shipping, automobile and finance industries. Their paths crossed repeatedly as they elected presidents, set economic policies and influenced major events of the 50 most formative years this country has ever known. From the Civil War to the Great Depression and World War I, they led the way.\nUsing state of the art computer generated imagery that incorporates 12 million historical negatives, many made available for the first time by the Library of Congress, this series will bring back to life the world they knew and the one they created. The event series will show how these men took a failed experiment in democracy and created the greatest superpower the world has ever seen. We see how their historic achievements came to create the America of today.\n\n\n\n\n4)  Blood is Spilled \nCarnegie hires a hatchet man, Henry Frick, to help him achieve his goal of besting Rockefeller. The partnership seems promising, but Carnegie does not know that Frick is running his factories far beyond capacity. Frick cuts corners and soon the pair is responsible for the biggest manmade disaster America has ever seen until that time: the Johnstown flood, which claims more than 2,000 lives. Carnegie hates being disliked and his initial impetus to seek revenge becomes the furthest thing from his mind.\n\n5)  A New Rival Emerges \nWhile Carnegie and Rockefeller continue to battle, JP Morgan arrives on the scene and establishes a bank in New York City that has one goal: to further the technological advancements of America. Morgan s first investment is in Thomas Edison's new development - electric light.\n\n6)  Owning It All \nWith an investment from Morgan, the Edison Electric Company is created and begins wiring homes in New York. A rival, Nikola Tesla, soon emerges with a different technology for electric light. Edison is convinced his is better and goes to war with Tesla. As things escalate, Morgan begins to lose faith. Eventually, Tesla's technology prevails and his theory of Alternating Current (AC) becomes the standard. Morgan fires Edison and renames Edison Electric Company as General Electric (GE). GE is still one of the biggest companies in the world today. Edison vows never to work with electricity again. He begins work on his motion picture camera.\n\n7)  Taking the White House \nVanderbilt, Rockefeller, Carnegie and Morgan have gone unmonitored for decades, but American politicians are about to change that. They want these men to fall into line under government control. The men, some lifelong enemies, come together with a plan to buy the White House by donating the modern day equivalent of $30 million to Ohio Governor, William McKinley. McKinley intends to repay his backers; he repeals regulation after regulation to allow them the freedom to do unimaginable things without consequence or impediment. Morgan and Carnegie create US Steel, the first billion dollar company while Rockefeller takes control of 90% of North American oil.\n\n8)  The New Machine \nA young engineer named Henry Ford devises the plan for a gas-powered car. McKinley is assassinated and his Vice President Theodore Roosevelt takes office and quickly passes a series of regulations increasing oversight of American business. Ford receives his financial backing and comes up with the concept of the assembly line. He targets the middle class with his new product and changes the landscape of America. Rockefeller is put on trial for anti-trust violations. He loses in court and his company, Standard Oil, is one of the first monopolies broken up by the US government. JP Morgan helps to establish the Federal Reserve. This cements Morgan's legacy as the father of modern capitalism. Carnegie, still reeling from his culpability in the Johnstown disaster, gives away much of his fortune. His example of charity paves the way for individuals like Bill Gates who will do the same.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img27.imageshack.us/img27/3373/themenwhobuiltamericasc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img27.imageshack.us/img27/3373/themenwhobuiltamericasc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img820.imageshack.us/img820/3373/themenwhobuiltamericasc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img820.imageshack.us/img820/3373/themenwhobuiltamericasc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/3373/themenwhobuiltamericasc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img607.imageshack.us/img607/3373/themenwhobuiltamericasc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/3373/themenwhobuiltamericasc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/3373/themenwhobuiltamericasc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/3373/themenwhobuiltamericasc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img842.imageshack.us/img842/3373/themenwhobuiltamericasc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/4392/themenwhobuiltamericasca.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/4392/themenwhobuiltamericasca.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img145.imageshack.us/img145/3373/themenwhobuiltamericasc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img145.imageshack.us/img145/3373/themenwhobuiltamericasc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/3373/themenwhobuiltamericasc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/3373/themenwhobuiltamericasc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/3373/themenwhobuiltamericasc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/3373/themenwhobuiltamericasc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/3373/themenwhobuiltamericasc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/3373/themenwhobuiltamericasc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img254.imageshack.us/img254/3373/themenwhobuiltamericasc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img254.imageshack.us/img254/3373/themenwhobuiltamericasc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/3373/themenwhobuiltamericasc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img69.imageshack.us/img69/3373/themenwhobuiltamericasc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;eba68a8285aba7d8c5da&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 2164 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16.9\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 Kbps AVC 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: 2\n * Run-Time: Average 44mins\n * Framerate: 29 FPS\n * Number of Parts: 8\n * Container mkv\n * Part Size: average 665 MB\n * Source: BluRay DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.history.co.uk/shows/the-men-who-built-america/about.html#bottomOfHeader&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.history.co.uk/shows/the-men-who-built-america/about.html#bottomOfHeader&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4307589198931a28e3baf70caf6a32607ddd0d74","amp;dn":"The+Men+Who+Built+America+4of8+Blood+is+Spilled+BDRip+720p+x264+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4307589198931a28e3baf70caf6a32607ddd0d74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,7,88,145,152,147,26,40,227,186,247,12,175,106,50,96,125,221,13,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
