However, the results of these experiments, launched in 1963 by Britain's Granada Television, are anything but mundane, and their revelations about society, maturation, and the human condition were compiled into six extraordinary films, packaged together for the first time in this five-disc set. We meet the 14 children whose lives we will follow for the next 36 years in Seven Up, a episode of the television series The World in Action and directed by Paul Almond. What becomes evident almost immediately is that class and background will have an indelible effect on the kids for the rest of their lives; the upper-class boys and girls seem confident to the point of boorishness, while the middle- and working-class children seem resigned to a life of hard work or inevitable failure due to their backgrounds.\n\nVideo Track: Divx4\nAudio Track: Mp3\nData Rate: 1000 kbs\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1da7f40b402dc41b5ba8788922411b4e1428d083","amp;dn":"7+Up.The+Up+Series.Michael+Apted.Documentary.%28Divx_Mp3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1da7f40b402dc41b5ba8788922411b4e1428d083","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,167,244,11,64,45,196,27,91,168,120,137,34,65,27,78,20,40,208,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
