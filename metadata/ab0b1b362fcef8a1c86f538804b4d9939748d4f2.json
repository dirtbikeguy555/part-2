Cut Copy started in 2001 as a solo project by songwriter, producer, and DJ Dan Whitford, who released the single 1981 and the EP I Thought of Numbers before drafting in other members to fill out his synth and sample-based sound. Bassist and guitarist Tim Hoey and drummer Mitchell Scott debuted on Cut Copy's first full-length album, Bright Like Neon Love, released in the summer of 2004. After several successful singles were spun off the album (including Saturdays, Future, and Going Nowhere), Universal's Island Records imprint picked up the trio's international distribution in 2006. Following an inventive Whitford live DJ mix that was released in 2006 as Fabriclive.29 (including such unexpected delights as Ciccone Youth's noisy deconstruction &quot;Into the Groove(y)&quot; and Roxy Music's suave &quot;Angel Eyes&quot; alongside the usual Goldfrapp and Soulwax), the band proper returned in early 2007 with a new single, Hearts on Fire. Cut Copy's third album, In Ghost Colors, debuted at the top of Australia's ARIA charts in 2008 and was placed on a number of publications' year-end lists. After adding a fourth member, bassist Ben Browning, the group released its third studio album, Zonoscope, in 2011. \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\nLabel:\t\t\tModular Interscope\t\t\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Need You Know\n02.Take Me Over\n03.Where I'm Going\n04.Pharaohs &amp; Pyramids\n05.Blink And You'll Miss A Revolution\n06.Strange Nostalgia For The Future\n07.This Is All We've Got\n08.Alisa\n09.Hanging Onto Every Heartbeat\n10.Corner Of The Sky\n11.Sun God\n\n\n\n\n             \n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                    ****Please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab0b1b362fcef8a1c86f538804b4d9939748d4f2","amp;dn":"Cut+Copy+-+Zonoscope+%282011%29+mp3+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab0b1b362fcef8a1c86f538804b4d9939748d4f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,11,27,54,47,206,248,161,200,111,83,136,4,180,217,147,151,72,212,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
