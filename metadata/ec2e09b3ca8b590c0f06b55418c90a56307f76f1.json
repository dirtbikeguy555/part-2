However, it was the singer's third album, Good Girl Gone Bad, that made her a full-fledged international pop star with a regular presence atop the charts. Born Robyn Rihanna Fenty on February 20, 1988, in Saint Michael, Barbados, she exhibited a certain star quality as a young child, often winning beauty and talent contests. Because she lived on the fairly remote island of Barbados in the West Indies, however, she never foresaw the sort of stardom that would later befall her.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art/ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\nDisc One\n\n01.Umbrella\n02.Push Up On Me\n03.Don't Stop The Music\n04.Breakin' Dishes\n05.Shut Up And Drive\n06.Hate That I Love You\n07.Say It\n08.Sell Me Candy\n09.Lemme Get That\n10.Rehab\n11.Question Existing\n12.Good Girl Gone Bad\n\n\nDisc Two\n\n01.Umbrella (Seamus Haji &amp; Paul Emanuel Remix)\n02.Breakin' Dishes (Soul Seekerz Remix)\n03.Don't Stop The Music (The Wideboys Club Mix)\n04.Question Existing (The Wideboys Club Mix)\n05.Hate That I Love You (K-Klassic Remix)\n06.Push Up On Me (Moto Blanco Club Mix)\n07.Good Girl Gone Bad (Soul Seekerz Remix)\n08.Haunted (Steve Mac Classic Mix)\n09.Say It (Soul Seekerz Remix)\n10.Cry (Steve Mac Classic Mix)\n11.S.O.S.
