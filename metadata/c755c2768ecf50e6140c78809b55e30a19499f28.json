You'll learn how to program-a useful skill by itself-but you'll also discover how to use programming as a means to an end. \r\n\r\nAuthors Allen Downey and Chris Mayfield start with the most basic concepts and gradually move into topics that are more complex, such as recursion and object-oriented programming. \r\n\r\nEach brief chapter covers the material for one week of a college course and includes exercises to help you practice what you've learned. Learn one concept at a time: tackle complex topics in a series of small steps with examples Understand how to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and write programs clearly and accurately Determine which development techniques work best for you, and practice the important skill of debugging. Learn relationships among input and output, decisions and loops, classes and methods, strings and arrays. Work on exercises involving word games, graphics, puzzles, and playing cards","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c755c2768ecf50e6140c78809b55e30a19499f28","amp;dn":"Think+Java+-+How+to+Think+Like+a+Computer+Scientist+%282016%29Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c755c2768ecf50e6140c78809b55e30a19499f28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,85,194,118,142,207,80,230,20,12,120,128,155,85,227,10,25,73,159,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
