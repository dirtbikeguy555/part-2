In the video, computer renderings and animations reconstruct the &quot;very primitive machine&quot; that protected the king's chamber, according to the findings of archaeologist Mark Lehner of the Ancient Egypt Research Associates.\r\nConsisting of several granite blocks dropped into grooves and down shafts to block the entrances to the king's chamber, this ancient security mechanism has been known to archaeologists for well over 200 years. However, more recent claims suggest that the king's chamber may not have been Khufu's actual burial chamber, but rather a decoy to deter grave robbers from looting his treasures or damaging his mummy. According to Lehner's findings, the king's chamber was &quot;probably already robbed of its contents sometime between the end of Khufu's reign and the collapse of the Old Kingdom&quot; around 2134 BC.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4e/Unearthed-Dark-Secrets-of-the-Pyramid-Screen0.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/5/51/Unearthed-Dark-Secrets-of-the-Pyramid-Screen1.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/9/9f/Unearthed-Dark-Secrets-of-the-Pyramid-Screen2.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/a/a9/Unearthed-Dark-Secrets-of-the-Pyramid-Screen3.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/3/3a/Unearthed-Dark-Secrets-of-the-Pyramid-Screen4.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/4/42/Unearthed-Dark-Secrets-of-the-Pyramid-Screen5.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/8/8b/Unearthed-Dark-Secrets-of-the-Pyramid-Screen6.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/5/57/Unearthed-Dark-Secrets-of-the-Pyramid-Screen7.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/a/ae/Unearthed-Dark-Secrets-of-the-Pyramid-Screen8.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/b/bc/Unearthed-Dark-Secrets-of-the-Pyramid-Screen9.jpg\r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/73/Unearthed-Dark-Secrets-of-the-Pyramid-Screen10.jpg\r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/56/Unearthed-Dark-Secrets-of-the-Pyramid-Screen11.jpg\r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/25/Unearthed-Dark-Secrets-of-the-Pyramid-Screen12.jpg\r\n\r\n  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7b/Unearthed-Dark-Secrets-of-the-Pyramid-Screen13.jpg\r\n\r\n  \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/29/Unearthed-Dark-Secrets-of-the-Pyramid-Screen14.jpg\r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/36/Unearthed-Dark-Secrets-of-the-Pyramid-Screen15.jpg\r\n \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF-21 (~3970 Kbps)\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 44 mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Container MP4\r\n * Part Size: 1.24 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \r\n * http://www.madamasr.com/news/archaeologists-explore-ancient-security-system-great-pyramid-giza","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bbd27557b0545338c6d790890d756f95b5e032d","amp;dn":"Science.Ch.Unearthed.Series.1.Dark.Secrets.of.the.Pyramid.720p.H","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bbd27557b0545338c6d790890d756f95b5e032d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,189,39,85,123,5,69,51,140,109,121,8,144,215,86,249,91,94,3,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
