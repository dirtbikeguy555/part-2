Centered on guitarist, keyboardist, songwriter, and producer Tom Scholz, the band is a staple of classic rock radio playlists. Boston's best-known works include the songs &quot;More Than a Feeling&quot;, &quot;Peace of Mind&quot;, &quot;Foreplay/Long Time&quot;, &quot;Rock and Roll Band&quot;, &quot;Smokin'&quot;, &quot;Don't Look Back&quot; and &quot;Amanda.&quot; They have sold over 31 million albums in the United States, of which 17 million are their self-titled debut album and 7 million are their second album, Don't Look Back.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe debut album, Boston, released on August 8, 1976, was an enormous success. The record ranks as the best-selling debut album in U.S. history with over 17 million copies sold.\n\nDuring the summer and fall of 1976, Boston attracted much publicity due to the unprecedented record sales by an unknown act, its unique sound, and singer Brad Delp's vocal abilities. However, there was &quot;a conscious effort to de-emphasize Scholz as the total mastermind behind Boston.&quot; After opening for Black Sabbath, Blue Ãƒâ€“yster Cult, Foghat and others, the band embarked on a headlining tour in the winter and spring of 1977 to support the album. This helped establish Boston as one of rock's top acts within a short time, being nominated for a Grammy award as a &quot;Best New Artist&quot;. Boston was the first band in history to make their New York City debut at Madison Square Garden.\n\nThe album spawned three singles, &quot;More Than a Feeling&quot;, &quot;Long Time&quot; and &quot;Peace of Mind&quot;, all of which made the national charts. Additionally, the album peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and remained on the charts for 132 weeks.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b56d8e8c0c58dc8fa7066d3b1a1ec07f3d42e26","amp;dn":"Boston+-+Boston+%5B1976%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b56d8e8c0c58dc8fa7066d3b1a1ec07f3d42e26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,86,216,232,192,197,141,200,250,112,102,211,177,161,236,7,243,212,46,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
