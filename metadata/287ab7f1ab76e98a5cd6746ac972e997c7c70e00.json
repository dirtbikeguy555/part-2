Further, the sound quality is decidedly spotty, and Charly's legal right to put Chess material on the market at all has long been in question. But this is the only place CD enthusiasts are currently going to find more than a few indispensable 1950s sides that MCA hasn't gotten around to releasing quite yet. And the final disc holds some enlightening alternate takes (including a whopping eight runthroughs of &quot;Woman Wanted&quot; and nine versions of &quot;Read Way Back&quot;) that may never see domestic light of day. For aficionados only, make no mistake.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:287ab7f1ab76e98a5cd6746ac972e997c7c70e00","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Muddy+Waters+1947-1967+On+Chess+%5B9cd%5D+%5BCBR+320kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"287ab7f1ab76e98a5cd6746ac972e997c7c70e00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,122,183,241,171,118,233,138,92,214,116,106,201,114,233,151,199,199,14,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
