Loving ourselves and others is in our genetic code. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing other than the purpose of our livesÃ¢â‚¬â€but knowing that doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make it easy to do. We may find it a challenge to love ourselves. We may have a hard time letting love in from others. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re often afraid of getting hurt. It is also sometimes scary for us to share love with those around usÃ¢â‚¬â€and love that isn't shared leaves us feeling flat and unfulfilled.\n=======================================\n\nIt's the Way You Say It: Becoming Articulate, Well-Spoken, and Clear\n\nCarol A. Fleming\n2013 \nISBN: 1609947436 \n240 pages \nEPUB \n3.2 MB\n\nMost people don't like the sound of their voice - but for some, their vocal and communication habits are holding back professional success. Typical problems include: voice pitches too high, nasal and gravelly, mumbling, swallowing of words, speech too soft - people constantly asking to speak up, speaking too fast, difficulty making small talk, difficulty making eye contact, stage fright and interrupting others.\n Other books address some of these issues but are not grounded in speech science and professional expertise. With dozens of years under her belt as a Ph.D. speech therapist and pathologist, Carol Fleming can get every reader to the right solutions quickly.\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThe Do's and Don'ts of Entering a Relationship\n\nStephen Robinson\n2013\nASIN: B00BOOMRW0 \nEPUB \n51 pages  \n258 KB\n\n\n Highly Recommended Book on Dating/Relationships\n Are you looking for a relationship?\n Are you about to start a relationship?\n Are you already in a relationship?\n\n If either one of these applies to you the you have to read this book.
