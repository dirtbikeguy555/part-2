Packed with behind-the-scenes storiesÃ¢â‚¬â€from a day in the writersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ room at The Onion to why a sketch does or doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make it onto Saturday Night Live to how the BBC nearly erased the entire first season of Monty PythonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Flying CircusÃ¢â‚¬â€Poking a Dead Frog is a must-read for comedy buffs, writers and pop culture junkies alike.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“No one generates more interesting, revealing, or entertaining interviews than Mike Sacks. Poking a Dead Frog is a classic.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nÃ¢â‚¬â€Bob Odenkirk\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This book is what I really look forward to in a book about humor: rich with words and humor, and funny stories with words. Thank you for your time.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Will Ferrell\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“These interviews go to dark depths and offer useful, applicable insight into how excellent comedy is written. If you read it, you're going to be better at writing comedy and may even wind up in a position where you can take jobs away from the younger interviewees. I specify the younger interview subjects because some of the older ones will die soon.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Rob Delaney\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I wish I'd had a book like this when I was trying to break in. Also, a book on personal hygiene.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Jack Handey","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44dd6a3311066aab3834ed244dd69dc29003fc3e","amp;dn":"Poking+a+Dead+Frog%3A+Conversations+with+Today%26rsquo%3Bs+Top+Comedy+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44dd6a3311066aab3834ed244dd69dc29003fc3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,221,106,51,17,6,106,171,56,52,237,36,77,214,157,194,144,3,252,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
