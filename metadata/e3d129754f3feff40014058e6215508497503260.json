This course shows how to create basic servlets and Facelets (Faces' view templates) and build simple data-management applications with Java EE. Author Patrick Royal also shares parallel-processing tips that save you time on both ends of servlet transactions, along with tricks for extending servlets and increasing your Java application's cross-compatibility.\nTopics include:\n\n Creating simple Java EE servlets\n Setting up a JavaServer Faces application\n Developing managed beans\n Working with web context\n Handling servlet life-cycle events\n Developing parallel-capable servlets\n Optimizing Java EE code\n Enabling security\n Creating custom components and renderers\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3d129754f3feff40014058e6215508497503260","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Java+EE+Essentials%3A+Servlets+and+JavaServer+Faces+with+P","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3d129754f3feff40014058e6215508497503260","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,209,41,117,79,63,239,244,0,20,5,142,98,21,80,132,151,80,50,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
