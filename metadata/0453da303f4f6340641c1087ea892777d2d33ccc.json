He transformed his only top ten single, &quot;Margaritaville&quot;, from just a mere song, into a successful restaurant, clothing line, a brand of tequilas and inspired a way of live for a nation of Parrotheads. Even though &quot;Margaritaville&quot; is his biggest hit, he is by no means a one hit wonder. In fact that song isn't even his best. Songs like &quot;A Pirate Looks At 40&quot;, &quot;Son Of A Son Of A Sailor&quot;, &quot;He Went To Paris&quot; &amp; &quot;Come Monday&quot; are all superior songs and the rest of the album is made up of similarly excellent songs. If you are a novice to the music of Jimmy Buffett, this is the place to start.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0453da303f4f6340641c1087ea892777d2d33ccc","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Buffett%27s+Greatest+Hits+-+Songs+You+Know+by+Heart+320cbr+%28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0453da303f4f6340641c1087ea892777d2d33ccc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,83,218,48,63,79,99,64,100,28,16,135,234,137,39,119,210,211,60,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
