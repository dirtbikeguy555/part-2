This text is distinctive in making molecular perspectives accessible at the introductory level and connecting properties with practical implications.\n\nFeatures of the second edition include\n\nHierarchical instruction with increasing levels of detail: Content requiring deeper levels of theory is clearly delineated in separate sections and chapters.\n\nEarly introduction to the overall perspective of composite systems like distillation columns, reactive processes, and biological systems.\n\nLearning objectives, problem-solving strategies for energy balances and phase equilibria, chapter summaries, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“important equationsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for every chapter.\n\nExtensive practical examples, especially coverage of non-ideal mixtures, which include water contamination via hydrocarbons, polymer blending/recycling, oxygenated fuels, hydrogen bonding, osmotic pressure, electrolyte solutions, zwitterions and biological molecules, and other contemporary issues.\n\nSupporting software in formats for both MATLABÃ‚Â® and spreadsheets.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7653f763fd2b4c56a625aecd56cf6f32eb8580f5","amp;dn":"Introductory+Chemical+Engineering+Thermodynamics+%5BMobi%5D%7EStormRG%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7653f763fd2b4c56a625aecd56cf6f32eb8580f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,83,247,99,253,43,76,86,166,37,174,205,86,207,111,50,235,133,128,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
