Individual historical eras or civilisations are defined and named as in the books, with sketches from several different time periods combined within a single episode. Live-action sketchesÃ¢â‚¬â€which often parody other UK media or celebritiesÃ¢â‚¬â€and music videos are intercut with animations and quizzes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c56a9bf35d1857ae1d05d96307019e0edb7cc925","amp;dn":"Horrible+Histories+season+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c56a9bf35d1857ae1d05d96307019e0edb7cc925","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,106,155,243,93,24,87,174,29,5,217,99,7,1,158,14,219,124,201,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
