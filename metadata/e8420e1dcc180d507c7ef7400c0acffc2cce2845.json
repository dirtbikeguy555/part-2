Will you succumb to madness and cannibalism on the black waters? Or return home triumphant with a hold full of precious loot? Events can turn out differently every game - sometimes, even if you make the same choices. Will you lose your sweetheart to a curse? Redeem, betray or consume the Genial Magician? Sell your soul to the Wistful Deviless or spurn her advances? Is the Dawn Machine your salvation, or your doom?\nYou are the captain. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your call.\n\n\n== Features\n\n- A deep, compelling world packed with 200,000+ words of stories and secrets.\n- Light and dark. Stray too far from the gas-lamps of civilisation and your crew will grow fearful and eventually lose their sanity. But there is treasure out there in the darknessÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n- Beautiful, hand drawn art - castles of sparkling ice, prisons perched on lily pads, fog-shrouded lighthouses and the DAWN MACHINE. \n- Upgrade your steamship with powerful engines, flensing cannons, and pneumatic torpedo guns. Or just buy a bigger, better ship.\n- Hire unique officers like the Haunted Doctor and the Irrepressible Cannoneer. Each has a story to tell, if you can draw it out of them.\n- Choose from a menagerie of shipÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mascots: the Comatose Ferret, the Wretched Mog, the Elegiac Cockatoo, and more!\n- Trade silk and souls, mushroom wine, and hallucinogenic honey.\n\n\n\n== Version: v1.0.1.2004 or GOG setup v2.2.0.3 from 6th March 2015 ==\n\n\n\n== Version changes:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gog.com/forum/sunless_sea/sunless_sea_has_been_updated_to_version_1012004&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gog.com/forum/sunless_sea/sunless_sea_has_been_updated_to_version_1012004&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n== Instructions:\n\nIt's a GOG version, just launch setup\nClick options to chose location and accept EULA, install and play\nEnjoy &amp; Seed\n\n== System requirements:Minimum:\n\nPentium 4 2.20GHz/Athlon XP 2200+\nGeForce 210/Radeon X600 Series\n1 GB RAM \nWin Xp 32\nDirectX 9\n700 MB hard disk space\n\nTo properly enjoy the game (based on user input from Game-debate.com):\nPentium 4 3.46GHz/Athlon 64 4000+\nGeForce GT 120/Radeon HD 2600 XT\n2 GB RAM \nWin Xp 32\nDirectX 9\n\nRecommended:\nCore 2 Duo E4400 2.0GHz/Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core 4200+\nGeForce GT 340/Radeon X1900 GT\n2 GB RAM \nWin 7 32\nDirectX 9\n700 MB hard disk space\n\n\n== If you enjoyed the game then share with others by seeding!
