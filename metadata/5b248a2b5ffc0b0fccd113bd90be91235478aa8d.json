The duo reformed in 2000, and released an album of new material in 2004. To date, Tears for Fears have sold over 22 million albums worldwide, including more than 8 million in the U.S\n\n.: Tears For Fears :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img713.imageshack.us/img713/5143/tearsforfears.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img713.imageshack.us/img713/5143/tearsforfears.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Album :.\n\n1983 The Hurting (Remastered &amp; Expaned) @320\n1985 Songs From The Big Chair (Deluxe Edition) @320\n1989 The Seeds of Love (Remastered) @320\n1990 Advice For The Young At Heart (Singles) @320\n1992 Tears Roll Down (Greatest Hits 82-92) @320\n1993 Elemental @320\n1995 Raoul And The Kings Of Spain @320\n1996 Saturnine Martial &amp; Lunatic @320\n2001 The Universal Masters Collection @320\n2001 The Working Hour @320\n2002 The Best Of Remixes @320\n2004 Everybody Loves A Happy Ending @320\n2006 Secret World (Live in Paris 2005) @320\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b248a2b5ffc0b0fccd113bd90be91235478aa8d","amp;dn":"Tears+For+Fears+-+Discography+1983-2006+%5BMp3+320+kbps%5D+TNT+Villa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b248a2b5ffc0b0fccd113bd90be91235478aa8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,36,138,43,95,252,11,15,204,209,19,189,144,190,145,35,84,120,170,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
