Note: An additional delay (approximately one minute) will occur the first time that you start After Effects with a Kepler-class GPU as the new ray-traced 3D library is initialized. Installation of updated display drivers may require this initialization step again.\n * Enabled basic support for the AtomKraft composition renderer (requires plug-ins from Jupiter Jazz).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93b45c83e2a1f937111b33ec7ef5cc895caa84b2","amp;dn":"Adobe+After+Effects+CS6+11.0.1+UPDATER+ONLY+%5BChingLiu%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93b45c83e2a1f937111b33ec7ef5cc895caa84b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,180,92,131,226,161,249,55,17,27,51,236,126,245,204,137,92,170,132,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
