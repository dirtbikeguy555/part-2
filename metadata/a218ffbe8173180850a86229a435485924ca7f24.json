Although it contains a total of 20 tracks, Greatest Hits ultimately fails to improve over its predecessor, for the simple fact that the early '80s was The Pretenders' artistic and commercial peak, and Greatest Hits contains too much latter-day material. Whereas it would have been a wise move to showcase such oft-overlooked classics as &quot;Tattooed Love Boys,&quot; &quot;Mystery Achievement,&quot; &quot;Precious,&quot; &quot;My City Was Gone,&quot; or &quot;Birds of Paradise&quot; (all of which weren't included on The Singles), Greatest Hits includes such not-as-strong selections as &quot;Night in My Veins,&quot; &quot;Breakfast in Bed,&quot; and &quot;Human&quot; instead. Although there are quite a few gems included (&quot;Brass in Pocket,&quot; &quot;Message of Love,&quot; &quot;Talk of the Town,&quot; &quot;Kid,&quot; &quot;Back on the Chain Gang,&quot; etc.), Greatest Hits leaves out far too many prime selections to be considered truly definitive. Also issued at the same time of Greatest Hits was a DVD by the same name that included most of the group's promo video clips.\nAll Music Review by Greg Prato\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Brass In Pocket\n[02] Message Of Love\n[03] Don't Get Me Wrong\n[04] Kid\n[05] Human\n[06] I Go To Sleep\n[07] Forever Young\n[08] I Got You Babe - - - UB40 &amp; Chrissie Hynde\n[09] Night In My Veins\n[10] Spiritual High - - - Moodswings &amp; Chrissie Hynde\n[11] Talk Of The Town\n[12] Stop Your Sobbing\n[13] Hymn To Her\n[14] 2000 Miles\n[15] Breakfast In Bed - - - UB40 &amp; Chrissie Hynde\n[16] Popstar\n[17] Middle Of The Road\n[18] Thin Line Between Love And Hate\n[19] Back On The Chain Gang\n[20] I'll Stand By You\n\nCD Play Time - 01h:13m:26s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 172mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
