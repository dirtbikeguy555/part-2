The original score was composed by Michael Nyman and is his twentieth album release. Despite being \ncalled a &quot;soundtrack&quot;, this is a partial score re-recording, as Nyman himself also performs the piano on the\n album (whereas the film version is performed by lead actress Holly Hunter). The music is performed by the \nMunich Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Nyman with Michael Nyman Band members John Harle, David Roach and\n Andrew Findon performing the prominent saxophone work.\nThe album was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score (but lost to the score of Heaven\n &amp; Earth) and the BAFTA Award for Best Score (lost to the score of Schindler's List).\nThe album design and illustration are by Dave McKean.\n   \n=====================================\n\nTracklist\n\n1. \t&quot;To the Edge of the Earth&quot;   \t4:06\n2. \t&quot;Big My Secret&quot;   \t2:51\n3. \t&quot;A Wild and Distant Shore&quot;   \t5:50\n4. \t&quot;The Heart Asks Pleasure First&quot;   \t1:33\n5. \t&quot;Here to There&quot;   \t1:02\n6. \t&quot;The Promise&quot;   \t4:14\n7. \t&quot;A Bed of Ferns&quot;   \t0:46\n8. \t&quot;The Fling&quot;   \t1:28\n9. \t&quot;The Scent of Love&quot;   \t4:16\n10. \t&quot;Deep into the Forest&quot;   \t2:58\n11. \t&quot;The Mood That Passes Through You&quot;   \t1:13\n12. \t&quot;Lost and Found&quot;   \t2:24\n13. \t&quot;The Embrace&quot;   \t2:36\n14. \t&quot;Little Impulse&quot;   \t2:11\n15. \t&quot;The Sacrifice&quot;   \t2:46\n16. \t&quot;I Clipped Your Wing&quot;   \t4:34\n17. \t&quot;The Wounded&quot;   \t2:26\n18. \t&quot;All Imperfect Things&quot;   \t4:03\n19. \t&quot;Dreams of a Journey&quot;   \t5:30\n   \n========================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 1.11 GB\nAlbum                                    : The Piano\nTrack name/Total                         : 19\nPerformer                                : Members of the Munich Philharmonic Orchestra\nComposer                                 : Michael Nyman / Michael Nyman\nRecorded date                            : 2002\n\n============================================\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                                   : FLAC\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 2 786 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 88.2 KHz\nBit depth                                : 24 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f8f811c508095b4a921dd5652b7f39af3087a49","amp;dn":"Michael+Nyman+-+The+Piano+%282002%29+FLAC+%5BSACD+24%2F88200%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f8f811c508095b4a921dd5652b7f39af3087a49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,143,129,28,80,128,149,180,169,33,221,86,82,183,243,154,243,8,122,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
