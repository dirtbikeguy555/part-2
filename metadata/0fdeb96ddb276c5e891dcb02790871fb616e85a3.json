This book offers solutions and inspirations for these tricky spots that we frequently overlook or neglect, and highlights some unusual growing spaces such as a minuscule balcony in Bristol, an innovative installation of hexagonal polytunnels full of salad leaves in Amiens, France, and an ingenious self-sufficient growing system that provides a wealth of vegetables in an old swimming pool in Phoenix, Arizona","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fdeb96ddb276c5e891dcb02790871fb616e85a3","amp;dn":"My+Tiny+Veg+Plot%3A+Grow+your+own+in+surprisingly+small+spaces+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fdeb96ddb276c5e891dcb02790871fb616e85a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,222,185,109,219,39,108,94,137,29,203,2,121,8,113,251,97,110,133,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
