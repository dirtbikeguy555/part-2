Besides being one of France's most popular and enduring singers, he is also one of the most well-known singers in the world. He is known for his characteristic short figure and unique tenor voice; clear and ringing in its upper reaches, with gravely and profound low notes. He has appeared in more than 60 movies, composed about 1,000 songs (including at least 150 in English, 100 in Italian, 70 in Spanish, and 50 in German, and sold well over 100 million records. His big break came when the singer ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°dith Piaf heard him sing and arranged to take him with her on tour in France and to the United States. In 1998, Charles Aznavour was chosen as Entertainer of the Century by CNN and users of Time Online from around the globe. He was recognized as the century's outstanding performer, with nearly 18% of the total vote, edging out Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan. He has sung for presidents, popes, and royalty, as well as at humanitarian events, and is the founder of the charitable organization Aznavour for Armenia along with his long-time friend\nand impresario Levon Sayan. Aznavour started his global farewell tour in late 2006, which continues through this day. In 2009 he was appointed ambassador of Armenia to Switzerland, as well as Armenia's permanent delegate to the United Nations at Geneva.\n\nWebsite www.c-aznavour.com ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:479d6e417ecb197f2b4829e421bd5e9037427a2c","amp;dn":"Charles++Aznavour+-+Greatest+Hits+and+More","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"479d6e417ecb197f2b4829e421bd5e9037427a2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,157,110,65,126,203,25,127,43,72,41,228,33,189,94,144,55,66,122,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
