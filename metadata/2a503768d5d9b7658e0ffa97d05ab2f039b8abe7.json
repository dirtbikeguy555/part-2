Tragedy strikes when one of the workers is killed by a velociraptor.\nThe founder of the park, John Hammond, Richard Attenborough requests\nPaleontologist Dr. Alan Grant Sam Neil and his assistant, Dr. Ellie Sattler\nLaura Dern to come to the park and ensure that it is safe. Also joining them\nare Hammond's lawyer Donald Gennaro Martin Ferrero and chaos theorist Dr. Ian\nMalcolm Jeff Goldblum. When they reach the island, they are amazed to discover\nthat Hammond has created living dinosaurs. However, at the same time they all\nhave their doubts. Later, Hammond's grandchildren Lex and Tim Ariana Richards\nand Joseph Mazzello join the group in a tour of the park. Sattler leaves the\ntour to take care of an ill triceratops. Soon the power in the park is shut\ndown by computer systems geek Dennis Nedry Wayne Knight who wishes to steal\nembryos from the park to sell to a secret buyer. In the process, many dinosaurs\nescape their paddocks, including the deadly Tyrannosaurus Rex, who, during a\nthunderstorm, escapes his paddock &amp; attacks the children, and eats Gennaro.\nMalcolm is injured &amp; Grant and the children are then lost in the park.\nMeanwhile, Hammond, Sattler and the rest of the operations team learn that\nNedry who in the meantime has been killed has locked up the computer system\nto cover his tracks. They attempt to get power back in the park in order to\nescape the island. After shutting down the system, then restoring it, the\ngroup realizes that velociraptors are also on the loose, &amp; are now on the\nhunt for the visitors.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Sam Neill.\n=&gt;-Laura Dern.\n=&gt;-Jeff Goldblum.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Steven Spielberg.\n\nThe Lost World Jurassic Park.\nIan Malcolm is recruited by John Hammond to lead a research team to Isla Sorna,\nan island 87 miles to the south of Isla Nublar the site of the original Jurassic\nPark. Here, InGen Bioengineering had constructed the secret Site B, where the\ndinosaurs were actually bred and then transported to the park. Hammond's nephew,\nwho has taken control of InGen, leads his own team to the island to capture the\ndinos and bring them back to the U.S. to become attractions at a dino park in\nSan Diego. The dinos cause havoc and have a field day with the movable feast.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Jeff Goldblum.\n=&gt;-Pete Postlethwaite.\n=&gt;-Julianne Moore.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Steven Spielberg.\n\nJurassic Park III.\nAnxious to fund research for his new theory of velociraptor intelligence, renowned\npaleontologist Dr. Alan Grant is persuaded by wealthy adventurer Paul Kirby and\nhis wife Amanda to accompany them on an aerial tour of Isla Sorna. This infamous\nisland, once InGen's site B, has become both a primordial breeding ground for John\nHammond's magnificent creations and a magnet for thrill-seekers eager to encounter\nthem. When a tragic accident maroons the party of seven, Grant discovers the true\nreason his deceptive hosts have invited him along. In their perilous attempt to\nescape, the dwindling group encounters terrifying new creatures undisclosed by\nInGen, and Grant is forced to learn the dreadful implications of his raptor\nintelligence theory firsthand.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Sam Neill.\n=&gt;-Yayan Ruhian.\n=&gt;-William H Macy.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Joe Johnston.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre..........................: Action : Sci-Fi : Adventure.\n=&gt;-Release Date...................: 1993 : 1997 : 2001.\n=&gt;-Language.......................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size......................: 1.16 GiB : 1.18 GiB : 868 MiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...............: 1 317 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..................: 2h 06mn : 2h 08mn : 1h 32mn.\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec..........................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...................: 16:9.\n=&gt;-Resolution.....................: 1280 x 720.\n=&gt;-Bit rate.......................: 1200 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec..........................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels.......................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate.......................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...............: 229 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles\n=&gt;-English.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a503768d5d9b7658e0ffa97d05ab2f039b8abe7","amp;dn":"Jurassic+Park+1%2C+2%2C+3+-+Adventure+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH264-mp4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a503768d5d9b7658e0ffa97d05ab2f039b8abe7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,80,55,104,213,217,183,101,142,15,250,151,208,90,178,240,57,184,171,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
