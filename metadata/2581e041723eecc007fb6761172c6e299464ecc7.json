This book takes the ideas that have turned statistics into a central science in modern life and makes them accessible without compromising necessary rigor. Authors Alan Agresti and Christine Franklin believe that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s important for students to learn and analyze both quantitative and categorical data.  As a result, the text pays greater attention to the analysis of proportions than many other introductory statistics texts.  Concepts are introduced first with categorical data, and then with quantitative data.\n \nThe Third Edition has been edited for conciseness and clarity to keep students focused on the main concepts. The data-rich examples that feature intriguing human-interest topics now include topic labels to indicate which statistical topic is being applied. \n\nISBN-10: 0321755944\nISBN-13:  9780321755940\nPublisher:  Pearson\nCopyright:  2013\nFormat:  PDF(eBook) W/ CD &amp; MINITAB 16 (CRACKED); 832 pp\nPublished:  12/27/2011\nLanguage: English\n\nThis package has the full text from Statistics: The Art &amp; Science of Learning from Data 3/e, Alan Agresti &amp; Christine Franklin.
