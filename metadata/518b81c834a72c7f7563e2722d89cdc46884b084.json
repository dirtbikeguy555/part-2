While both tracks are included here (&quot;Kiss Me&quot;, in fact, shows up twice), other songs culled from the band's archive, as well as contributions from assorted compilations, provide plenty more listening pleasure for Sixpence fans as Leigh Nash's sleepy vocals complement catchy hook-driven melodies in slickly produced studio arrangements. Some of the brighter spots on the record are actually covers of other artists' greatest hits that force Sixpence None The Richer out of their comfort zone and into more intriguing territory, such as on Crowded House's &quot;Don't Dream It's Over&quot; and ABBA's &quot;Dancing Queen&quot;. Three previously unreleased songs are also included.\n\n\nTORRENTED BY:\n\nTorrent Tracts, April 2009\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:518b81c834a72c7f7563e2722d89cdc46884b084","amp;dn":"Sixpence+None+The+Richer+-+2004+-+The+Best+Of","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"518b81c834a72c7f7563e2722d89cdc46884b084","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,139,129,200,52,167,44,127,117,99,226,114,45,137,205,196,104,132,176,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
