It is adapted from a novel by Laszlo Karsznahorkai and reflects the obsession of director Bela Tarr who began the film seven years ago. It took two full years to film this opus. The story is presented through a series of chapters of varying lengths with titles like \\&quot;The News That They are Coming,\\&quot; \\&quot;We, the Resurrected,\\&quot; \\&quot;The Freeze,\\&quot; \\&quot;Only Problems and Work.\\&quot; and finally \\&quot;The Circle Is Completed.\\&quot; The enormously complex saga is centered in an abandoned farm machinery plant upon a Hungarian plain. There live a small band of hobos including three couples, a doctor with a drinking problem. All of them want to leave and they will do anything they can to do it. A set series of events occurs, but the story presents those events from each of the different character\\&amp;#039;s viewpoints.\n-All Movie Guide\n\nCredits for the rip go to HEL.\n\n\n********************************* FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
