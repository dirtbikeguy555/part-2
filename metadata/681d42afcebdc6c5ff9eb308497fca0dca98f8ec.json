Introduction\n---------------\n\nThe package is a combination of the Unlocker code written by Zenith432 plus some\nscripts written by myself that wrap the actual unlocker code. \n\nIt has been tested against:\n\n* Workstation 8/9/10 on Windows and Linux (32 &amp; 64-bit versions)\n* Player 4/5/6 on Windows and Linux (32 &amp; 64-bit versions)\n* Fusion 4/5/6 on Snow Leopard, Lion and Mountain Lion\n* ESXi 5.0/5.1\n\nThe patch code carries out the following modifications dependent on the product\nbeing patched:\n\n* Fix vmware-vmx and derivatives to allow Mac OS X to boot\n* Fix vmwarebase .dll or .so to allow Apple to be selected during creation\n* Copy darwin.iso if needed to VMware folder\n\nNote that not all products recognize the darwin.iso via install tools menu item.\nYou will have to manually mount the darwin.iso for example on Workstation.\n\nAlso Player is missing vmware-vmx-debug and vmware-vmx-stats files and so an \nerror is shown during patching as the files are not found. This can be safely \nignored.\n\nThe vmwarebase code does not need to be patched on ESXi or OS X so you will see a \nmessage on those systems telling you that it will not be patched.\n\nIn all cases make sure VMware is not running, and any background guests have \nbeen shutdown.\n\n2. Windows\n----------\nOn Windows you will need to either run cmd.exe as Administrator or using \nExplorer right click on the command file and select &quot;Run as administrator&quot;.\n\ninstall.cmd   - patches VMware and copies darwin.iso tools image to VMware\nuninstall.cmd - restores VMware and removes darwin.iso tools image from VMware\n\n3. Linux\n---------\nOn Linux you will need to be either root or use sudo to run the scripts. \n\nYou may need to ensure the contents of the Linux folder have execute permissions\nby running chmod +x against the 4 files.\n\ninstall.sh   - patches VMware and copies darwin.iso tools image to VMware\nuninstall.sh - restores VMware and removes darwin.iso tools image from VMware\n\n4. Mac OS X\n-----------\nOn Mac OS X you will need to be either root or use sudo to run the scripts. \nThis is really only needed if you want to use client versions of Mac OS X.\n\nYou may need to ensure the contents of the OSX folder have execute permissions\nby running chmod +x against the 3 files.\n\ninstall.sh   - patches VMware \nuninstall.sh - restores VMware \n\n5. ESXi\n-------\nESXi has to be patched using the scripts, as the unlocker is used to overlay \nthe ESXi firmware at runtime. You will need to transfer the files to the \nESXi host either using vSphere client or SCP.\n\nOnce uploaded you will need to either use the ESXi support console or use SSH to\nrun the commands. Please note that you will need to reboot the host for the \npatches to become active.\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt; WARNING: use a datastore volume to run the scripts &gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nYou may need to ensure the contents of the esxi folder have execute permissions\nby running chmod +x against the 3 files.\n\ninstall.sh   - patches VMware \nuninstall.sh - restores VMware \n\n6. Zenith432's Unlocker\n-----------------------\n\nIn all cases the unlocker can be run without the scripts but you would need to\ncarry out additional actions which the scripts encapsulate for you especially on\nESXi. If you want to run the unlocker directly the parameters are:\n\nUsage: ./Unlocker.Linux64 [-h] [-u] [target_directory]\n  -h: print help\n  -u: remove the patch\n  target_directory: customize location of vmx executables\n\nOn all platforms you must run it with administrator or root privileges.\nThe source code is provided and Zenith432 makes it freely available for\nmodification. I have modified the code and it is available as per Zenith432's \noriginal statement.\n\n\nThanks to Zenith432 for building the unlocker and Mac Son of Knife for all\nthe testing and support.\n\n\nHistory\n-------\n11/10/11 1.0.0 - First release \n07/11/11 1.0.1 - Fixed typo in Windows command files\n07/12/11 1.0.2 - Updated patcher and tools for latest release WKS 8.0.1 &amp; FUS 4.1.1\n10/05/12 1.1.0 - Changed the patching mechanism for vmwarebase .dll or .so\n                 &amp; tested against ESXi 5.0 U1 and Tech Previews.\n13/07/13 1.1.1 - Changed ESXi scripts to ensure not deleting root /bin folder\n               - Fixed vmwarebase patching on 32-bit Linux\n               - Some other code clean-up in Unlocker.cpp\n18/09/13 1.2.0 - Updated pattern matching for WKS 10.0.0 &amp; FUS 6.0.0\n\n(c) 2011-2013 Dave Parsons\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:681d42afcebdc6c5ff9eb308497fca0dca98f8ec","amp;dn":"vmware+unlocker+v+1.2.0+for+Workstation+8%2C9%2C10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"681d42afcebdc6c5ff9eb308497fca0dca98f8ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,29,66,175,206,189,198,197,255,158,179,8,73,127,202,13,202,152,248,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
