Winner of the Gold Crown Award &quot;Best Screenplay&quot; 2001. About a dishonest used car salesman who turns himself around. \n\nThe story is about a used car dealer who fits the cliches about that line of work just perfectly. Then one day his conscience starts to nudge him toward a more honest life. He turns his business over to God, and says that since it belongs to Him, He's now responsible for how his new honest approach turns out. \n\nRuntime: 119 min\nLanguage: English (No-Subtitles)\nYear: 2005\nMy Rating: 9/10\nQuality: 6.0/10 \n\nIf financially possible, please buy this CD/DVD to keep Christian films in business. If Christians won't buy Christian films then who will?\n\nPlease seed. Let each one of us who call ourself Christians seed 2-3 movies each. So that these movies may become a blessing to all those who are hungry for God's word &amp; grace. May Jesus bless all those who are seeding the christian torrents.\n\nPS: If you need any specific christian movie or have something to say then kindly send a mail to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;660f08020f0708050e140f15120f07085456565f261f070e0909480509480f08&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&quot;Don't ask me what Christ can do for you! \nHe has done all he could. \nTell me what you can do for Christ?&quot;\n\nUploaded by Indian Christian\t\t\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7a4d9fc6d9a731595da9e3735c73ace5d0b4857","amp;dn":"Flywheel+%28Christian+Movie%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7a4d9fc6d9a731595da9e3735c73ace5d0b4857","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,164,217,252,109,154,115,21,149,218,158,55,53,199,58,206,93,11,72,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
