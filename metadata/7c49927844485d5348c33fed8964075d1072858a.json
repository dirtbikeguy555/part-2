Translated by Henry Bettenson, with an Introduction by John O'Meara.\n\nISBN: 9780140448948 | 1184 pages | EPUB + MOBI\n\n\nST. AUGUSTINE (354-430), bishop of Hippo, is one of the central figures in the history of Christianity, and THE CITY OF GOD is one of his greatest theological works.  Written as an eloquent defence of the faith at a time when the Roman Empire was on the brink of collapse, it examines the ancient pagan religions of Rome, the arguments of the Greek philosophers and the revelations of the Bible.  Pointing the way forward to a citizenship that transcends worldly politics and will last for eternity, the book represents a dramatic turning point in the unfolding of Christian doctrine.\n\nThe new introduction by John O'Meara examines the text in the light of contemporary Greek and Roman thought and political change.  It demonstrates the importance of religious and literary influences on St. Augustine and his significance as a Christian thinker.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c49927844485d5348c33fed8964075d1072858a","amp;dn":"St.+Augustine+-+The+City+of+God+%28Penguin+Classics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c49927844485d5348c33fed8964075d1072858a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,73,146,120,68,72,93,83,72,195,63,237,137,100,7,93,16,114,133,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
