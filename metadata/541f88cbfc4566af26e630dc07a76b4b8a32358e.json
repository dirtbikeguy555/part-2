Create ideas, make changes without stopping, and capture everything as you work.\n\nIf youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve used music software before, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re already familiar with one half of Ableton Live. LiveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Arrangement View is a familiar working space: time moves from left to right, while tracks are stacked vertically.\n\nBut Live also features the revolutionary Session View: a unique sketchpad for improvising, playing and performing with musical ideas, without the constraints of the timeline. Freely and independently start and stop any number of audio or MIDI loops - everything stays in sync. Almost everything in Live works in real-time - add, reorder or remove devices, play with LiveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flexible track routing and more - all without interrupting your creative flow.\n\n\n\n                  9.1.1 Release Notes\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://www.ableton.com/en/articles/live-9-release-notes/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://www.ableton.com/en/articles/live-9-release-notes/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n                      Main Features:\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Max for Live: Inspiring synths, effects and customizations to Live itself,as well as a toolkit for building your own.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Complex warp modes&quot; Advanced algorithms for stretching audio, ideal forworking with mixed audio or full tracks\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Audio slicing: Slice audio to a Drum Rack or Sampler instance\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Audio to MIDI: Extract harmony, melody or drums from an audio sample andconvert it to MIDI\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ REX File support: Support for ReCycle/Reason audio files\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ POW-r dithering: Mastering quality dithering modes for downsamplingaudio\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Video import/export: Import video as a clip and save modified video andaudio\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Serato Scratch Live integration: The Bridge - DJ in Serato Scratch Livewith a synced Ableton Live set.
