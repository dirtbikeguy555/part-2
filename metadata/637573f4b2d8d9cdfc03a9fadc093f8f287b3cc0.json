Just like the original vinyl box set &quot;The Single File&quot;, released back in 1984, this is a collection bringing together all of her UK singles to date, coupled with their respective B-sides, non-album tracks and remixes. Completed with a few essential non-UK A- and B-sides like &quot;Them Heavy People&quot; (studio version, Japan 1978), &quot;Symphony in Blue&quot; (Japan &amp; Canada, 1978), &quot;Suspended in Gaffa&quot; (Continental Europe &amp; Scandinavia, 1983), &quot;Ne t'enfuis pas&quot;/&quot;Un baiser d'enfant&quot; (France &amp; Canada, 1983) and &quot;Night of the Swallow&quot;/&quot;Houdini&quot; (Ireland, 1983). \n\nNinety moments of sheer pleasure and since the vast majority of these recordings are long out of print and otherwise unobtainable  - take note EMI and Novercia/Noble &amp; Brite Ltd. - in my humble opinion also a box set begging to be released...\n\n\nTRACK LIST\n==========\n*  Non-album version\n** Non-album track\n\n01.
