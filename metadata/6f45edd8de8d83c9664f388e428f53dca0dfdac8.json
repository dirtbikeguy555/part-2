Vektor quickly forged a formidable name for themselves among the Phoenix metal contingent for their unique mix of technical, speed thrash and progressive influences. Going against the grain of the Phoenix metal scene, Vektor created a wave of interest with their self released demo, Demolition (2006), and the ferocious two track demo Hunger for Violence (2007). After four years of local and regional gigging opening for such national acts as Testament, Hirax, Iced Earth and Municpal Waste, Vektor hit the road for their first national tour alongside label mates Exmortus in support of their debut album, Black Future.\r\n\r\nThrash\r\nSubgenre:\tTechnical Death / Progressive / Thrash Metal\r\n\r\nBitrate/Format: mp3\t320ak\r\n\r\nSize:\t169.30 MB\r\n\t\r\n10 files\r\n\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01.
