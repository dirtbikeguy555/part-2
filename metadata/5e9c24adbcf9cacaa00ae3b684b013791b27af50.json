Watch this and the other version, &quot;Turn to the Dark Side&quot;, and let us know which is better.  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10123363/Star_Wars_-_Turn_to_the_Dark_Side&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10123363/Star_Wars_-_Turn_to_the_Dark_Side&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIn 2012, actor Topher Grace showed an edit he'd done of episodes I-III of Star Wars to a bunch of friends, trimming the 7 hours of prequels down into 85 action-packed minutes of pure story. This edit is longer (2:47) and is &quot;based on the structure conceived by actor Topher Grace&quot;, which you can read about here.\n\nGrace's version of the film(s) centers on Anakin's training and friendship with Obi-Wan, and his relationship with Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman). Gone are Trade Federation blockades, the Gungan city, the whole PadmÃƒÂ© handmaiden storyline, the explanation of midichlorians, the galactic senate and the boring politics, Anakin's origins (a backstory which never really needed to be seen in the first place), the droid army's attack on Naboo, and Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best) appears only briefly for only one line of dialogue, used as a set-up to introduce us to the Queen.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nRuntime: 129 min\nVideoow: 960*540 (including black bars) @ 948 kbps\nAudioow: English AAC 2.0 @ 160 kbps\n\nScreenshots: &lt;a href=&quot; http://someimage.com/n1kE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://someimage.com/n1kE&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/GoodFilms&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/GoodFilms&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e9c24adbcf9cacaa00ae3b684b013791b27af50","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+-+A+Last+Hope+-+Episodes+1-3+recut%2C+improved","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e9c24adbcf9cacaa00ae3b684b013791b27af50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,156,36,173,188,249,202,202,160,10,227,182,132,176,19,121,27,39,175,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
