Full               \n          Descriptionmusic, this 2000 release stands as the final word on the Ozark Mountain   \n          Daredevils' career. Cherry-picking 21 tunes from their five studio album stint circa \n          1974-1978 -- with the lion's share coming from their first three albums and only     \n          three selections from the final two -- this is pretty much all you'll need from the  \n          under-recognized band that worked in the '70s country-rock shadows of Poco and       \n          Firefall, but weren't as dependable or pop savvy as either. In fact, their biggest   \n          hit, the Hall &amp; Oates, blue-eyed soul-styled &quot;Jackie Blue,&quot; was so atypical of the   \n          band's characteristically down-home approach that it ultimately may have been more   \n          damaging to their career than if they had clicked with a song more representative of \n          their crisp, rural country pop/rock. As enjoyable and pleasantly organic as they     \n          were, the group lacked a distinctive vocalist, direction, and most importantly great \n          songs. This collection focuses on their less commercially rocking, more rootsy side, \n          and as such it's a consistently listenable, predominantly chronological compilation  \n          that is all any but the most die-hard fan will ever need. An extensive essay         \n          (including quotes from bandmembers) and rare photos in the disc's 16-page booklet    \n          sweeten the pot and make this as definitive an overview from a talented also-ran     \n          outfit as necessary. Like its closing title track, the Ozark Mountain Daredevils     \n          lived in a stylistic time warp, comfortable within its own limitations and unwilling \n          -- but not unable -- to break free of them. ~ Hal Horowitz                           \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n                 Album opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,            \n                 HHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality         \n                 of the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!                  \n                                                                                               \n                                                                                               \n               Track Listing....:                                                              \n                 01.If you wanna get to heaven  [03:05]                                        \n                 02.Jackie blue                 [04:11]                                        \n                 03.Country girl                [03:14]                                        \n                 04.Chicken train               [03:37]                                        \n                 05.Spaceship orion             [03:08]                                        \n                 06.Standing on the rock        [03:54]                                        \n                 07.Road to glory               [04:51]                                        \n                 08.You made it right           [03:45]                                        \n                 09.Look away                   [03:34]                                        \n                 10.E.E. lawson                 [03:32]                                        \n                 11.It probably always will     [03:13]                                        \n                 12.Walkin' down the road       [03:26]                                        \n                 13.It'll shine when it shines  [03:40]                                        \n                 14.Keep on churnin'            [02:54]                                        \n                 15.Leatherwood                 [04:01]                                        \n                 16.Cobblestone mountain        [02:24]                                        \n                 17.Mr. powell                  [03:13]                                        \n                 18.Homemade wine               [02:38]                                        \n                 19.Arroyo                      [05:07]                                        \n                 20.Giving it all to the wind   [04:15]                                        \n                 21.Time warp                   [04:08]                                        \n                                                       ____                                    \n                                                                                               \n                                               75:50 min                                       \n                                               116,7 MB                                        \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:071c53a13e4ca366bef32a460fb68db7bcf934c3","amp;dn":"The_Ozark_Mountain_Daredevils-Time_Warp_The_Very_Best_Of-%28Retail","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"071c53a13e4ca366bef32a460fb68db7bcf934c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,28,83,161,62,76,163,102,190,243,42,70,15,182,141,183,188,249,52,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
