It's great.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut when I'm using my old pc, I prefer to use Piano One\n\r\n&quot;Piano One utilizes only 150MB, which is quite a small footprint, making Piano One usable even on older PCs. There is no waiting time when loading and the CPU usage is so small that it's virtually unnoticeable.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I have to record, my choice is this piano, the 1969 Steinway Grand Piano. It sounds really great.\r\n\r\nIt has different settings, which includes:\r\n\r\nDefault (the normal piano)\r\nStaccato\r\nReversed\r\nGlisten\r\nInfinity (a setting I tend to use a lot, since it can be used like a Piano + Synth setup)\r\nEthereal\r\nGlockiano\r\nSuppressiano\r\nEmperor\r\nGolden\r\nThe Future\r\n\r\nYou can use it also with a pedal, to sustain the keys you touch.\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nOverview\r\n\r\n    Price: $149\r\n    Deep-Sampled 1969 Steinway Concert (D) Grand\r\n    6 Microphone Positions\r\n    5.0GB / 9.272 Samples\r\n    Direct download / Cloud Server System\r\n    Product only available as download\r\n\r\nCore Specifications\r\n\r\n    Deep-Sampled 1969 Steinway Concert (D) Grand\r\n    6 Microphone Perspectives (Overhead, Keyboard/Player, Damper, Spot, Ambient &amp; Room)\r\n    Unique Staccato Samples with Round Robin\r\n    12 Additional Piano Morph Patches\r\n    Advanced Controls (ex.
