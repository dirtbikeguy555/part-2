But his carefree style doesn't impress everyone, including Tia (Jean Kelly), his rebellious teenage niece, and Chanice (Amy Madigan), his impatient girlfriend.\n\nUncle Buck is the last person you'd think of to watch the kids. But with a little luck and a lot of love, he manages to surprise everyone in this heartwarming family comedy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0e06a9928c9d25b8f5908592bc446ebe0ff11de","amp;dn":"Uncle+Buck+%281989.DVDRip.XviD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0e06a9928c9d25b8f5908592bc446ebe0ff11de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,224,106,153,40,201,210,91,143,89,8,89,43,196,70,235,224,255,17,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
