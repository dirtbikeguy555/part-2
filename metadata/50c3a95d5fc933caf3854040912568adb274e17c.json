Read it too if you fear that this goal is out of reach Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you may be surprised! Laurence Viennot here shows ways to deal with the awkward fact that common sense thinking is often not the same as scientific thinking. She analyses examples of frequent and widespread errors and confusions, which provide a real eye-opener for the teacher. More than that, she shows ways to avoid and overcome them. The book argues against over-emphasis on Ã¢â‚¬Å“funÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ applications, demonstrating that students also enjoy and value clear thinking.\n\nThe book has three parts:\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ making sense of special scientific ways of reasoning (words, images, functions)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ making connections between very different topics, each illuminating the other\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ simplifying, looking for consistency and avoiding incoherent over-simplification\nThe book is enhanced with supplementary online materials that will allow readers to further expand their teaching or research interests and think about them more deeply.\n\nIt offers a magnificent supply of insight and ideas, all of which can be put to use no matter what physics programme you teach. The examples provided in this book shed light on the processes of teaching and popularization of physics, from the high school to the early undergraduate level\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.esera2013.org.cy/cache/cfx_imagecr3/6D7CB3896FDC9E854F3C8B9412E072A7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.esera2013.org.cy/cache/cfx_imagecr3/6D7CB3896FDC9E854F3C8B9412E072A7.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nLaurence Viennot is emeritus professor at the UniversitÃƒÂ© Denis Diderot (Paris 7) and contributed to the creation of the LDPES (Laboratoire de Didactique de la Physique dans l'Enseignement SupÃƒÂ©rieur) laboratory, now part of the Laboratoire AndrÃƒÂ© Revuz.
