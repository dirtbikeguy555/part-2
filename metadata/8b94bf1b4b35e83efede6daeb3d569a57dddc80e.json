But using the wrong framework, or wrongly using the right framework, can be costly. This concise book shares higher-level ideas around web development frameworks that govern HTML and CSS code, whether youâ€™re looking at an external option or planning to build your own. Author Jens Meiert outlines various principles, methods, and practices that you can use to make sure your framework has the functionality you need without bloated code to slow you down.\r\n\r\nThe Little Book of HTML/CSS Frameworks\r\nEnglish | 2015 | ISBN: 1491920165 | 64 Pages | PDF/MOBI/ePUB | 2.10 MB/27.09 MB/16.72 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b94bf1b4b35e83efede6daeb3d569a57dddc80e","amp;dn":"The+Little+Book+of+HTML%2FCSS+Frameworks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b94bf1b4b35e83efede6daeb3d569a57dddc80e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,148,191,27,75,53,232,62,254,222,109,174,179,213,105,165,125,221,200,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
