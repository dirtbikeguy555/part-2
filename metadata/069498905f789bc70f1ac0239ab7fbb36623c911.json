This two-disc set includes more than three hours of music. Disc One features the 14 songs that were aired by HBO in 2001, while Disc Two adds another 11 tunes released here for the first time. The Boss and his band are in top form; their sheer exuberance at playing together, not to mention the joy and inspiration they provide their audience, are palpable, thanks in no small part to the excellent direction and superb sound (Dolby Digital 5.1 or PCM stereo). Highlights? Almost everything, from timeless anthems like &quot;Born to Run&quot; and &quot;Thunder Road&quot; to the riveting &quot;American Skin (41 Shots)&quot; and a bluesy, solo &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; All together now: Bruuuuuuce! --Sam Graham\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TP0RDYPRL._SL500_SS500_.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TP0RDYPRL._SL500_SS500_.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nTracklist P.1\n\n1.
