Jett's brand of rock &amp; roll is loud and stripped-down, yet with overpowering hooks -- a combination of the Stones' tough, sinewy image and beat, AC/DC chords, and glam rock hooks. As the numerous covers she has recorded show, she adheres both to rock tradition and breaks with it -- she plays classic three-chord rock &amp; roll, yet she also loves the trashy elements (in particular, Gary Glitter) of it as well, and she plays with a defiant sneer. From her first band, the Runaways, through her hit-making days in the '80s with the Blackhearts right until her unexpected revival in the '90s, she hasn't changed her music, yet she's kept her quality control high, making one classic single (&quot;I Love Rock 'n Roll&quot;) along the way.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n01.Cherry Bomb\n02.You Drive Me Wild\n03.School Days\n04.Love Is Pain\n05.Bad Reputation\n06.You Don't Know What You've Got\n07.I Want You\n08.I Love Rock N' Roll\n09.(I'm Gonna) Run Away\n10.Crimson And Clover\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n\n01.Do You Wanna Touch Me (Oh Yeah)\n02.The French Song\n03.Everyday People\n04.Fake Friends\n05.Light Of Day\n06.I Hate Myself For Loving You\n07.Backlash\n08.Activity Grrrl\n09.Love Is All Around\n10.Androgynous\n11.A.C.D.C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76dbf26c526885bd1788a5b0a9ed56355141a0f5","amp;dn":"Joan+Jett+And+The+Blackhearts+-+Greatest+Hits+2CD++%282010%29+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76dbf26c526885bd1788a5b0a9ed56355141a0f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,219,242,108,82,104,133,189,23,136,165,176,169,237,86,53,81,65,160,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
