The memory-filled space becomes a revelatory world for housewife and volunteer Jenjira, as she watches over Itt, a handsome soldier with no family visitors. Jen befriends young medium Keng who uses her psychic powers to help loved ones communicate with the comatose men. Doctors explore ways, including coloured light therapy, to ease the mensâ€™ troubled dreams. Jen discovers Ittâ€™s cryptic notebook of strange writings and blueprint sketches. There may be a connection between the soldiersâ€™ enigmatic syndrome and the mythic ancient site that lies beneath the clinic. Magic, healing, romance and dreams are all part of Jenâ€™s tender path to a deeper awareness of herself and the world around her.\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage: Thai\r\n\r\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11b704d6c235a08fafd8def4c45607dc7c39de1c","amp;dn":"Cemetery+of+Splendour+2015+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11b704d6c235a08fafd8def4c45607dc7c39de1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,183,4,214,194,53,160,143,175,216,222,244,196,86,7,220,124,57,222,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
