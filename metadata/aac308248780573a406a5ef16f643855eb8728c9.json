In a civilized world, a roof\nover your head is as essential as food, clothing, energy, and water. Real estate\ninvestors are essential to keeping this vital human need available at a reasonable\nprice. In countries where investing in real estate is limited or excessively controlled\nby the government, such as it was in former Communist Bloc countries,\npeople suffer, and real estate deteriorates.\nSecond, there are many different ways a person can participate and prosper\nwith real estate. For most people, their only real estate investment is where they\nlive. Their home is their biggest investment. During the real estate boom from\n2000 to 2007, many amateurs got involved with flipping housesÃ¢â‚¬â€buying low\nand hoping to sell higher. As you know, many flippers flopped and lost everything.\nIn true investor vocabulary, flipping is known as speculating or trading.\nSome people call it gambling. While flipping is one method of investing, there\nare many, more sophisticated, less risky ways to do well with real estate. This\nbook is filled with the knowledge and experiences of real, real estate investorsÃ¢â‚¬â€\nreal estate professionals who invest rather than flip, speculate, trade, or gamble.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aac308248780573a406a5ef16f643855eb8728c9","amp;dn":"the+real+book+of+real+estate++robert+kiyosaki","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aac308248780573a406a5ef16f643855eb8728c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,195,8,36,135,128,87,58,64,106,94,241,111,100,56,85,235,135,40,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
