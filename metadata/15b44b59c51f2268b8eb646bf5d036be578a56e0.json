These hands-on video lessons cover hardening network devices with Cisco Configuration Professional (CCP), implementing secure management and monitoring, using ACS and TACACS+, implementing layer 2 protection for switches, packet filtering ACLs, configuring Cisco IOS zone-based firewalls and Cisco ASA firewalls, adding IPS to Cisco routers, connecting IPsec site to site VPN tunnels on Cisco routers, and implementing SSL VPNs on the Cisco ASA. Through this collection of 10 video training lessons, divided into 29 sublessons, you will gain insight into the hands-on configuration and troubleshooting skills needed to develop a security infrastructure, recognize threats and vulnerabilities to networks, and mitigate security threats. \n\nSkill Level: Beginner\n\nWhat You Will Learn\n\n    Harden network devices with CCP\n    Implement secure management and monitoring\n    Use a central ACS with TACACS+\n    Implement Layer 2 protection for switches\n    Reduce risk with ACL packet filtering\n    Deploy IOS Zone-Based Firewalls and Cisco ASA firewalls\n    Add IPS to Cisco routers\n    Implement IPsec site-to-site and SSL VPNs\n\nTable of Contents\n=======================\n\nLesson 1: Hardening Cisco IOS Network Devices\nLesson 1.1: Initializing a Router to Allow Cisco Configuration Professional (CCP) to Connect and Manage the Router\nLesson 1.2: Defining Communities in CCP and Importing the Configuration from a Router\nLesson 1.3: Using the CCP Security Audit\n\nLesson 2: Implementing Secure Management and Monitoring\nLesson 2.1: Configuring Network Time Protocol (NTP)\nLesson 2.2: Configuring Syslog Destinations\nLesson 2.3: Creating Users in the Local Database (running-config)\nLesson 2.4: Enabling AAA Services\nLesson 2.5: Creating and Assigning Parser Views for Role Based Access Control (RBAC)\n\nLesson 3: Central Access Control Server (ACS)\nLesson 3.1: Configuring a Router to use TACACS+ with Cisco Access Control Server (ACS)\nLesson 3.2: Configuring Device Groups and Identity Groups Within ACS\nLesson 3.3: Configuring Authorization Policies in ACS\nLesson 3.4: Verifying the Results of ACS Authentication and Authorization at the Router\n\nLesson 4: Implementing Layer 2 Protection for Switches\nLesson 4.1: Protecting Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) with BPDU Guard\nLesson 4.2: Mitigating CAM Table Overflows Attacks Using Port Security\n\nLesson 5: Packet Filtering with Access Control Lists (ACL)\nLesson 5.1: Filtering IPv4 Packets on the Router Using Access Control Lists (ACL)\nLesson 5.2: Using Object Groups to Simplify ACL Management\nLesson 5.3: Filtering IPv6 Traffic\n\nLesson 6: Cisco IOS Zone Based Firewall (ZBF)\nLesson 6.1: Using CCP to Implement a Zone-Based Firewall (ZBF) on an IOS Router\nLesson 6.2: Using CCP to Modify and Verify the ZBF Components\n\nLesson 7: Cisco ASA Firewall\nLesson 7.1: Initializing a 5505 ASA Firewall\nLesson 7.2: Using ASDM to Configure the Firewall\nLesson 7.3: Configuring NAT on the ASA\nLesson 7.4: Implementing and Verifying Policy on the ASA\n\nLesson 8: IOS-Based Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)\nLesson 8.1: Installing the IOS-Based Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)\nLesson 8.2: Configuring and Verifying IOS-Based IPS\n\nLesson 9: IPsec VPN Site-to-Site Tunnels\nLesson 9.1: Using CCP to Create IPsec Site-to-Site Virtual Private Network (VPN) Tunnels\nLesson 9.2: Testing and Verifying IPsec Site-to-Site VPN Tunnels\n\nLesson 10: Implementing SSL VPNs on the Cisco ASA Firewall\nLesson 10.1: Using ASDM to Create the AnyConnect SSL VPN Service\nLesson 10.2: Using ASDM to Clientless SSL VPN Service","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15b44b59c51f2268b8eb646bf5d036be578a56e0","amp;dn":"CCNA+Security+640-554+LiveLessons+%28Video+Training%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15b44b59c51f2268b8eb646bf5d036be578a56e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,180,75,89,197,31,34,104,184,235,100,107,245,208,54,190,87,138,86,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
