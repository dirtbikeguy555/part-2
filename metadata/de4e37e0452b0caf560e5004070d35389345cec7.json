Flash was born Joseph Saddler in Barbados on January 1, 1958; he began spinning records as teen growing up in the Bronx, performing live at area dances and block parties. By age 19, while attending technical school courses in electronics during the day, he was also spinning on the local disco circuit; over time, he developed a series of groundbreaking techniques including &quot;cutting&quot; (moving between tracks exactly on the beat), &quot;back-spinning&quot; (manually turning records to repeat brief snippets of sound), and &quot;phasing&quot; (manipulating turntable speeds) -- in short, creating the basic vocabulary which DJs continue to follow even today. \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRap &amp; Hip-Hop\t\t\nLabel:\t\t\tSequel\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.White Lines\n02.Step Off\n03.Pump Me Up\n05.Beat Street\n06.Vice\n07.Freedom\n08.Birthday Party\n09.Flash To The Beat\n10.It's Nasty\n11.The Message\n12.Scorpio\n13.Message II (Survival)\n14.New York, New York\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de4e37e0452b0caf560e5004070d35389345cec7","amp;dn":"Grandmaster+Flash+%26+The+Furious+Five+-+Greatest+Hits+%281992%29+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de4e37e0452b0caf560e5004070d35389345cec7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,78,55,224,69,43,12,175,86,14,80,4,7,13,53,56,147,69,206,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
