LockhartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s novel, We Were Liars, is clever, alluring, and wildly addictive. Each summer the wealthy, seemingly perfect, members of the Sinclair family gather on their private island. We Were Liars is the story of those annual reunions; in particular what happened during a summer that protagonist Cadence is unable to remember. Prejudice, greed, and shifting patriarchal favoritism among the three adult sisters contrasts with the camaraderie and worldview of the teenage cousins and their dear friend Gat. Lazy days of sticky lemonades on the roof and marathon Scrabble games give way to twisty suspense, true love, and good intentions gone horribly wrong. We Were Liars is a story that begs to be read in one sitting. --Seira Wilson","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f0b1bed4f34636a446c2011e843a6349107b467","amp;dn":"We+Were+Liars+-+E.+Lockhart","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f0b1bed4f34636a446c2011e843a6349107b467","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,11,27,237,79,52,99,106,68,108,32,17,232,67,166,52,145,7,180,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
