But the 11 bullets found in the bodies, together with the 5 remaining bullets in the assassins&amp;#039; magazine clip, amount to 16 bullets for a gun that should normally hold 15 bullets. The investigating Swiss/Swedish team from the neutral countries overseeing the DMZ suspects that another, unknown party was involved - all of which points to some sort of cover up. The truth is much simpler and much more tragic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse VLC to view this movie (with subs): http://www.videolan.org\n\nLiked this?
