This includes an introduction to distributed computing, Hadoop, and MapReduce fundamentals and the latest features released with Hive 0.11\n\nFrom developer to analyst, this course tackles a few big questions about big data: Why does this technology exist and why do I need it? How can I get the best out of it utilizing something familiar like SQL and how does this all fit together in an ever-evolving eco-system? This course will introduce the concepts of distributed computing, Hadoop and MapReduce and then goes into great detail into Apache Hive which is an SQL-like query language that can be used with Hadoop and NoSQL databases like HBase and Cassandra. The course presents some challenges you might experience solving real production problems and how Hive makes that task easier to accomplish.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fe2719852d63ec7e1f9eeaab882ec025e509d2a","amp;dn":"Pluralsight+-+SQL+on+Hadoop+-+Analyzing+Big+Data+with+Hive+Tutor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fe2719852d63ec7e1f9eeaab882ec025e509d2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,226,113,152,82,214,62,199,225,249,238,170,184,130,236,2,94,80,157,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
