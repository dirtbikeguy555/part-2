One More for the Fans, due July 24 as a two-CD/DVD set, was recorded last November at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta.\n\nThe title works as a sequel to Lynyrd SkynyrdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s famous 1976 live album One More From the Road, which was also recorded at the Fox Theatre. Among the highlights this time is a special rendition of Ã¢â‚¬Å“TravelinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that pairs current frontman Johnny Van Zant with his late brother, Lynyrd Skynyrd founding singer Ronnie, through archival video. Their sibling Donnie Van Zant, of .38 Special, also appears. Lynyrd Skynyrd are joined for a rousing finale of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sweet Home AlabamaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by all of the guests.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Hearing all of these incredible musicians sing our songs was unforgettable,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ founding guitarist Gary Rossington says in a press release announcing the set. Ã¢â‚¬Å“It was a really special night and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m so happy our fans will now get to enjoy the show at home.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ A complete track listing, with featured artists, is below.\n\nLynyrd Skynyrd will be back on the road later this month, with dates through the summer. They also have a return visit planned for CMT Crossroads, this time for a collaborative show with Brantley Gilbert. One More for the Fans will also make its television debut on July 19 via AXS.\n\nLynyrd SkynyrdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœOne More for the FansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Track Listing\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Whiskey Rock a RollerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Randy Houser)\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“You Got That RightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Robert Randolph and Jimmy Hall)\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Saturday Night SpecialÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Aaron Lewis)\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“WorkinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ for MCAÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Blackberry Smoke)\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Ask Me No QuestionsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (O.A.R.)\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Gimme Back My BulletsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Cheap Trick)\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Ballad of Curtis LoewÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (moe. and John Hiatt)\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Simple ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (GovÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Mule)\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“That SmellÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Warren Haynes)\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Four Walls of RaifordÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Jamey Johnson)\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I Know a LittleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Jason Isbell)\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Call Me the BreezeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Peter Frampton)\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Your NameÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Trace Adkins)\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Down South JukinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Charlie Daniels and Donnie Van Zant)\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Gimme Three StepsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Alabama)\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“TuesdayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s GoneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Gregg Allman)\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“TravelinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ ManÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Lynyrd Skynyrd)\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Free BirdÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Lynyrd Skynyrd)\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Sweet Home AlabamaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Lynyrd Skynyrd and guests)\n\n\nThis two CD/DVD package captures that night, thankfully without the long waits that plagued the show. Musicians both logical (Trace Adkins, Blackberry Smoke, GovÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Mule/Warren Haynes) and less so (Peter Frampton, John Hiatt, Cheap Trick) hit the stage, many in front of a solid backing conglomeration led by Don Was (no stranger to helming high profile tributes) to churn out 16 Skynyrd nuggets. All the front menÃ¢â‚¬â€œ and except for backing vocalists this is not surprisingly an all-boys outingÃ¢â‚¬â€œ are inspired, in good spirits, perform the songs professionally and capture the musicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s basics. But it becomes clear that with Skynyrd, the sum was greater than the parts. While these versions are perfectly acceptable, only a few rise to the challenge of paying respect to the tunes and finding nuances, a distinctive slant and most frustratingly the almost impossible to nail rowdy/rebellious groove of the original band","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8acb7ae22eb0caf4cd8831def908caab82d24609","amp;dn":"Lynyrd+Skynyrd+-+One+More+For+The+Fans+%282015%29+avi+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8acb7ae22eb0caf4cd8831def908caab82d24609","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,203,122,226,46,176,202,244,205,136,49,222,249,8,202,171,130,210,70,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
