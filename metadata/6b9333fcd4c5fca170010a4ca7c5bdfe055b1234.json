In an attempt to broker peace Chyka asks Andrea, Lydia and Gina homewares shopping, which doesn't go to plan. Chyka then hosts an elaborate pooch party for the girls and their fur-children (is it a sign that Janet's small dogs are too scared to leave their Louis Vuitton carrier?). Jackie and Ben show business mentor Chyka the labels on their new cocktail line - while stressing over what else needs doing to get it ready for the big launch. At a glamorous Emirates cocktail party Lydia questions Janet about something Gina divulged in a phone call. Keen to get to the bottom of it, Janet meets Gina for a drink and things quickly turn sour. Will their friendship survive?\nIf you see &quot;Hector&quot; on the end of a file it means I capped it.\nEnjoy, Gaz/Hector :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b9333fcd4c5fca170010a4ca7c5bdfe055b1234","amp;dn":"Real.Housewives.of.Melbourne.s01e09.PDTV.x264.Hector.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b9333fcd4c5fca170010a4ca7c5bdfe055b1234","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,147,51,252,212,197,252,161,112,1,10,76,167,197,189,254,5,91,18,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
