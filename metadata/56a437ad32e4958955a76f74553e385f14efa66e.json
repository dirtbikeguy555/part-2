Originally known as Santa Monica, the 'SOS' initialism in the band's name stands for Sounds of Success.\n\nThe band, fronted by Mary Davis, was initially famous for the hit &quot;Take Your Time (Do It Right)&quot; in 1980. In 1983, they joined forces with then new production team of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, who went on to craft a string of R&amp;B hits for the group, including &quot;Just Be Good to Me&quot;, &quot;Tell Me If You Still Care&quot;, &quot;Borrowed Love&quot;, &quot;No One's Gonna Love You&quot;, &quot;Just the Way You Like It&quot; and &quot;The Finest&quot;.\n\nThis is the MOST DEFINITIVE collection.
