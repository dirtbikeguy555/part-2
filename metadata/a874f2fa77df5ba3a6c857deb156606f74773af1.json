It is one of the most acclaimed Australian rock bands of all time, with a string of hits throughout the 1970s and 1980s and huge sales that continue to this day, although its success and acclaim was almost completely restricted to Australia and New Zealand. (Because they were to drunk) \n\nJames Dixon Swan (born 28 April 1956), better known as Jimmy Barnes, is a Scottish-born Australian rock singer-songwriter. His father Jim Swan was a prizefighter and his older brother John Swan is also a rock singer. It was actually John who had encouraged and taught Jim how to sing as he wasn't really interested at the time. His career as both a solo performer and as the lead vocalist with the rock band Cold Chisel has made him one of the most popular and best-selling Australian music artists of all time. The combination of 14 Australian Top 40 albums for Cold Chisel and 13 charting solo albums, including nine No. 1s, gives Barnes the highest number of hit albums of any Australian artist \n\nArtist...............: Cold Chisel and Jimmy Barnes\nAlbum................: Chisel 2CD Anthology 2CD\nGenre................: Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2001 and 1996\nRipper...............: dBpowerAmp\nCodec................: LAME 3.98\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, VBRV0\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\nTags.................: ID3 v2.3\nInformation..........:\nRipped by............: Bubanee \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
