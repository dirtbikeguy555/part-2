With five number-one singles and four number-one albums, the Eagles were among the most successful recording artists of the 1970s. At the end of the 20th century, two of their albums, Eagles: Their Greatest Hits 1971?1975 and Hotel California, ranked among the ten best-selling albums according to the Recording Industry Association of America. The best-selling studio album Hotel California is rated as the 37th album in the Rolling Stone list &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, and the band was ranked #75 on Rolling Stone&amp;#039;s 2004 list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.[1] They are also the best-selling American group ever, with Eagles: Their Greatest Hits 1971?1975 being the best-selling album in the U.S. to date[2] [3]\n\nThe Eagles broke up in 1980 and were disbanded for 14 years, but reunited in 1994 for Hell Freezes Over (&quot;For the record, we never broke up. We just took a fourteen year vacation.&quot;). They have toured intermittently since then, and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998.
