In the same way that The Grateful Dead were often referred to colloquially as &quot;The Dead&quot;, Gov't Mule are often referred to as The Mule.\n\nThe band released their debut album Gov't Mule in 1995, and have since released an additional nine studio albums, plus numerous EPs and live releases. Gov't Mule has become a staple act at music festivals across North America, with both its members and frequent guests boasting members from other notable bands, adding various funk and blues rock elements to the band's sound.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSco-Mule is a live album by the American rock band Gov't Mule. It was recorded at two 1999 shows in Atlanta, Georgia, where original trio (Warren Haynes, Allen Woody and Matt Abts) played with jazz guitarist John Scofield.\n\nThe Atlanta performances, which also featured keyboardist Dan Matrazzo, have been widely traded, discussed and revered by Mule fans for 15 years","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e8a2ca714ee0d0cd107a00b754cbdf9c25b146f","amp;dn":"Gov%27t+Mule+Feat.+John+Scofield+-+Sco-Mule+%5B2015%5D%5B320KBPS%5D%5BLIVE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e8a2ca714ee0d0cd107a00b754cbdf9c25b146f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,138,44,167,20,238,13,12,209,7,160,11,117,76,189,249,194,91,20,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
