The Chicago band is known for melding the style of prog-rock with the power of hard rock guitar, strong ballads, and elements of American musical theater.\n\nThe band is best known for the hit songs &quot;Lady&quot; (#6, 1975), &quot;Come Sail Away&quot; (#8, 1977), &quot;Babe&quot; (#1, 1979), &quot;The Best of Times&quot; (#3, 1981), &quot;Too Much Time on My Hands&quot; (#9, 1981), and &quot;Mr. Roboto&quot; (#3, 1983). Other hits by the band include &quot;Show Me the Way&quot; (#3, 1990), &quot;Don't Let It End&quot; (#6, 1983), and &quot;Renegade&quot; (#16, 1978). The band has four consecutive albums certified multi-platinum by the RIAA.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Grand Illusion is the seventh studio album by Styx, released on July 7, 1977 (7/7/77). The album launched the band to stardom, spawning the hit singles &quot;Come Sail Away&quot; and &quot;Fooling Yourself&quot;, and selling over three million copies in the US.\n\nAccording to keyboardist Dennis DeYoung, the album's theme was the struggle to overcome self-deluding superficiality in order to affirm one's genuine value. This theme was reflected in the lyrics of the album's title track:\n\nso if you think your life is complete confusion\n'cause your neighbor's got it made\njust remember that it's a grand illusion\nand deep inside we're all the same\nThe title of The Grand Illusion had been considered dating back to the 1975 album Equinox.\n\nThe track &quot;Miss America&quot; was guitarist James Young's scathing attack on the Miss America pageant. The idea for the song came to him in the middle of the night. Its sole riff was inspired by the Jethro Tull song &quot;Minstrel in the Gallery&quot;.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fcefc6a5f114c7740bafe8a070994f157d8a347","amp;dn":"Styx+-+The+Grand+Illusion+%5B1977%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fcefc6a5f114c7740bafe8a070994f157d8a347","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,206,252,106,95,17,76,119,64,186,254,138,7,9,148,241,87,216,163,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
