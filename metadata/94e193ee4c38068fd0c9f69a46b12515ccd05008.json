Whilst they won't admit it, they need help and find it in Steve, a young middle class lad who falls for Fiona, the oldest sibling, and increasingly finds himself drawn to this unconventional and unique family. Anarchic family life seen through the eyes of an exceptionally bright fifteen year old, who struggles to come of age in the context of his belligerent father, closeted brother, psychotic sister and internet porn star neighbors.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94e193ee4c38068fd0c9f69a46b12515ccd05008","amp;dn":"Shameless+UK+Season+1-9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94e193ee4c38068fd0c9f69a46b12515ccd05008","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,225,147,238,76,56,6,143,208,201,246,154,70,177,37,21,204,208,80,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
