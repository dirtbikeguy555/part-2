In her Selected Stories, Alice Munro makes lives that seem small unfold until they are revealed to be as spacious as prairies and locates the moments of love and betrayal, desire and forgiveness, that change those lives forever. To read these stories--about a traveling salesman and his children on an impromptu journey; an abandoned woman choosing between seduction and solitude--is to succumb to the spell of a writer who enchants her readers utterly even as she restores them to their truest selves.\n\nGeneral Information\n===================\n Title:                  Selected Stories\n Author:                 Alice Munro\n Read By:                Mary Kane\n Copyright:              1996\n Audiobook Copyright:    2007\n Genre:                  Fiction\n\nFile Information\n================\n Number of MP3s:         22\n Total Duration:         25:25:24\n Total MP3 Size:         1,047.54\n Parity Archive:         No\n Ripped With:            audacity\n Encoded With:           LAME\n Encoded At:             CBR 96 kbit/s 44100 Hz Mono\n Noise Reduction:        Adobe Audition\n ID3 Tags:               Set, v2.3\n\nCONTENTS\n---------------\n\n1.\tWalker Brothers Cowboy\n2.\tDance of the Happy Shades\n3.\tPostcard\n4.\tImages\n5.\tSomething I've Been Meaning To Tell You\n6.\tThe Ottawa Valley\n7.\tMaterial\n8.\tRoyal Beatings\n9.\tWild Swans\n10.\tThe Beggar Maid\n11.\tSimon's Luck\n12.\tChaddeleys and Flemings\n13.\tDulse\n14.\tThe Turkey Season\n15.\tLabor Day Dinner\n16.\tThe Moons of Jupiter\n17.\tThe Progress of Love\n18.\tLichen\n19.\tMiles City, Montana\n20.\tWhite Dump\n21.\tFits\n22.\tFriend of My Youth\n23.\tMeneseteung\n24.\tDifferently\n25.\tCarried Away\n26.\tThe Albanian Virgin\n27.\tA Wilderness Station\n28.\tVandals\n\nPublisher: Vintage (November 11, 1997)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 067976674X\nISBN-13: 978-0679766742\n\nWritten by Alice Munro\nRead by Mary Kane\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
