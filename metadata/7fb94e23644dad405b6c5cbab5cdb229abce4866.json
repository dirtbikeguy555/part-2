But that exception is the beating heart of this extraordinary novel.\n\nMeet the Cooke family: Mother and Dad, brother Lowell, sister Fern, and our narrator, Rosemary, who begins her story in the middle. She has her reasons. Ã¢â‚¬Å“I spent the first eighteen years of my life defined by this one fact: that I was raised with a chimpanzee,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ she tells us. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never going to be the first thing I share with someone. I tell you Fern was a chimp and already you arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t thinking of her as my sister. But until FernÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s expulsion, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d scarcely known a moment alone. She was my twin, my funhouse mirror, my whirlwind other half, and I loved her as a sister.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nRosemary was not yet six when Fern was removed. Over the years, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s managed to block a lot of memories. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s smart, vulnerable, innocent, and culpable. With some guile, she guides us through the darkness, penetrating secrets and unearthing memories, leading us deeper into the mystery she has dangled before us from the start. Stripping off the protective masks that have hidden truths too painful to acknowledge, in the end, Ã¢â‚¬Å“RosemaryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ truly is for remembrance.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fb94e23644dad405b6c5cbab5cdb229abce4866","amp;dn":"We+Are+All+Completely+Beside+Ourselves","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fb94e23644dad405b6c5cbab5cdb229abce4866","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,185,78,35,100,77,173,64,91,108,92,186,181,205,178,41,171,206,72,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
