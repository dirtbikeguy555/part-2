This hands-on book shows you how to build a complete MintDuino project from start to finish. Learn how to assemble the microcontroller on a breadboard (no soldering required), and immediately begin programming it.\n\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll build the MintDuino Reflex Game in five separate stages or sub-tasks. Breaking down a large project into manageable tasks helps you track down errors quickly, and lets you see how each part of the circuit works. Once you complete the game, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have the resources and experience to tackle more MintDuino projects. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re interested in the fascinating world of microcontrollers, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll enjoy this book.\n\n- Wire up and program the MintDuino to light an LED\n- Build a game that tests the reflexes of two players\n- Learn how to make your Ã¢â‚¬Å“game lightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ glow at random intervals\n- Construct a pushbutton circuit to control individual playersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ LEDs\n- Put all of the components together, including simple code to control your game\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1.
