In this updated edition of Image of the World, map expert Peter Whitfield guides readers through a collection of some of the most extraordinary examples of mapsÃ¢â‚¬â€both visually stunning and historically revealing.\n\nAn enormous variety of maps from the last two thousand years are reproduced here in attractive, large-scale color illustrations. These fascinating and vibrant maps include Bishop Isidore of SevilleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first-century design for a circular world map, the elaborately decorated manuscript maps of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and scientific maps of worlds that are still being explored, such as the ocean floor. In addition, Whitfield examines the history of world mapmaking through these outstanding individual examples. He discusses each map in relation to the religious, political, social or economic climates in which it was produced and considers what these maps reveal about the perceptions of their makers.\n\nImage of the World returns to print a gorgeous and informative book that will appeal to map collectors, historians, and armchair explorers alike.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Whitfield uses a wonderful selection of world maps to explain the flow of ideas through the ages.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬â€Time, on the first edition","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1acfaa2df2b834cdcc993b03a57d98e9656c3f2c","amp;dn":"The+Image+of+The+World+-+20+Centuries+of+world+maps+%28History+Map","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1acfaa2df2b834cdcc993b03a57d98e9656c3f2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,207,170,45,242,184,52,205,204,153,59,3,165,125,152,233,101,108,63,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
