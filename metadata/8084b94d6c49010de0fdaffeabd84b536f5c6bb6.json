In one direction lies a future that guarantees, in the watchwords of the cypherpunks, Ã¢â‚¬Å“privacy for the weak and transparency for the powerfulÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; in the other lies an Internet that allows government and large corporations to discover ever more about internet users while hiding their own activities. Assange and his co-discussants unpick the complex issues surrounding this crucial choice with clarity and engaging enthusiasm.\n\nFormats: epub, mobi, pdf\n\nIf you like this book, please consider buying it, \nor make a donation to one of those organisations:\n- Julian Assange defence fund http://justice4assange.com/Donate.html\n- Wikileaks http://shop.wikileaks.org/\n- TorProject, The Onion Routing\n- La Quadrature du Net https://support.laquadrature.net/\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8084b94d6c49010de0fdaffeabd84b536f5c6bb6","amp;dn":"Cypherpunks+-+Freedom+and+the+future+of+the+Internet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8084b94d6c49010de0fdaffeabd84b536f5c6bb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,132,185,77,108,73,1,13,224,253,175,254,171,216,75,83,111,92,107,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
