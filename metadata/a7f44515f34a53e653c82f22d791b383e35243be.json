It co-stars John Goodman, Swoosie Kurtz, and Spalding Gray. Byrne has described the film as, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;A project with songs based on true stories from tabloid newspapers. It\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s like 60 Minutes on acid.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;[1]\n\nTrue Stories was released by Warner Bros. in the US, Canada and Sweden in 1986, with limited release elsewhere the following year. Byrne was given much creative control over the motion picture\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s direction, largely due to the mainstream success of Talking Heads\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' 1984 concert film, Stop Making Sense.\n\nThe majority of the film\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s music is supplied by Talking Heads. A soundtrack album, titled Sounds From True Stories, featured songs by Byrne, Talking Heads, and Terry Allen &amp; The Panhandle Mystery Band, among others. Around the same time, Talking Heads released an album, titled True Stories, which included the band\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s versions of songs featured in the film.\n\nDirected by\tDavid Byrne\nProduced by\tDavid Byrne\nKaren Murphy\nWritten by\tDavid Byrne\nBeth Henley\nStephen Tobolowsky\nStarring\tDavid Byrne\nJohn Goodman\nSpalding Gray\nTito Larriva\nDistributed by\tWarner Bros.\nRelease date(s)\tOctober 10, 1986\nRunning time\t90 min (USA)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7f44515f34a53e653c82f22d791b383e35243be","amp;dn":"True+Stories+%28David+Byrne%2C+1986%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7f44515f34a53e653c82f22d791b383e35243be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,244,69,21,243,74,83,230,83,200,47,34,215,145,179,131,227,82,67,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
