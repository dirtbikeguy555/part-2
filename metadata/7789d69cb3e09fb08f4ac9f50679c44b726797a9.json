It's\n\n    &quot; a little leaner, cleaner and clearer &quot; \n\nthan the first ( &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10270820&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10270820&lt;/a&gt;  ), to quote the scanner.\n\n\n\nPublishers Weekly review:\n\n &quot; Burns's oeuvre is frequently cited as 'strange,' but that's perhaps\n   oversimplifying a world more thought-provokingly described as\n   recognizably like our own, except for when it's not Ã¢â‚¬â€ and it's the\n   difference between the two where Burns's power to shine a light on\n   the darker side of human nature lies. This is the second volume of\n   a trilogy begun in X'ed Out, and as such has an unfinished feeling.\n   We return to Doug, the protagonist, whose recounting of his\n   relationship with a young woman shifts back and forth between the\n   less surreal of the book's two environments and another where his\n   apparent alter ego works in a dreary factory/hospital providing\n   books to its monster patients. Both scenarios occur in an eerie\n   alternate reality whose visuals exude a sense of uncomfortable,\n   riveting silence that fixes the reader's attention to the tale's\n   odd events. Burns's stark work operates on its own nightmare logic\n   and as a result, flesh-crawling events spew forth in the most\n   mundane of settings. Romance comics, misshapen mutants, reptile\n   men, a nightmare of disembowelment that yields a fetal pig,\n   photographic obsessions and more stake out their territory Ã¢â‚¬â€ the\n   result will stick with readers long after being absorbed. &quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7789d69cb3e09fb08f4ac9f50679c44b726797a9","amp;dn":"Charles+Burns%3A+The+Hive+%282012%29+%28GN+-+c2c%29+%28FIXED%29+-+%28invisifan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7789d69cb3e09fb08f4ac9f50679c44b726797a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,137,214,156,179,224,159,176,143,74,201,245,6,121,196,75,114,103,151,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
