The book focuses on the creation of engineering drawings, including dimensions and tolerances and the use of standard parts and tools. Each chapter contains step-by-step sample problems that show students how to apply the concepts presented in the chapter. This book teaches users how to:\nSet up drawings and use the SolidWorks Sketch tools to create 2D drawings that can be extruded into solid 3D models.\nUse the Feature tools to create and modify 3D solid models.\nCreate views using third-angle projection.\nFashion assembly drawings using the Mate tool.\nProduce and design with threads and fasteners (both ANSI inch and ANSI metric threads are covered).\nUse the Design Library to create bearing drawings.\nDraw cams and springs, add hubs and keyways to cams, and insert the cams into assembly drawings.\nProduct Details\nPaperback: 552 pages\nPublisher: Prentice Hall; 1 edition (May 21, 2009)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0135024293\nISBN-13: 978-0135024294\n\n[poly-technic.blogspot]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:285970eabf993f387fea0f5987c9329eed1a96f5","amp;dn":"Engineering+Design+and+Graphics+with+SolidWorks+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"285970eabf993f387fea0f5987c9329eed1a96f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,89,112,234,191,153,63,56,127,234,15,89,135,201,50,158,237,26,150,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
