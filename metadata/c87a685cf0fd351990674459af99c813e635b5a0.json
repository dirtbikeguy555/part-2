Convinced that he has discovered alien transmissions, Ziminski\nis first chastised and then fired by his boss (Ron Silver). Obsessed, he\nbuilds a makeshift radio telescope in his house to find out where the signals\nwere sent. Convinced that they're intended for aliens already hidden on\nEarth, he tracks them to a bleak, isolated Mexican village, where he joins\nforces with a female scientist (Lindsay Crouse), who has suspicions of her\nown after witnessing an acceleration of global warming. The villagers turn\nout to be aliens, and the village a front for an underground alien complex.\nThe aliens are here to terraform Earth and prepare it for the arrival of\nthe rest of their race, who will die unless they leave their homeworld and\ncolonize elsewhere. Only Ziminski can stop them.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Charlie Sheen.\n=&gt;-Lindsay Crouse.\n=&gt;-Richard Schiff.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-David Twohy.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Action : Mystery : Sci-Fi.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 1996.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.72 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 2 133 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 55mn.\n=&gt;-The Arrival................: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1071267-arrival/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 1.85:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1920 x 1040.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 2000 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 128 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 249 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c87a685cf0fd351990674459af99c813e635b5a0","amp;dn":"The+Arrival+-+Charlie+Sheen+Sci-Fi+1996+Eng+Subs+1080p+%5BH264-mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c87a685cf0fd351990674459af99c813e635b5a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,122,104,92,240,253,53,25,144,103,68,89,175,153,200,19,230,53,181,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
