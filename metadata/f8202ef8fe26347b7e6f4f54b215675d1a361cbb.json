Catholic Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg had been gravely wounded in Tunisia. As he recovered he vowed to dedicate his life to the cause of ending Hitler's. His daring attempt would nearly succeed, and prove to be the climax in the long quest to cut the head off the Nazi snake. But Hitler's revenge would prove fast and furious.\r\nIn the darkest days of World War II, St. Peter's was shrouded in the shadow of the swastika. But even as the FÃ¼hrer surrounded him, the Pope was plotting a secret counter-offensive. Wartime Pontiff Pius XII has been derided for his public silence about the Holocaust. But evidence suggests his silence may have been subterfuge. And the man branded as &quot;Hitler's Pope&quot; may actually have wanted to eliminate him.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f7/Pope-vs-Hitler-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b4/Pope-vs-Hitler-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/38/Pope-vs-Hitler-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b3/Pope-vs-Hitler-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b5/Pope-vs-Hitler-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1c/Pope-vs-Hitler-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/67/Pope-vs-Hitler-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c2/Pope-vs-Hitler-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f5/Pope-vs-Hitler-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/44/Pope-vs-Hitler-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/87/Pope-vs-Hitler-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e4/Pope-vs-Hitler-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video: Bitrate: CRF-22 (~2496 Kbps)\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 88 mins,\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.63 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://sheencenter.org/shows/pope-vs-hitler/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8202ef8fe26347b7e6f4f54b215675d1a361cbb","amp;dn":"Pope+vs+Hitler+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8202ef8fe26347b7e6f4f54b215675d1a361cbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,32,46,248,254,38,52,123,126,111,79,84,178,21,103,93,26,54,28,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
