In 2001, von Trier convinces veteran filmmaker JÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸rgen Leth to create five remakes of his 1967 short The Perfect Human. Calling himself the Obstructor, von Trier orders Leth to make his films in various parts of the world with extremely specific demands. For instance, the first film must be shot in Cuba with no set with only 12 frames per shot. The five remakes-within-the-film are &quot;The Perfect Human: Bombay,&quot; &quot;The Perfect Human: Brussels,&quot; &quot;The Perfect Human: Cartoon,&quot; &quot;The Perfect Human: Cuba,&quot; and &quot;The Perfect Human: AvedÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¸re, Denmark.&quot; Each has its own set of ridiculous limitations created by von Trier. The Five Obstructions was shown at the Sundance Film Festival as part of a special screening.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : The Five Obstructions.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 27mn\n      Bit rate : 2229 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 11.5 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n      IAS1 : Dansk\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Custom\n      PlayTime : 1h 27mn\n      Bit rate : 2089 Kbps\n      Width : 704 pixels\n      Height : 400 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 16/9\n      Frame rate : 29.970 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.247\n      StreamSize : 1.27 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 1h 27mn\n      Bit rate : 131 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 81.8 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.90.\n      Encoding settings : ABR","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b089ea2ad175e5827c65cd01a7133e2358400b2","amp;dn":"The+Five+Obstructions+-+von+Trier%2C+Leth+%282003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b089ea2ad175e5827c65cd01a7133e2358400b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,8,158,162,173,23,94,88,39,198,92,208,26,113,51,226,53,132,0,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
