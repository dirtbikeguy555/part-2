And to negotiate these hurdles with style and confidence, Men's Style is indispensable---a valuable source of practical advice for how to dress in a world of conflicting fashion imperatives, and a witty guide to the history, trends, codes, and conventions of men's attire.\n \nIn chapters and amusing sidebars on shoes, suits, shirts and ties, formal and casual wear, underwear and swimsuits, cufflinks and watches, coats, hats, and scarves, Russell Smith steers a confident course between the twin hazards of blandness and vulgarity to articulate a philosophy of dress that can take you anywhere.\n \nHere you'll find the rules for looking the part at the office, a formal function, or the hippest party---and learn when you can toss those rules aside. And you'll find level answers to all of your questions. What color suit should a man buy first? Should socks match the belt, pants, or shoes? What tuxedos are always in, and which aren't ever? And what's required of ambiguous social situations like &quot;dress casual&quot; and &quot;black-tie optional&quot;? The answers are here, in a book that's full of trivia, history, and guidance---finally, the perfect guide for brothers, fathers, sons, and selves.\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n\n[\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6eb6125b5a931fb2e2e1cbf61d3c0e41f9c5d17","amp;dn":"Men%27s+Style%3A+The+Thinking+Man%27s+Guide+to+Dress+-+Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6eb6125b5a931fb2e2e1cbf61d3c0e41f9c5d17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,235,97,37,181,169,49,251,46,46,28,191,97,211,192,228,31,156,93,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
