Hosted by Pete Evans and Manu Feildel.\n\nRob and Dave Queensland\nWe just love the same things: fishing, golf, cooking, eating, entertaining. \nRob and Dave met when their kids started at the same primary school together. Turns out they lived in the same street and these neighbours became instant friends.\n&quot;I think we just loved the same things: fishing, golf, cooking, eating, entertaining,&quot; recalls Dave.\nThose kids Ã¢â‚¬â€œ just turned 21 so it's been a long- standing friendship. Along with Dave's wife and daughter, and Rob's wife and son they've enjoyed many a dinner party together.\nExplains Dave, 51: &quot;I'd invite them over for dinner and you know I'd be cooking and Rob would be like, 'Hang on, he's cooking.' And then he'd be in the kitchen chatting about cooking. And then we'd go to his house and he'd be in the kitchen cooking and you know the blokes were cooking and it was a little bit different.&quot;\nRob, 48, agrees adding: &quot;We take the reigns if we're having a dinner party or entertaining.&quot;\nThe mates Ã¢â‚¬â€œ who both own their own businesses - enjoy a beer or two while discussing and preparing their meals.\nRob admits a fast-paced life might've prevented him from spending more time in the kitchen with the kids when they were younger, but he's now passing on his passion whenever he can.\n&quot;My daughter will ring me up and say, 'Dad I'm cooking this, what do I do?' And I give her a few little tips.&quot;\nRob says they make just about everything from scratch, while Dave admits the only two ingredients likely to come from a can when they're cooking is canned tomatoes and stock if they're short of time.\nDave says cooking is his artistic outlet. &quot;We're not artistic in any way; we can't paint, can't draw, can't sing, can't play a musical instrument. But we can cook. And it's like an artistic outlet, it's out passionate artistic outlet really.&quot;\nThe keen fishermen have been known to take a day off work if the weather is optimum to cast away and hopefully bring home the catch for dinner.\nHating to be a stereotype, they admit they lack experience when it comes to desserts.\n&quot;Even the humble old sponge cake has given us trials and tribulations,&quot; says Rob. &quot;You wouldn't think it could be hard but it bloody is.&quot;\nAdds Dave: &quot;I tried four different recipes for sponge cakes and one looked like a pancake, one was dog crap, two of them were cakes but they weren't sponge cakes.&quot;\nBut the one thing they do have in spades is great comradery and teamwork","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:130d2244b30c42c1482579ba36a73833d5141d37","amp;dn":"My.Kitchen.Rules.s06e14.WS.PDTV.x264.BF1.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"130d2244b30c42c1482579ba36a73833d5141d37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,13,34,68,179,12,66,193,72,37,121,186,54,167,56,51,213,20,29,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
