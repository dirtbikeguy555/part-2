As BublÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© eagerly absorbed the recordings, he began to realize that he wanted to be a singer and that this style of music, virtually foreign to his own generation, was what he wanted to perform. With his grandfather's assistance, BublÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© soon learned a whole catalog of tunes and gained experience and exposure by singing as a guest with several local bands. While still in his teen years, he won the Canadian Youth Talent Search, released several independent albums, and performed in a musical revue titled Swing that traveled across the U.S. It wasn't long before BublÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© was introduced to Grammy-winning producer David Foster and signed his first major recording contract with Reprise Records.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Cry Me A River\n02.All Of Me\n03.Georgia On My Mind\n04.Crazy Love\n05.Haven't Met You Yet\n06.All I Do Is Dream Of You\n07.Hold On\n08.Hearache Tonight\n09.You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You\n10.Baby (You've Got What It Takes)\n11.At This Moment\n12.Stardust\n13.Whatever It Takes\n14.Some Kind Of Wonderful (Bonus Track)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n               ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d51560070eab92eb76e70ca3def8d8541fdfc232","amp;dn":"Michael+Buble+-+Crazy+Love+%5BBonus+Track%5D+2009+++CBR320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d51560070eab92eb76e70ca3def8d8541fdfc232","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,21,96,7,14,171,146,235,118,231,12,163,222,248,216,84,31,223,194,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
