Upon his arrival he finds out that the job is no longer available and an unforeseen turn of events leads Blake to kill Dickinson's son. However Blake is injured and a bullet is lodged near his heart; hanging in the balance between life and death and hunted by Dickinson's head-hunters, he embarks in a spiritual journey into the wilderness of the West guided by an Indian mystic named Nobody. Jarmusch delivers us his most poetic, spiritual and allegorical film to date, a dark, surreal Western unlike any you have ever seen. A lot can also be said about Neil Young's moody musical score. Much underrated and overlooked, this is probably the best film to come out of America during the '90s.\n\nhttp://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&amp;sql=1:134741\n\n\nwww.freakyflicks.tk\n\nSEED AS LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU HAVE DOWNLOADED...PLEASE!\n\n'If we all seed just 1:1, give at least what we take, this torrent will NEVER DIE'\n\n... simply search for 'freakyflicks' \n*************************************** \n************** FREAKYFLICKS ************* \n***************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3846a12de167f190ee607d8af7d8e53c1e159ce","amp;dn":"Jim+Jarmusch+-+Dead+Man+%281995%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3846a12de167f190ee607d8af7d8e53c1e159ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,132,106,18,222,22,127,25,14,230,7,216,175,125,142,83,193,225,89,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
