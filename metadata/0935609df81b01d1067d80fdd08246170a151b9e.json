PyQt 4 is probably the fastest and easiest route into GUI programming and works on Windows, Mac OS X, and most operating systems that use the X Window System, such as Linux and many Unices.\nThe book will be useful to people who program professionally as part of their job, whether as full-time software developers, or those from other disciplines, including scientists and engineers, who need to do some programming in support of their work. It is also suitable for students?the only prerequisite is basic knowledge of an object oriented programming language, for example, Java or C++, or of course Python itself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0935609df81b01d1067d80fdd08246170a151b9e","amp;dn":"Rapid+GUI+Programming+with+Python+and+Qt+%28Oct.+2007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0935609df81b01d1067d80fdd08246170a151b9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,53,96,157,248,27,1,209,6,125,128,253,208,130,70,23,10,21,27,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
