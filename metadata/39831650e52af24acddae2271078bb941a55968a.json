Well produced and what I would consider all killer no filler. Be sure to check out $5 Steak - it might have some of you scratching your heads wondering if they've gone too deep with the ice but I dig it.\n\nSUPPORT THE ARTISTS - BUY THE CD\n\nNOTE: This is PREVIEW quality. The actual cd sounds less tinny, more full and rich and it allows you can truly appreciate the great production this album has.\n\nFiles are VBR MP3. Very listenable but not representative of cd quality.
