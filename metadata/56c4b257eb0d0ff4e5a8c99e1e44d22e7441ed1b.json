Formed in the late 2000s by lead vocalist Rick DeJesus and lead guitarist Chris Iorio, the band (which also included rhythm guitarist Keith Wallen, bassist Derek Johnston, and drummer Trevor Stafford) released its eponymous debut on Virgin Records in July 2009. The band's sophomore effort, Home School Valedictorian, arrived in summer 2011 and featured new lead guitarist Robert Zakaryan after Iorio left the group within five months of their debut's release. At the end of 2012, writing began for the band's third album, while only six months later, Keith Wallen announced that he was leaving. In July 2013 the group entered the studio with Grammy Award-winning producer Nick Raskulinecz to record Stuck, which was released the following year. ~ James Christopher Monger &amp; Rich Wilson, Rovi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56c4b257eb0d0ff4e5a8c99e1e44d22e7441ed1b","amp;dn":"Adelitas+Way+-+Stuck+-+Deluxe+Edition+-+%5B2014%5D+%28320%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56c4b257eb0d0ff4e5a8c99e1e44d22e7441ed1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,196,178,87,235,13,15,244,229,168,201,158,30,68,210,46,116,65,237,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
