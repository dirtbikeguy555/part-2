HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a professor of literature, a student of American hedonism, and an amateur musician and photographer. When he finds a student attractive, Consuela, a 24-year-old Cuban, he sets out to seduce her. Along the way, he swims in deeper feelings, maybe heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drowning. She presses him to sort out what he wants from her, and a relationship develops. They talk of traveling. He confides in his friend, George, a poet long-married, who advises David to grow up and grow old. She invites him to meet her family. His own son, from a long-ended marriage, confronts him. Is the elegy for lost relationships, lost possibilities, beauty and time passing, or failure of nerve?\n\nInfo: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0974554/\nRelease Date: 18 February 2008 (Spain)\nGenre: Drama | Romance\nStars: Ben Kingsley, PenÃƒÂ©lope Cruz, Patricia Clarkson\nQuality: BluRay 720p\nEncoder: FatNanda@Ganool\nSource: 720p.BluRay.x264.DTS-WiKi\nSize: 750MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d363d1a9ba29e37db167514072b2c65c1f43bc47","amp;dn":"Elegy+%282008%29+BluRay+720p+750MB+Ganool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d363d1a9ba29e37db167514072b2c65c1f43bc47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,99,209,169,186,41,227,125,177,103,81,64,114,178,198,92,31,67,188,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
