She's the chic daughter of a renowned art collector and covert forger (the always eccentric Hugh Griffith) who's deposited his best work, a famous statue, in a Paris museum. Trouble is, technology can now detect such forgery, so Hepburn plots to steal the statue with the help of O'Toole, an amateur thief and covert inspector. Of course, neither of them knows the whole truth about the other.\n\n  Starring: Audrey Hepburn, Peter O'Toole, Hugh Griffith, Eli Wallach, Charles Boyer.\n\n  Directed by: William Wyler.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 2hr. 3min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 720 x 336","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17cabbf75c9613f0585f2f6bc3bf69cc84d0eaa5","amp;dn":"How+to+Steal+a+Million+%281966%29+%28Audrey+Hepburn%2C+Peter+O%5C%27To","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17cabbf75c9613f0585f2f6bc3bf69cc84d0eaa5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,202,187,247,92,150,19,240,88,95,47,107,195,191,105,204,132,208,234,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
