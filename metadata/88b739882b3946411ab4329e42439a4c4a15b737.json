This latest edition for Windows, RPG MAKERÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ XP, has an outstanding level of freedom even compared to the other titles in the RPG MAKER series. Let&amp;#039;s take a look at some of its features. \n\nEasy to Use\n \nYou might think it&amp;#039;s hard to make a game, but it&amp;#039;s a breeze to find your way around RPG MAKER XP.\n \nFirst, make a map that&amp;#039;ll serve as the stage for your adventure, then set up your heroes, enemy monsters, items, magic-everything you need for a good RPG. Finally, create some events and place them around the map, and your very own original RPG is complete. Mapmaking is as simple as a jigsaw puzzle when you have tiles to work with! You can even use ready-made graphics for the heroes and monsters, so all you have to do is give them some stats and a name. \n\nThe Freedom of Effortless Event Creation\n  \nTownspeople, dungeons, treasure chests, boss battles-all of the things that help develop an RPG&amp;#039;s story can be created through events. You&amp;#039;ll find all sorts of events stored under Event Commands, from simple text and graphic displays to variable-wrangling technical tricks. Just select a series of commands and you&amp;#039;ve created an event. You can even find clever ways of stringing together these commands for more sophisticated events-or sneak in a trap or two.\n \nExpanded Sample Data\n \nRPG MAKER XP comes complete with tons of sample data, including character graphics, monster graphics, map tiles, magic effect graphics, battle backgrounds, landscape graphics, background music, sound effects, and more. You&amp;#039;ll never have to draw a single pixel if you use these ready-made materials to create your RPG masterpiece. Of course, you can also draw everything from scratch if you&amp;#039;d prefer. RPG MAKER XP supports the PNG graphic format as well as the MIDI, WAV, and Ogg Vorbis sound formats, making it easy to include your own original data.\n \nDistribute Your Games\n \nSave your completed game as a game disk and you can burn it onto a CD-ROM to give to your friends or distribute it over the Internet for other gamers to enjoy. You can even market your creations as shareware. \n\nSystem Requirements\n \n* Operating system: Microsoft Windows 98/98SE/Me/2000/XP ...(Vista..??)\n* Processor 800MHz \n* 128 MB RAM \n* Video adapter 1024x768 or better video resolution in High Color mode \n* Sound card DirectSound-compatible sound card \n* 100 MB Free Disc Space \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88b739882b3946411ab4329e42439a4c4a15b737","amp;dn":"RPG+Maker+XP+Special+Edition+Full+%2B+Keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88b739882b3946411ab4329e42439a4c4a15b737","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,183,57,136,43,57,70,65,26,180,50,158,66,67,154,76,74,21,183,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
