In this issue Mythbuster, model maker, and combat roboticist Grant Imahara talks about hacking everything from a giant spiderbot to R2-D2. Check out the latest in humanoid robots and open-source robotic platforms. Then, build your own bots that follow the sunlight or scuttle about in a hamster ball and delve into biorobotics by hacking a venus flytrap to close on command.\n\n\tPlus, build a super-efficient backyard oven, launch a compressed air rocket with wings that snap open to glide back to Earth, pick up the basics of IntelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new Arduino-compatible Galileo board, and learn to paint on leather using the classic Lego Space logo.
