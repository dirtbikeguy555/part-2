I mean Big Papi is not a video guy so forgive the larger than necessary size, but you will find the quality as good as the source DVD with stereo sound preserved. There is 4 hours of video so that could explain the overall size.\n\n- Big Papi\n\n\n\n\nA Customer wrote:\n\nWell, what can I say? This is what every Pantera fan could ever want. All 3 videos, 4 hours of total Pantera.\nCowboys from Hell: The Videos- The shortest, but 60% of it is all music. Awesome live performance of &quot;The Art of Shredding&quot; and &quot;Heresy&quot;\n\nVulgar Video- 1 hour long, the FUNNIEST of all 3. Expect to crack up on most parts. It has live clips of &quot;Domination&quot; and &quot;Primal Concrete Sledge&quot;\n\nWatch It Go- 2 full hours of Pantera. Covers footage from 1994 to 1996, but there are no live songs here.\n\n- A real Pantera fan shouldn't be without this DVD. Hail Pantera, the Kings of all that is Metal.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73f14ddf83907115e3c559fae8a59a399503ee6f","amp;dn":"PANTERA+3+Vulgar+Videos+From+Hell+%28Big+Papi%29+MP4+1999","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73f14ddf83907115e3c559fae8a59a399503ee6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,241,77,223,131,144,113,21,227,197,89,250,232,165,154,57,149,3,238,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
