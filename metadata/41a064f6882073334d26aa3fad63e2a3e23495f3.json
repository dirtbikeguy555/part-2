The sound and length of vowels and tones help differentiate the meaning of words.\nSwedish spelling is largely phonetic. Once you know the sound each letter represents, you can approach accurate pronunciation of new words with confidence.\nThere are two categories of Swedish nounsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½common and neuterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that determine the form of adjectives associated with those nouns.\nWord order in Swedish is predictable, and the main verb is the second component of a sentence.\nVerbs in Swedish only change for differences in tense. You donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have to conjugate them for different subjects.\nSwedish speakers rarely use formal speech, though they do use it in some dialects.\nLearning Swedish gives you a head start if you decide to learn Danish or Norwegian. The languages are closely related and are often understood by native speakers and experienced learners.\n\nThis set will help you:\n\nBuild your vocabulary and language abilities\nSpell and write accurately\nSpeak without a script\nRetain what youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve learned\nRead and understand your new language\nShare ideas and opinions, express feelings and talk about everyday life\n\nSample topics include:\n\nThe basics, such as age and family relations\nQuestions, greetings, introductions\nTimes of day, calendar terms, the weather\nDirections, locations, telling time\nPresent, past and future tense\nApologies and polite requests\nHow to order at a restaurant and give and receive directions\nEmotions, opinions and ideas\nPolitical, media, business and religious terms\n\nRequirements for Rosetta Stone User Workstations\n\nWindows (32-bit editions only) 2000, XP or Vista, Mac OS X 10.4 or 10.5\n512 MB RAM\n1 GHz or faster processor speed\n600 MB free hard-drive space (per level)\n16-bit sound card\n800 x 600 display resolution (1024 x 768 recommended)\nInternet or phone connection required for product activation\nSpeech recognition feature requires a headset microphone (included with purchase)\n16X CD-ROM Drive (for installation)\n\nNote for MicrosoftÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® Windows VistaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ users:\n\nCurrent Rosetta Stone products have been engineered to install and run on the Windows Vista operating system.
