A seaman hires on as a janitor at an insane asylum to free his wife, who's become an inmate after attempting to kill herself and her baby. The film's expressionist style is all the more surprising because Japan had no such tradition to speak of; Kinugasa hadn't even seen The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari when he made this. Yet the rhythmic pulsation of graphic, semiabstract depictions of madness makes the film both startling and mesmerizing.\n\nA stunning invocation of the world as viewed by the mentally ill, within minutes, as the rapid montage of the opening storm sequences dissolves into the surrealistic fantasy of the sailor's wife dressed in an exotic costume dancing in front of art-deco inspired backdrop featuring a large spinning ball flanked by ornate fountains, A Page of Madness bowls you over with a barrage of startling images utilising every technique in the book known to filmmakers of the time. Just ask anyone who's seen it. Even now, Kinugasa's film seems as fresh as a daisy and when seen on the big screen, as eye-popping an experience as anything you're likely to see released nowadays.\n\nFile Name .........................................: Kurutta ippeji.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,045,958,656 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 59:13.522\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 640x472 (AR: 1.356)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1961 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.271 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 384 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0017048/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0017048/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNo language, no subtitles\n\nMy rip of a DVD from a TCM capture","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5af95e37c19b8707ba641767f9932a8be8daf2cc","amp;dn":"Teinosuke+Kinugasa+-+Kurutta+ippeji+%5BA+Page+of+Madness%5D+%281926%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5af95e37c19b8707ba641767f9932a8be8daf2cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,249,94,55,193,155,135,7,186,100,23,103,249,147,42,139,232,218,242,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
