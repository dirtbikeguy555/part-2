From smartphones and tablets to MP3 players and digital cameras, this resource will build your understanding of how the latest electronic circuits work. You'll dive into hands-on projects and walk through the calculations and concepts for key circuits to get you up to speed. As you progress through the chapters, you'll learn how to build the circuits, and then observe or measure how they work so you can apply the information on your own.\n\n-    Learn how to control the flow of electric current\n-    Design a transistor circuit, and compare the switching action of a JFET and a BJT\n-    Explore the use of resistors, capacitors, and inductors in bandpass and band-reject filters\n-    Use BJTs, JFETs, and operational amplifiers in amplifier circuits\n-    Find out how an oscillator works, and then design and build one\n-    Discover how a transformer converts AC voltage to a higher or lower voltage\n-    Calculate the values of components that produce a specified DC output voltage for a power supply circuit\n\nThe book's website ( &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.buildinggadgets.com)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.buildinggadgets.com)&lt;/a&gt; provides project pages that include links to suppliers and are kept up to date with supplier part numbers for components you'll need.\n\nAbout the Authors\nEarl Boysen is a veteran engineer who maintains two technology-focused websites, www.buildinggadgets.com and www.understandingnano.com. He is coauthor of the first edition of Electronics For Dummies as well as Electronics Projects For Dummies and Nanotechnology For Dummies, all published by Wiley.\nThe late Harry Kybett wrote the bestselling first and second editions of Electronics Self-Teaching Guide. He was director of engineering operations at Columbia Pictures Corporation. He built many studios and video systems for the broadcasting industry, and created training programs for Sony Corporation of America. \n\nCONTENTS\nChapter 1: DC Review and Pre-Test\nChapter 2: The Diode\nChapter 3: Introduction to the Transistor\nChapter 4: The Transistor Switch\nChapter 5: AC Pre-Test and Review\nChapter 6: Filters\nChapter 7: Resonant Circuits\nChapter 8: Transistor Amplifiers\nChapter 9: Oscillators\nChapter 10: The Transformer\nChapter 11 : Power Supply Circuits\nChapter 12: Conclusion and Final Self-Test\nAppendix A: Glossary\nAppendix B: List of Symbols and Abbreviations\nAppendix C: Powers of Ten and Engineering Prefixes\nAmendix D: Standard Com~osition Resistor Values\nAppendix E: Supplemental Resources\nAppendix F: Equation Reference\nAppendix G: Schematic Symbols Used in This Book","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:398507ea3cb4a9995dd24646d63c526c01ee3de2","amp;dn":"Complete+Electronics+Self-Teaching+Guide+with+Projects+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"398507ea3cb4a9995dd24646d63c526c01ee3de2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,133,7,234,60,180,169,153,93,210,70,70,214,60,82,108,1,238,61,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
