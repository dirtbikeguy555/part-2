How can officials identify the most dangerous New York City manholes before they explode? And how did Google searches predict the spread of the H1N1 flu outbreak?\n\nThe key to answering these questions, and many more, is big data. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Big dataÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ refers to our burgeoning ability to crunch vast collections of information, analyze it instantly, and draw sometimes profoundly surprising conclusions from it. This emerging science can translate myriad phenomenaÃ¢â‚¬â€from the price of airline tickets to the text of millions of booksÃ¢â‚¬â€into searchable form, and uses our increasing computing power to unearth epiphanies that we never could have seen before. A revolution on par with the Internet or perhaps even the printing press, big data will change the way we think about business, health, politics, education, and innovation in the years to come. It also poses fresh threats, from the inevitable end of privacy as we know it to the prospect of being penalized for things we havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t even done yet, based on big dataÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ability to predict our future behavior.\n\nIn this brilliantly clear, often surprising work, two leading experts explain what big data is, how it will change our lives, and what we can do to protect ourselves from its hazards. Big Data is the first big book about the next big thing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e28dcee3465690bb69c22fff2f4fa5c65503af49","amp;dn":"Big+Data%3A+A+Revolution+That+Will+Transform+How+We+Live%2C+Work%2C+an","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e28dcee3465690bb69c22fff2f4fa5c65503af49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,141,206,227,70,86,144,187,105,194,47,255,47,79,165,198,85,3,175,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
