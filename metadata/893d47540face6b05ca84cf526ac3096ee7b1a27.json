What did average Egyptians eat, drink, wear, gossip about, and aspire to? What were their amusements, their beliefs, their attitudes concerning religion, childrearing, nudity, premarital sex? Mertz ushers us into their homes, workplaces, temples, and palaces to give us an intimate view of the everyday worlds of the royal and commoner alike. We observe priests and painters, scribes and pyramid builders, slaves, housewives, and queensâ€”and receive fascinating tips on how to perform tasks essential to ancient Egyptian living, from mummification to making papyrus.\r\n\r\nAn eye-opening and endlessly entertaining companion volume to Temples, Tombs, and Hieroglyphs, Mertz's extraordinary history of ancient Egypt, Red Land, Black Land offers readers a brilliant display of rich description and fascinating edification. It brings us closer than ever before to the people of a great lost culture that was so different fromâ€”yet so surprisingly similar toâ€”our own","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:893d47540face6b05ca84cf526ac3096ee7b1a27","amp;dn":"Red+Land%2C+Black+Land%3A+Daily+Life+in+Ancient+Egypt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"893d47540face6b05ca84cf526ac3096ee7b1a27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,61,71,84,15,172,230,176,92,168,76,245,38,172,48,150,238,123,26,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
