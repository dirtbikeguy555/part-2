The word seduction stems from Latin and means literally &quot;to lead astray&quot;. As a result, the term may have a positive or negative connotation. Famous seducers from history or legend include Lilith, Giacomo Casanova and the character Don Juan. Seduction as a phenomenon is not the subject of scientific interest, although similar, more specific terms like short term mating, casual sex or mating strategies are used in Evolutionary psychology. Internet enabled the existence of Seduction Community which is based around pseudoscientific discourse on seduction.\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
