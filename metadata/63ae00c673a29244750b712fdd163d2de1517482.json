And what does he have to do with the judgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s untimely demise? His name, for the moment, is Malcolm Bannister. Job status? Former attorney. Current residence? The Federal Prison Camp near Frostburg, Maryland.\n\nOn paper, MalcolmÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s situation isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t looking too good these days, but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got an ace up his sleeve. He knows who killed Judge Fawcett, and he knows why. The judgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s body was found in his remote lakeside cabin. There was no forced entry, no struggle, just two dead bodies: Judge Fawcett and his young secretary. And one large, state-of-the-art, extremely secure safe, opened and emptied.\n\nWhat was in the safe? The FBI would love to know. And Malcolm Bannister would love to tell them. But everything has a priceÃ¢â‚¬â€especially information as explosive as the sequence of events that led to Judge FawcettÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death. And the Racketeer wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t born yesterday . . .\n\nNothing is as it seems and everythingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fair game in this wickedly clever new novel from John Grisham, the undisputed master of the legal thriller\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63ae00c673a29244750b712fdd163d2de1517482","amp;dn":"The+Racketeer+by+John+Grisham+%5BePUB%2FMobi%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63ae00c673a29244750b712fdd163d2de1517482","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,174,0,198,115,162,146,68,117,11,113,47,221,22,61,45,225,81,116,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
