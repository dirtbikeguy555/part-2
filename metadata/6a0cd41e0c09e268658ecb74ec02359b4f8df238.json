The purpose of such programming is automating the usage of processing and measuring equipment in any laboratory setup\n\n\nWhat is NI LabVIEW?\n\nLabVIEW is a graphical programming environment used by millions of engineers and scientists to develop sophisticated measurement, test, and control systems using intuitive graphical icons and wires that resemble a flowchart. It offers unrivaled integration with thousands of hardware devices and provides hundreds of built-in libraries for advanced analysis and data visualization - all for creating virtual instrumentation. The LabVIEW platform is scalable across multiple targets and OSs, and, since its introduction in 1986, it has become an industry leader.\n\nKey Features\n\n- Faster Programming\n- Data Display and User Interfaces\n- Multicore Programming\n- Training and Certification\n- Hardware Integration\n- Multiple Targets and OSs\n- Data Storage and Reporting\n- Community\n- Advanced Analysis\n- Multiple Programming Approaches\n\nMore info: National Instruments: Test, Measurement, and Embedded Systems\n\nNI LabVIEW 2011 Release Details:\n\nLabVIEW 2011 Accelerates EngineersÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ Productivity\n\nNI LabVIEW 2011 is the latest version of the only system design software that provides engineers and scientists with the tools they need to create any measurement and control systems. It simplifies system design by offering access to the newest high-performance and low-cost entry points to the reconfigurable I/O (RIO) platform, to one of the highest bandwidth vector signal analyzers on digitizers on the market, and to the latest off-the-shelf hardware while delivering enhanced compatibility with .NET objects and .m file structures.\n\nThe latest version of LabVIEW has been further tailored for the engineer with improvements and features taken directly from user feedback. It delivers new engineering-specific libraries of UI controls, math and signal processing IP, and advanced APIs for controlling asynchronous threads and programmatically compiling LabVIEW code into an executable. LabVIEW 2011 is designed to help engineers accelerate their productivity whether they are first-time users or longtime experts.\n\nThis version includes new features for LabVIEW and all LabVIEW modules as well as updates and bug fixes to the rest of the LabVIEW platform.
