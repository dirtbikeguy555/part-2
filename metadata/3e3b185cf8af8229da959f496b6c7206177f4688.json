Managers can no longer afford to discuss these two topics independently. This book is meant to eliminate the seat-of-the-pants intuition and rough approximations that have been far too prevalent in software development management. The growing popularity of agile methods has shown that a healthy balance between strict process and individual flexibility can be achieved. David Anderson takes it a step farther, and explains how the healthy balance of agility can help businesses become more profitable. The result is a book that will allow managers to foster teams that produce better software, less expensively, on time, and with fewer defects.\n\n\nPaperback: 336 pages\nPublisher: Prentice Hall; 1 edition (17 Sep 2003)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0131424602\nISBN-13: 978-0131424609\nProduct Dimensions: 2 x 17.3 x 23.6 cm\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
