They are of the aiff format on the site.  But I downloaded them and converted them to mp3 using Cool Edit Pro to 192 bps mp3PRO audio coding tecnology Fraunhofer IIS.  The sound quality is very good.  Some of them I did not take the time to figure what key they are in yet, but most were already labeled with the key, I figured some of them out, and will do the rest later.  I tagged them with the information from the website, I hope I got the info right, but if something on the tags is wrong, please comment here for me so I can fix it.  This is alot of good music to jam with, and I hope you enjoy it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caff20737ee5ef5da8653f4fcfc1656d871e296d","amp;dn":"79+Blues+Backing+Tracks+%28Jam+Tracks%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caff20737ee5ef5da8653f4fcfc1656d871e296d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,255,32,115,126,229,239,93,168,101,63,79,207,193,101,109,135,30,41,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
