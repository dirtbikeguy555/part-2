Our machine was devastating. And versatile. It could do everything but stop.\r\n\r\nMichael Herr went to Vietnam as a war correspondent for Esquire. He returned to tell the real story in all its hallucinatory madness and brutality, cutting to the quick of the conflict and its seductive, devastating impact on a generation of young men. His unflinching account is haunting in its violence, but even more so in its honesty.\r\n\r\nFirst published in 1977, Dispatches was a revolutionary piece of new journalism that evoked the experiences of soldiers in Vietnam and has forever shaped our understanding of the conflict. It is now a seminal classic of war reportage.\r\n\r\nRead by Ray Porter\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\r\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcdd03811ba1cd497fdf079ae0d8fe1a169ff7fa","amp;dn":"Michael+Herr+-+Dispatches","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcdd03811ba1cd497fdf079ae0d8fe1a169ff7fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,221,3,129,27,161,205,73,127,223,7,154,224,216,254,26,22,159,247,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
