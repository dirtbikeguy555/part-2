Delong, raised in the suburbs of Seattle, headed south to Los Angeles with a toolbox of Wii-motes, keyboards, and drums to develop a live rock show that CMJ Magazine claims worthy of ''an 8-bit warrior, seamlessly creating danceable electro beats with his Wii Remote and Sega Genesis controller on par with the Chemical Brothers.'' Having performed his genre-bending songs since 2010, Delong uses MIDI interfaces, a full drum set, drum pads, keyboards, laptops and game controllers, looping his music live to fuse electronic dance beats with striking melodies and lyrics with emotional heart.\n\n\nArtist: Robert DeLong\nReleased: January 22, 2013\nLabel: 2013 Glassnote\nTracks: 12\nTotal Length: 49:18\nFormat: 320 kbps MP3\n\n\n1.
