Spearheaded by Batman scribe Scott Snyder, the series is written by Tim Seeley, Ray Fawkes, Kyle Higgins and James Tynion IV, who also co-plotted the entire arc with Snyder. Former Detective Comics writer John Layman was part of the original writing team, and contributed to early issues, but left the project prior to release for personal reasons and to focus on wrapping up his creator owned series Chew. After Layman's departure, it was announced that former Nightwing writer Kyle Higgins had replaced him. Spanning over a year, the series plans to tell an all-encompassing game changer of a story that not only includes Batman and his well known supporting cast, but many of the obscure, lesser known characters, as well as reintroducing some characters into New 52 continuity for the first time, most notably the fan-favorite Stephanie Brown. Prior to release, readers were given a taste of what as to come in Eternal with the flash-forward issue, Batman #28 - Gotham Eternal, which showed Gotham under martial law as well as new roles from characters such as Harper Row and Catwoman.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5b5493e4f997c34177f80cb144f3ead4a74cfdd","amp;dn":"Batman+Eternal+%28001+-+026%29+%282014+-+Ongoing%29+%28Digital%29+%28Nahga-Emp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5b5493e4f997c34177f80cb144f3ead4a74cfdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,181,73,62,79,153,124,52,23,127,128,203,20,79,62,173,74,116,207,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
