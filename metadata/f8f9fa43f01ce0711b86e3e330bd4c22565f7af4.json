Since then he's released four studio albums (and one live set, the British import Live Wood); Modern Classics is a democratic collection, choosing three tracks from Paul Weller, four tracks from each of the rest, and adding one new single, &quot;Brand New Start,&quot; for good measure. There's not a loser in the lot, but the remarkable thing to note here is the coherence of this collection: Weller's mature rock and love of classic soul has resulted in a sound that's remained remarkably consistent over the course of the 1990s. There's plenty more that could've been included--his cover of &quot;Sexy Sadie&quot; and the touching &quot;Has My Fire Really Gone Out?&quot; just for starters--which simply means there are plenty of reasons to mine his catalog after Modern Classics whets your appetite.\n\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Out Of The Sinking\n[02] Peacock Suit\n[03] Sunflower\n[04] The Weaver\n[05] Wild Wood\n[06] Above The Clouds\n[07] Uh-Huh Oh-Yeh\n[08] Brushed\n[09] The Changingman\n[10] Friday Street\n[11] You Do Something To Me\n[12] Brand New Start\n[13] Hung Up\n[14] Mermaids\n[15] Broken Stones\n[16] Into Tomorrow \n\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 00h:54m:54s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 140mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v8.2.0.23 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic Video Format \t- N / A\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Rock\n\nOriginally Released\t- 08 December 1998\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Island Records\n\nArtists Website\t\t- http://www.paulweller.com/index.php \n\t\t\t-\n\t\t\t-\n \n\n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  - Too Many Pages To Check * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8f9fa43f01ce0711b86e3e330bd4c22565f7af4","amp;dn":"%5B1998%5D+Modern+Classics+The+Greatest+Hits+-+Paul+Weller+%40+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8f9fa43f01ce0711b86e3e330bd4c22565f7af4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,249,250,67,240,28,224,113,27,134,227,227,48,189,76,34,86,95,122,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
