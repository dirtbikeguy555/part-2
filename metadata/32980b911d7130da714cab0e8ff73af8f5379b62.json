First, Dave covers EQ techniques, from boosting to cutting, notch filtering, tone sculpting, and hardware emulation. Next, he discusses compression, including automatic levelers, multiband compression, side chaining, and hardware emulation. He moves into reverb, showing how to utilize the basic algorithms and parameters of different types of reverbs to create sonic ambience and a sense of space. Then, Dave covers delay and modulation effects, including multitap delays, flangers, and some tricks for adding bottom end, width, and crunch to the mix. Finally, he'll cover some the basics of mastering, including master buss compression, EQing the master buss, and maximizing the output level.\n\nTopics include:\n- Tone shaping with the Renaissance EQ\n- Notch filtering with the Q-Series EQs\n- Controlling levels with the Renaissance Compressor\n- Side chaining\n- Utilizing algorithmic reverb in R-Verb and TrueVerb\n- Modulating delay with MondoMod\n- Adding crunch with amp simulation\n- Sweetening the mix","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32980b911d7130da714cab0e8ff73af8f5379b62","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Mixing+Techniques+with+Waves+Plugins","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32980b911d7130da714cab0e8ff73af8f5379b62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,152,11,145,29,113,48,218,113,76,171,14,143,247,58,248,245,55,155,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
