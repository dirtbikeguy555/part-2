In addition, each audio file has an ID3 tag image of the book's album cover, the proper track number (in relation to all the tracks), and proper title and chapter information.  \n\nThis makes it MUCH easier to enjoy while listening on a smart phone or other mp3 player, go back and re-listen, or keep track of where you left off.  I figured if I'm going to go through the trouble of properly organizing the files, I may as well share it with the world.  I also included the eBook to follow along with.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n=========================================================================================\n\nIn The Power of Habit, award-winning New York Times business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new \n\nunderstanding of human nature and its potential for transformation.\n \nAlong the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter &amp; Gamble, Target superstores, Rick WarrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and \n\ndeath.\n \nAt its core, The Power of Habit contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work.\n \nHabits arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t destiny. As Charles Duhigg shows, by harnessing this new science, we can transform our businesses, our communities, and our lives. \n\n=========================================================================================\n\nAUDIO FILES:\n\n01 - Introduction\n   01 - Introduction.mp3\n   02 - Prologue - The Habit Cure.mp3\n\n02 - Part One - The Habits of Individuals\n   03 - Ch01 - The Habit Loop; How Habits Work - Part 01.mp3\n   04 - Ch01 - The Habit Loop; How Habits Work - Part 02.mp3\n   05 - Ch01 - The Habit Loop; How Habits Work - Part 03.mp3\n   06 - Ch01 - The Habit Loop; How Habits Work - Part 04.mp3\n   07 - Ch02 - The Craving Brain; How To Create New Habits - Part 01.mp3\n   08 - Ch02 - The Craving Brain; How To Create New Habits - Part 02.mp3\n   09 - Ch02 - The Craving Brain; How To Create New Habits - Part 03.mp3\n   10 - Ch02 - The Craving Brain; How To Create New Habits - Part 04.mp3\n   11 - Ch02 - The Craving Brain; How To Create New Habits - Part 05.mp3\n   12 - Ch03 - The Golden Rule of Habit Change; Why Transformation Occurs - Part 01.mp3\n   13 - Ch03 - The Golden Rule of Habit Change; Why Transformation Occurs - Part 02.mp3\n   14 - Ch03 - The Golden Rule of Habit Change; Why Transformation Occurs - Part 03.mp3\n   15 - Ch03 - The Golden Rule of Habit Change; Why Transformation Occurs - Part 04.mp3\n   16 - Ch03 - The Golden Rule of Habit Change; Why Transformation Occurs - Part 05.mp3\n\n03 - Part Two - The Habits of Successful Organizations\n   17 - Ch04 - Keystone Habits, or the Ballad of Paul O'Neil; Which Habits Matter Most - Part 01.mp3\n   18 - Ch04 - Keystone Habits, or the Ballad of Paul O'Neil; Which Habits Matter Most - Part 02.mp3\n   19 - Ch04 - Keystone Habits, or the Ballad of Paul O'Neil; Which Habits Matter Most - Part 03.mp3\n   20 - Ch05 - Starbucks and the Habit of Success; When Willpower Becomes Automatic - Part 01.mp3\n   21 - Ch05 - Starbucks and the Habit of Success; When Willpower Becomes Automatic - Part 02.mp3\n   22 - Ch05 - Starbucks and the Habit of Success; When Willpower Becomes Automatic - Part 03.mp3\n   23 - Ch05 - Starbucks and the Habit of Success; When Willpower Becomes Automatic - Part 04.mp3\n   24 - Ch05 - Starbucks and the Habit of Success; When Willpower Becomes Automatic - Part 05.mp3\n   25 - Ch06 - The Power of A Crisis; How Leaders Create Habit Through Accident and Design - Part 01.mp3\n   26 - Ch06 - The Power of A Crisis; How Leaders Create Habit Through Accident and Design - Part 02.mp3\n   27 - Ch06 - The Power of A Crisis; How Leaders Create Habit Through Accident and Design - Part 03.mp3      \n   28 - Ch06 - The Power of A Crisis; How Leaders Create Habit Through Accident and Design - Part 04.mp3\n   29 - Ch07 - How Target Knows What You Want Before You Do; When Companies Predict (and Manipulate) Habits - Part 01.mp3\n   30 - Ch07 - How Target Knows What You Want Before You Do; When Companies Predict (and Manipulate) Habits - Part 02.mp3\n   31 - Ch07 - How Target Knows What You Want Before You Do; When Companies Predict (and Manipulate) Habits - Part 03.mp3\n   32 - Ch07 - How Target Knows What You Want Before You Do; When Companies Predict (and Manipulate) Habits - Part 04.mp3\n\n04 - Part Three - The Habits of Societies\n   33 - Ch08 - Saddleback Church and the Montgomery Bus Boycott; How Movement Happens - Part 01.mp3\n   34 - Ch08 - Saddleback Church and the Montgomery Bus Boycott; How Movement Happens - Part 02.mp3\n   35 - Ch08 - Saddleback Church and the Montgomery Bus Boycott; How Movement Happens - Part 03.mp3\n   35 - Ch08 - Saddleback Church and the Montgomery Bus Boycott; How Movement Happens - Part 03.mp3\n   36 - Ch09 - The Neurology of Free Will; Are We Responsible For Our Habits - Part 01.mp3\n   37 - Ch09 - The Neurology of Free Will; Are We Responsible For Our Habits - Part 02.mp3\n   38 - Ch09 - The Neurology of Free Will; Are We Responsible For Our Habits - Part 03.mp3\n   39 - Ch09 - The Neurology of Free Will; Are We Responsible For Our Habits - Part 04.mp3\n\n=========================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1282a573b1c905bc080a94ff3ac9d53dcb2727b5","amp;dn":"The+Power+of+Habit+-+Charles+Duhigg+%28organized+audio+%2B+ebook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1282a573b1c905bc080a94ff3ac9d53dcb2727b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,130,165,115,177,201,5,188,8,10,148,255,58,201,213,61,203,39,39,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
