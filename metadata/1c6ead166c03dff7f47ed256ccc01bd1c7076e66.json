The only duties the duo were willing to dole out were the vocals. The album features longtime collaborator  Anneli Drecker as well as guest appearances by Swedish artists Robyn, Lykke Li and The Knife's Karin Dreijer on two tracks.\nSvein Berge, one half of the Norwegian electronic duo, explains: If Melody A.M. was a relaxed journey inwards on a Sunday afternoon and The Understanding was more uptempo, with more vocals and a hint of melodic catchiness, then the new album is a mix of the two.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c6ead166c03dff7f47ed256ccc01bd1c7076e66","amp;dn":"Royksopp+-+Junior+%5Bmp3-192-2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c6ead166c03dff7f47ed256ccc01bd1c7076e66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,110,173,22,108,3,223,247,244,126,210,86,204,192,27,209,199,7,110,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
