Every question it raises leads to new answers, new discoveries, and new smarter questions. The science of evolution is as expansive as nature itself. It is also the most meaningful creation story that humans have ever found.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Bill Nye\n\n Sparked by a controversial debate in February 2014, Bill Nye has set off on an energetic campaign to spread awareness of evolution and the powerful way it shapes our lives. In Undeniable: Evolution and the Science of Creation, he explains why race does not really exist; evaluates the true promise and peril of genetically modified food; reveals how new species are born, in a dog kennel and in a London subway; takes a stroll through 4.5 billion years of time; and explores the new search for alien life, including aliens right here on Earth.\n\n With infectious enthusiasm, Bill Nye shows that evolution is much more than a rebuttal to creationism; it is an essential way to understand how nature worksÃ¢â‚¬â€and to change the world. It might also help you get a date on a Saturday night.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“With his charming, breezy, narrative style, Bill empowers the reader to see the natural world as it is, not as some would wish it to be. He does it right. And, as I expected, he does it best.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Neil deGrasse Tyson, Ph.D, host of Cosmos\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This gracefully written book provides a tour through not just the big ideas of evolution, but why evolution is such a captivating idea scientifically, philosophically, and emotionally. Written from the heartÃ¢â‚¬â€but science always comes from the heart with Bill Nye.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Eugenie C. Scott, Ph.D., author of Evolution vs. Creationism: An Introduction\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Bill Nye has penned one of the clearest and most moving explanations of that process since DarwinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s On the Origin of Species. With clarity and passion, Nye brings evolutionary theory to life.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Michael Shermer, Ph.D., author of Why Darwin Matters and The Moral Arc","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e68f05a71cdcf59d3b8b701914a4ae7a42dece72","amp;dn":"Undeniable%3A+Evolution+and+the+Science+of+Creation+%282014%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e68f05a71cdcf59d3b8b701914a4ae7a42dece72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,143,5,167,28,220,245,157,59,139,112,25,20,164,174,122,66,222,206,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
