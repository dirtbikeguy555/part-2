It was first published in 1999.\n\nIn intimate detail, Lee recounts the battles against colonialists, communists and communalists that led to SingaporeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s independence. With consummate political skill, he countered adversaries, sometimes enlisting their help, at others opposing them, in the single-minded pursuit of SingaporeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interests. We read how he led striking unionists against the colonial government, how over tea and golf he fostered ties with key players in Britain and Malaya, of secret midnight meetings in badly lit rooms, drinking warm Anchor beer with a communist underground leader, of his purposeful forging of an alliance with communists to gain the support of the Chinese-educated masses. Readers will find inspiration in his tenacity as he fought for the peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hearts and minds against first the communists and later the communalists Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in parliament, on the streets and through the media","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c15976c097d631de2fe68515d26ea9d4604d0137","amp;dn":"The+Singapore+Story%3A+Memoirs+of+Lee+Kuan+Yew","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c15976c097d631de2fe68515d26ea9d4604d0137","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,89,118,192,151,214,49,222,47,230,133,21,210,110,169,212,96,77,1,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
