This is good music, especially track 2, but it is very dark goth-like soft-punk and maybe not for those of you who live blissful and happy lives. If you open your soul to the tunes and lyrics it can drag you into despair. If Satan had a favorite band this would be it.\n\n- Big Papi\n\n\nBy Anthony Nasti\n\nI first became familliar with Nick Cave through an article in Entertainment Weekly. I found him to be a very interesting person and I seriously considered getting into his music, but I didn't buy one of his album until about a week ago.\n\n&quot;The Best Of The Nick Cave &amp; The Bad Seeds&quot; is a 16 track collection of some of the most amazing songs I've ever heard. Cave's lyrics more often than not approach the same level of complexity and brilliance as those of Dylan and Lennon. Songs like &quot;Red Right Hand&quot;, &quot;Tupelo&quot;, the achingly beautiful &quot;Into Your Arms&quot; and many other songs here are some of the most vivid musical experiences one can ever have. Other standouts include the wild &quot;From Her To Eternity&quot;, the eerie &quot;Stranger Than Kindness&quot; and the heartwrenching &quot;Nobody's Baby Now&quot;.\n\nThe liner notes makes for a good read and the sound quality is great. Definitely a must for fans of good music.\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nNick Cave &amp; the Bad Seeds - The Best of Nick Cave &amp; the Bad Seeds\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Nick Cave &amp; the Bad Seeds\nAlbum................: The Best of Nick Cave &amp; the Bad Seeds\nGenre................: Rock\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1998 05 26\n\nFLAC\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 63 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 264kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
