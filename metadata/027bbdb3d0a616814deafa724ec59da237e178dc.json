Oh sure, the new health care is great, but the public ban on the use of swords has left a lot of defeated samurai with a difficult decision to make concerning their future career paths! This is especially true if, as in the case of Gintoki Sakata, they're not particularly inclined towards holding a day job, which is why Gintoki's opted for the freelance route, taking any job that's offered to him as long as the financial remuneration sounds right. Unfortunately, in a brave new world filled with stray bug-eyed monsters, upwardly mobile Yakuza and overly ambitious E.T. entrepreneurs, those jobs usually don't pay as well as they should for the pain, suffering and indignities endured!\n\n: Screen Shots : &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/K1adMBE.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/K1adMBE.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/eK6qeMF.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/eK6qeMF.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/6hBg1Dl.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/6hBg1Dl.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/xfKjWN7.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/xfKjWN7.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/PNYumOo.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/PNYumOo.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor updates and direct download links, visit my blog or my facebook page.\n\n:Greetz:\nTo All Silver RG Encoders, All STHD Encoders &amp; All Other P2P RGs\n\n:Note:\nMake sure its real Silver RG Release From Silver RG Member.\n\nWe Are Looking For Early Access To Anything You Can Provide CAMS, TS, DVD Screeners, VHS Screeners, DVDRips, Direct Audio, Early Music Release, Anything You Can Provide Seedboxes, Accounts, Dedicated Servers - Contact Us @ sources [at] silvertorrent [dot] org\n\n:Support:\nTook 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 24 Hours to Upload &amp; Seed\nTook 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\nTakes 10 Seconds to say &quot;Thank You&quot;, or 4 seconds to say &quot;Whoooo&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:027bbdb3d0a616814deafa724ec59da237e178dc","amp;dn":"Gintama+%28Season+1%29+%28001-049%29+480p+PirateBoy+SilverRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"027bbdb3d0a616814deafa724ec59da237e178dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,123,189,179,208,166,22,129,77,234,250,114,78,197,157,162,55,225,120,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
