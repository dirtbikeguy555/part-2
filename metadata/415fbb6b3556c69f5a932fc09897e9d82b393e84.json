And they made it big because they not only could immerse themselves in a groove, but they also had concise pop skills. &quot;Little Miss Can't Be Wrong&quot; and &quot;Two Princes&quot; were cleverly written singles, full of clean, blues-inflected licks and ingratiating pop melodies. Pocket Full of Kryptonite had been around for nearly a year when MTV and radio began playing &quot;Little Miss Can't Be Wrong,&quot; but once they started playing it, they couldn't stop. The Spin Doctors became an overnight sensation, selling millions of albums around the world. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Jimmy Olsen's Blues\n02.What Time Is It\n03.Little Miss Can't Be Wrong\n04.Forty Or Fifty\n05.Refrigerator Car\n06.More Than She Knows\n07.Two Princes\n08.Off My Line\n09.How Could You Want Him (When You Know You Could Have Me?)\n10.Shinbone Alley/Hard To Exist\n\n               \n               Big thanks &amp; respects to the original uploader Only1joe!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:415fbb6b3556c69f5a932fc09897e9d82b393e84","amp;dn":"Spin+Doctors-Pocket+Full+Of++Kryptonite+%5BCD+Rip%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"415fbb6b3556c69f5a932fc09897e9d82b393e84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,95,187,107,53,86,198,159,90,147,47,192,152,151,233,216,43,57,62,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
