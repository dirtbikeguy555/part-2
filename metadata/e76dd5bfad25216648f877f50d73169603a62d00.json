We dare you not to.\n\nFROM THE AUTHOR:\nThis is a book I wrote. Because I wrote it, I had to figure out what to put on the back cover to explain what it is. I tried to write a long, third-person summary that would imply how great the book is and also sound vaguely authoritativeÃ¢â‚¬â€like maybe someone who isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t me wrote itÃ¢â‚¬â€but I soon discovered that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not sneaky enough to pull it off convincingly. So I decided to just make a list of things that are in the book:\n\nPictures\nWords\nStories about things that happened to me\nStories about things that happened to other people because of me\nEight billion dollars*\nStories about dogs\nThe secret to eternal happiness*\n\n*These are lies. Perhaps I have underestimated my sneakiness!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e76dd5bfad25216648f877f50d73169603a62d00","amp;dn":"Hyperbole+and+a+Half+-+Allie+Brosh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e76dd5bfad25216648f877f50d73169603a62d00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,109,213,191,173,37,33,102,72,248,119,245,13,115,22,150,3,166,45,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
