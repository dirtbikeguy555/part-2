Running on a coin-sized battery, BLE can operate reliably for years, connecting and extending everything from personal area network devices to next-generation sensors. Now, one of the standardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s leading developers has written the first comprehensive, accessible introduction to BLE for every system developer, designer, and engineer.\n\n\n\nRobin Heydon, a member of the Bluetooth SIG Hall of Fame, has brought together essential information previously scattered through multiple standards documents, sharing the context and expert insights needed to implement high-performance working systems. He first reviews BLEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s design goals, explaining how they drove key architectural decisions, and introduces BLEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s innovative usage models. Next, he thoroughly covers how the two main parts of BLE, the controller and host, work together, and then addresses key issues from security and profiles through testing and qualification. This knowledge has enabled the creation of Bluetooth Smart and Bluetooth Smart Ready devices.\n\n\n\nThis guide is an indispensable companion to the official BLE standards documents and is for every technical professional and decision-maker considering BLE, planning BLE products, or transforming plans into working systems.\n\n\n\nTopics Include\n\nBLE device types, design goals, terminology, and core concepts\nArchitecture: controller, host, applications, and stack splits\nUsage models: presence detection, data broadcasting, connectionless models, and gateways\nPhysical Layer: modulation, frequency band, radio channels, power, tolerance, and range\nDirect Test Mode: transceiver testing, hardware interfaces, and HCI\nLink Layer: state machine, packets, channels, broadcasting, encryption, and optimization\nHCI: physical/logical interfaces, controller setup, and connection management\nL2CAP: channels and packet structure, and LE signaling channels\nAttributes: grouping, services, characteristics, and protocols\nSecurity: pairing, bonding, and data signing\nGeneric Access Profiles: roles, modes, procedures, security modes, data advertising, and services\nApplications, devices, services, profiles, and peripherals\nTesting/qualification: starting projects, selecting features, planning, testing, compliance, and more\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1191796e8f6d82ed062c4f35239ca3f3e51a8669","amp;dn":"Bluetooth+Low+Energy+The+Developer%27s+Handbook+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1191796e8f6d82ed062c4f35239ca3f3e51a8669","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,145,121,110,143,109,130,237,6,44,79,53,35,156,163,243,229,26,134,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
