Philip Lehman and Gabriel Roth aka Bosco Mann were driven by their love of 60s and 70s soul music to form their own band and the Desco Records label, and with the addition of former correctional officer Sharon Jones (b. Sheron Lafaye Jones, 4 May 1956, Augusta, Georgia, USA) on vocals recorded several albums of deliberately retro funk and soul. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nContains:\t\tCover Art, ID Tags, Cue, Log\n\n\n\n\n\nDap-Dippin' With...
