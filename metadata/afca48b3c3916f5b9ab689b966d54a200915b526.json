His defiance leads to a battle between those loyal to Ramses XIII and the power structure of the priests. At the time Poland's most expensive film, director Jerzy Kawalerowicz spent three years making this huge widescreen epic. But this is no Cecil B DeMille spectacle. Co-screenwriter Tadeusz Konwicki regarded it as a penetrating analysis of a system of power. Previously released internationally only in a severely truncated version Pharaoh has now been restored to its spectacular original form.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 1024x400, 24.000 fps, 1963 Kbps, 02h31m51s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, 6 channel, 256 kbps\r\n\r\nBRRip, Polish audio\r\n\r\nOptional subtitles Bosnian, Czech, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek\r\n                   Polish forced, Portuguese-Brazil, Romanian, Spanish\r\n \nhttps://extraimago.com/images/2016/09/24/3ced3077e0353d2611166831548e5160.jpg \nhttps://extraimago.com/images/2016/09/24/d0f7c008fc2ea03ee9651094c7c68432.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afca48b3c3916f5b9ab689b966d54a200915b526","amp;dn":"Pharaoh+-+Faraon+%5B1966+-+Poland%5D+multi+subs+epic+drama","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afca48b3c3916f5b9ab689b966d54a200915b526","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,202,72,179,195,145,111,91,154,182,137,185,102,213,74,32,9,21,181,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
