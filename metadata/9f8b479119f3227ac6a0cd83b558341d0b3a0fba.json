This eclectic collection goes beyond her horror writing, revealing the full spectrum of her literary genius. In addition to Come Along with Me, Jackson's unfinished novel about the quirky inner life of a lonely widow, it features sixteen short stories and three lectures she delivered during her last years.\n\nThe Road Through the Wall: \nPepper Street is a really nice, safe California neighborhood. The houses are tidy and the lawns are neatly mowed. Of course, the country club is close by, and lots of pleasant folks live there. The only problem is they knocked down the wall at the end of the street to make way for a road to a new housing development. Now, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not goodÃ¢â‚¬â€itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just not good at all.\n\nHangsaman:\nSeventeen-year-old Natalie Waite longs to escape home for college. Her father is a domineering and egotistical writer who keeps a tight rein on Natalie and her long-suffering mother. When Natalie finally does get away, however, college life doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bring the happiness she expected. Little by little, Natalie is no longer certain of anythingÃ¢â‚¬â€even where reality ends and her dark imaginings begin. \n\nThe Sundial: \nWhen the Halloran clan gathers at the family home for a funeral, no one is surprised when the somewhat peculiar Aunt Fanny wanders off into the secret garden. But then she returns to report an astonishing vision of an apocalypse from which only the Hallorans and their hangers-on will be spared, and the family finds itself engulfed in growing madness, fear, and violence as they prepare for a terrible new world.\n\nThe Bird's Nest:\nElizabeth is a demure twenty-three-year-old wiling her life away at a dull museum job, living with her neurotic aunt, and subsisting off her dead motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inheritance. When Elizabeth begins to suffer terrible migraines and backaches, her aunt takes her to the doctor, then to a psychiatrist. But slowly, and with JacksonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s characteristic chill, we learn that Elizabeth is not just one girlÃ¢â‚¬â€but four separate, self-destructive personalities. \n\nThe Lottery and Other Stories:\nThe Lottery, one of the most terrifying stories written in this century, created a sensation when it was first published in The New Yorker. &quot;Power and haunting,&quot; and &quot;nights of unrest&quot; were typical reader responses. This collection, the only one to appear during Shirley Jackson's lifetime, unites &quot;The Lottery:&quot; with twenty-four equally unusual stories.\n\nThe Haunting of Hill House\nFirst published in 1959, Shirley Jackson's The Haunting of Hill House has been hailed as a perfect work of unnerving terror. It is the story of four seekers who arrive at a notoriously unfriendly pile called Hill House: Dr. Montague, an occult scholar looking for solid evidence of a &quot;haunting&quot;; Theodora, his lighthearted assistant; Eleanor, a friendless, fragile young woman well acquainted with poltergeists; and Luke, the future heir of Hill House. At first, their stay seems destined to be merely a spooky encounter with inexplicable phenomena. But Hill House is gathering its powers-and soon it will choose one of them to make its own. \n\nJust an Ordinary Day\nThe stories in this edition represent the great diversity of her work, from humor to her shocking explorations of the human psyche. The tales range, chronologically, from the writings of her college days and residence in Greenwich Village in the early 1940s, to the unforgettably chilling stories from the period just before her death. They provide an exciting overview of the evolution of her craft through a progression of forms and styles, and add significantly to the body of her published work.\n\nJust an Ordinary Day is a testament to how large a talent Shirley Jackson had and to the depth, breadth, and complexity of her writing. Though this remarkable literary life was cut short, Jackson clearly established a unique voice that has won a permanent place in the canon of outstanding American literature, and remains a powerful influence on generations of readers and writers.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f8b479119f3227ac6a0cd83b558341d0b3a0fba","amp;dn":"Shirley+Jackson+eBook+Collection+%289+eBooks%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f8b479119f3227ac6a0cd83b558341d0b3a0fba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,139,71,145,25,243,34,122,198,160,205,131,181,88,52,29,11,58,15,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
