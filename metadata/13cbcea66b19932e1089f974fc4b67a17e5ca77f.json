Set during Prohibition, Lehane's highly anticipated take on the Roaring 20s features Joe Coughlin, a police captain's son who enters into the intensely violent world of organized crime.\r\n\r\nBy 1926, Prohibition in the United States had given rise to an endless network of underground distilleries, speakeasies, gangsters, and corrupt cops. Joe Coughlin, the youngest son of a prominent Boston police captain, defies his proper upbringing by climbing a ladder of organized crime that takes him from Boston to Ybor City, Florida, to Havana, Cuba, where he encounters a dangerous cast of characters who are all fighting for their piece of the American dream","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13cbcea66b19932e1089f974fc4b67a17e5ca77f","amp;dn":"LIVE+BY+NIGHT+-+Dennis+Lehane+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13cbcea66b19932e1089f974fc4b67a17e5ca77f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,203,206,166,107,25,147,46,16,137,249,116,252,75,103,161,126,92,167,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
