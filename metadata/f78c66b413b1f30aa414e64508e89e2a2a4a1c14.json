You would be surprised at how many useless files might be laying around on your hard disks. The files and folders are automatically sorted by size, with the biggest sizes first.\n\nWhile the app is measuring a folder the user can browse the files within that folder and immediately see the size in bytes. Hidden files, cache files, directories will all show up with their corresponding size.\n\n* Once the measuring of a folder has ended the user can also view the\n  information by filtering for particular file sizes or types. The user can\n  also move unwanted files and folders in the corresponding Trash bin\n  similar to the FinderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Delete button.\n\n* With DeLocalizer you can remove those unwanted locales for languages\n  you never knew existed.\n\n* With NibÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢o Suction you can clean up all those unnecessary, forgotten\n  nib files. Most likely these files were left over from the development\n  process. Considering there are hundreds of these, they add up.\n\n* With Lipo Suction you can trim up binary files by removing the unused\n  architecture bytes.\n\n* With Find Duplicates you can quickly and easily find duplicate files.\n\n* For those of us, using Solid State Drives, being able to thin the boot volume by a few extra gigabytes will be a good thing.\n\nWhats New:\n\n* Added preference pane to better handle CSV exports.\n\n* Added measuring of TimeMachine volumes. This feature will help\n  identify local TimeMachine snapshots.\n\n* Addressed rare crash related to missing local host name.\n\n* Addressed rare crash related to the file system having changed from\n  under the application.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nIntel Mac, OS X.4 or greater\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f78c66b413b1f30aa414e64508e89e2a2a4a1c14","amp;dn":"WhatSize+v.+5.2.1+with+Core+keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f78c66b413b1f30aa414e64508e89e2a2a4a1c14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,140,102,180,19,177,243,10,164,20,230,69,8,232,158,42,42,74,28,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
