Pepper, but featuring stronger compositions and more rock-oriented ensemble work. The group was still pushing forward in all facets of its art, whether devising some of the greatest harmonies to be heard on any rock record (especially on &quot;Because&quot;), constructing a medley of songs/vignettes that covered much of side two, adding subtle touches of Moog synthesizer, or crafting furious guitar-heavy rock (&quot;The End,&quot; &quot;I Want You (She's So Heavy),&quot; &quot;Come Together&quot;). George Harrison also blossomed into a major songwriter, contributing the buoyant &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; and the supremely melodic ballad &quot;Something,&quot; the latter of which became the first Harrison-penned Beatles hit. Whether Abbey Road is the Beatles' best work is debatable, but it's certainly the most immaculately produced (with the possible exception of Sgt. Pepper) and most tightly constructed. \n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.soundstagedirect.com/media/abbey_road.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.soundstagedirect.com/media/abbey_road.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Tracklist :.\n\nLato A\n\n1.
