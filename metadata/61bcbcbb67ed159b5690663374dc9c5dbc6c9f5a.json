Now he has compiled a complete guide to survival in the urban jungle. Every year in America there are thousands of fatal accidents in the homeÃ¢â‚¬â€more than on the roads, and many more than in the great outdoors. Fire, electricity, water, gas, sharp knives, poisons, chemicalsÃ¢â‚¬â€these valuable tools can quickly become dangerous weapons when not treated with proper respect and understanding. Add to these the risks of travel, terrorism, muggings, rape, tsunamis, and earthquakes. We are constantly reminded that the world is a dangerous place. Wiseman shows readers how to think realistically and practically about these perils in order to avoid them, whether they are at home, on the street, in school, or in transit. From self-defense techniques to home security systems to coping with natural disasters, this book will teach readers to recognize risks, make quick decisions, and live confidently in the modern urban world. 100 color illustrations\n\n\nBy John &quot;Lofty&quot; Wiseman\nPublished by Skyhorse Publishing in 2008\nEPUB, Retail, 640 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61bcbcbb67ed159b5690663374dc9c5dbc6c9f5a","amp;dn":"SAS+Urban+Survival+Handbook+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61bcbcbb67ed159b5690663374dc9c5dbc6c9f5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,188,188,187,103,237,21,155,86,144,102,51,116,220,156,93,188,108,159,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
