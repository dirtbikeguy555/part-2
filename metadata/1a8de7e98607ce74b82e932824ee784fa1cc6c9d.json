Abnormal refraction, less than one and negative, in PC and MM are studied in a third part, addressing super-focusing and cloaking.\r\n\r\nApplications for telecommunications, lasers and imaging systems are also explored","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a8de7e98607ce74b82e932824ee784fa1cc6c9d","amp;dn":"Artificial+Materials+-+Olivier+Vanb%26eacute%3Bsien","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a8de7e98607ce74b82e932824ee784fa1cc6c9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,141,231,233,134,7,206,116,184,46,147,40,36,238,120,79,161,204,108,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
