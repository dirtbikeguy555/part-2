A rousing oompah band from a small Eastern European village travel to America to find their fortune. They all have hairdos like Buddy Holly on acid and wear the pointiest-toed shoes you&amp;#039;ve ever seen. In New York City they buy an old Cadillac and get a gig to play a wedding in Mexico. On the trip there they also travel through rock, blues, country, and mariachi, and meet people almost as strange as themselves. Most memorable moment: Igor, the village idiot, catching up to the band out in the middle of the Texas countryside, carrying a very large fish.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:788a5fd9bf3e3c8259f14c1ddd2a19b5a50898d1","amp;dn":"Leningrad+Cowboys+Go+America","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"788a5fd9bf3e3c8259f14c1ddd2a19b5a50898d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,138,95,217,191,62,60,130,89,241,76,29,221,42,25,181,165,8,152,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
