Slayer rose to fame with its 1986 release Reign in Blood, and is credited as one of the &quot;big four&quot; thrash metal bands, along with Metallica, Megadeth, and Anthrax. Between 1991 and 2013, the band sold 4.9 million albums in the United States.\n\nOn May 2, 2013, guitarist Jeff Hanneman died of liver failure in a local hospital near his home in Southern California's Inland Empire; the cause of death was later determined to be alcohol-related cirrhosis. King confirmed the band will continue, saying &quot;Jeff is going to be in everybody's thoughts for a long time. It's unfortunate you can't keep unfortunate things from happening. But we're going to carry on Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and he'll be there in spirit.&quot; However, Araya has been more uncertain about the band's future, expressing his belief that &quot;After 30 years [with Hanneman active in the band], it would literally be like starting over&quot; \n\nAt the 2014 RevolverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Å 'Ã¢â‚¬â€¹s Golden Gods Awards ceremony, Slayer debuted &quot;Implode&quot;, its first new song in five years. The group announced that they have signed to Nuclear Blast, and will release a new album in 2015. It was reported that Holt would take over Hanneman's guitar duties, although Holt did not participate in the song-writing. In February, Slayer announced a seventeen date American tour to start in June featuring Suicidal Tendencies and Exodus. In 2015, Slayer headlined the Rockstar Energy Mayhem Festival for the second time. Repentless, the band's eleventh studio album is expected to be released on September 11.\nSo to get everyone caught up on our releases here is a Twist.\n\n\n1.Cast The First Stone mp3\n2.Repentless mp3\n3.When the Stillness Comes mp3\n4.Implode mp3\n\n\nBe Watching out cause the touring will once again resume and there is your chance to see and support the band","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d829094d19e3ed2183b7c810b93529ff41f67c39","amp;dn":"Slayer-+With+A+Twist+%28EP%29+2015+ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d829094d19e3ed2183b7c810b93529ff41f67c39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,41,9,77,25,227,237,33,131,183,200,16,185,53,41,255,65,246,124,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
