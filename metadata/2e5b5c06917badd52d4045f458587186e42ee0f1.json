In a hunt that takes Zach and Kylie from celebrity penthouses to the depths of Manhattanâ€™s criminal underworld, they have to find the cold-blooded killer â€“ before he strikes again","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e5b5c06917badd52d4045f458587186e42ee0f1","amp;dn":"NYPD+Red+4+-+James+Patterson+%26amp%3B+Marshall+Karp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e5b5c06917badd52d4045f458587186e42ee0f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,91,92,6,145,123,173,213,45,64,69,244,88,88,113,134,228,46,224,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
