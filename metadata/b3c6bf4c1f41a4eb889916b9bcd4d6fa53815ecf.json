For the majority of its career, the group consisted of three MCs and musicians Michael &quot;Mike D&quot; Diamond (vocals, drums), Adam &quot;MCA&quot; Yauch (vocals, bass) and Adam &quot;Ad-Rock&quot; Horovitz (vocals, guitar).\n\nOriginally formed as a four-piece hardcore punk band in 1981 by Diamond (vocals), John Berry (guitar), Yauch (bass) and Kate Schellenbach (drums), the band appeared on the compilation cassette New York Thrash, before recording their first EP Polly Wog Stew, in 1982. After achieving moderate local success with the 1983 experimental hip hop 12-inch &quot;Cooky Puss&quot;, the group made their transition to hip hop in 1984 and released a string of successful singles.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3c6bf4c1f41a4eb889916b9bcd4d6fa53815ecf","amp;dn":"Beastie+Boys-Hello+Nasty+1998+..320kbps+%28stPaddy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3c6bf4c1f41a4eb889916b9bcd4d6fa53815ecf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,198,191,76,31,65,164,235,136,153,22,185,188,212,214,250,83,129,94,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
