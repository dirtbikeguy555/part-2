Using MATLAB, you can analyze data, develop:\n : algorithms, and create models and applications. The language, tools, and   :\n : built-in math functions enable you to explore multiple approaches and reach:\n : a solution faster than with spreadsheets or traditional programming        :\n : languages, such as C/C++ or Java.                                          :\n :                                                                            :\n : MATLAB Differential Equations introduces you to the MATLAB language with   :\n : practical hands-on instructions and results, allowing you to quickly       :\n : achieve your goals. In addition to giving an introduction to the MATLAB    :\n : environment and MATLAB programming, this book provides all the material    :\n : needed to work on differential equations using MATLAB. It includes         :\n : techniques for solving ordinary and partial differential equations of      :\n : various kinds, and systems of such equations, either symbolically or using :\n : numerical methods (EulerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s method, HeunÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s method, the Taylor series method,:\n : the RungeÃ¢â‚¬â€œKutta method,Ã¢â‚¬Â¦). It also describes how to implement mathematical :\n : tools such as the Laplace transform, orthogonal polynomials, and special   :\n : functions (Airy and Bessel functions), and find solutions of finite        :\n : difference equations","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab9637c113b8cc9b823dc9e4e2423f28216ab679","amp;dn":"Apress+MATLAB+Differential+Equations+2014+Retail+eBook-BitBook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab9637c113b8cc9b823dc9e4e2423f28216ab679","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,150,55,193,19,184,204,155,130,61,201,228,226,66,63,40,33,106,182,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
