The earlier single, &quot;Something About You&quot; was their most successful\r\nsingle in the United States, reaching number 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\r\n\r\nAfter much success as a live and studio band in the 1980s, Level 42's commercial profile\r\ndiminished during the early 1990s following a series of personnel changes and musical\r\nshifts. After disbanding in 1994, the band reformed in 2001\r\n\r\n\r\nDisc 1\r\n\r\n1 - Hot Water [04:42]\r\n2 - Love Games [06:18]\r\n3 - Sooner Or Later [04:30]\r\n4 - Why Are You Leaving?
