Authors David R. Shaffer and Katherine Kipp provide you with a current and comprehensive overview of child and adolescent development, written in clear, concise language that talks &quot;to&quot; you rather than &quot;at&quot; you. The authors also focus on application--showing how theories and research apply to real-life settings. As a result, you will gain an understanding of developmental principles that will help you in your roles as parents, teachers, nurses, day-care workers, pediatricians, psychologists, or in any other capacity by which you may one day influence the lives of developing persons.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 784 pages\n# Publisher: Wadsworth Publishing; 8 edition (January 13, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0495601713\n# ISBN-13: 978-0495601715\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5021e10b3fa2c65b417383e93406ed43992ba646","amp;dn":"Developmental+Psychology%3AChildhood%2CAdolescence+%2C8th+Ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5021e10b3fa2c65b417383e93406ed43992ba646","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,33,225,11,63,162,198,91,65,115,131,233,52,6,237,67,153,43,166,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
