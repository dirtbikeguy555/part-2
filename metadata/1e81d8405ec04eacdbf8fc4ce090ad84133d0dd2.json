The cuddly, mainstream-pop version of New York drag culture (frontwoman Lady Miss Kier was essentially a female drag queen) and deep club music, they stayed faithful to their pancultural, pansexual, musically omnivorous dance-utopian roots throughout their too-brief career. Even their biggest hit, the agelessly potent suite &quot;Groove Is in the Heart,&quot; sounds like a bunch of unrelated ideas (a Herbie Hancock riff, a Q-Tip rap, cartoon P-Funk cameos, and a cutup diva-house vocal) that bumped into each other and decided to have a party. They were never less than sweet, and rarely less than kittenish--or, as Kier put it, &quot;De-groovy!&quot; Compiled by the band themselves, Very Best is a curious cross section of their career, omitting a couple of singles from Infinity Within and including more songs from their uneven farewell Dewdrops in the Garden than from their hit debut World Clique. They do get points, though, for rescuing the kicking Masters at Work collaboration &quot;Bittersweet Loving,&quot; whose straightforward four-on-the-floor points out how eccentric their beats and production usually were.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Deee-Lite Theme\n[02] Good Beat\n[03] Groove Is In The Heart\n[04] What Is Love?\n[05] E.S.P.\n[06] Power Of Love\n[07] Who Was That?\n[08] I Had A Dream I Was Falling Through A Hole In The Ozone Layer\n[09] Heart Be Still\n[10] Pussycat Meow\n[11] Love Is Everything\n[12] Say Ahhh...\n[13] Somebody\n[14] Bring Me Your Love\n[15] Mind Melt\n[16] Apple Juice Kissing\n[17] Picnic In The Summertime\n[18] Stay In Bed, Forget The Rest\n[19] Bittersweet Loving\n[20] Party Happening People\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 01h:15m:43s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 189mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v.9.0.0.70 MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Electronica Dance Pop\nRelease Date\t&gt; 06 November 2001\nRecord Company\t&gt; Electra Rhino Entertainment Warner Music\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deee-Lite#Discography \n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.ilike.com/artist/Deee-Lite \n&gt; http://www.ladykier.com/ \n&gt;\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e81d8405ec04eacdbf8fc4ce090ad84133d0dd2","amp;dn":"%5B2001%5D+The+Very+Best+Of+-+Deee-Lite+189mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e81d8405ec04eacdbf8fc4ce090ad84133d0dd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,129,216,64,94,192,78,172,219,248,252,76,224,144,173,132,19,61,13,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
