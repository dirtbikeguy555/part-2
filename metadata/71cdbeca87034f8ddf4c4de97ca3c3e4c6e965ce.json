The core issue at the heart of strategy, the author notes, is whether it is possible to manipulate and shape our environment rather than simply become the victim of forces beyond one's control. Time and again, Freedman demonstrates that the inherent unpredictability of this environment-subject to chance events, the efforts of opponents, the missteps of friends-provides strategy with its challenge and its drama. Armies or corporations or nations rarely move from one predictable state of affairs to another, but instead feel their way through a series of states, each one not quite what was anticipated, requiring a reappraisal of the original strategy, including its ultimate objective. Thus the picture of strategy that emerges in this book is one that is fluid and flexible, governed by the starting point, not the end point. \n\n A brilliant overview of the most prominent strategic theories in history, from David's use of deception against Goliath, to the modern use of game theory in economics, this masterful volume sums up a lifetime of reflection on strategy.\n\nOxford \n752 pages\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71cdbeca87034f8ddf4c4de97ca3c3e4c6e965ce","amp;dn":"Strategy%3A+A+History+%282013%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71cdbeca87034f8ddf4c4de97ca3c3e4c6e965ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,205,190,202,135,3,79,141,223,76,77,233,124,163,195,228,198,233,101,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
