Thomas (David Hemmings) is a nihilistic, wealthy fashion photographer in mod &quot;Swinging London.&quot; Filled with ennui, bored with his &quot;fab&quot; but oddly-lifeless existence of casual sex and drug use, Thomas comes alive when he wanders through a park, stops to take pictures of a couple embracing, and upon developing the images, believes that he has photographed a murder. Pursued by Jane (Vanessa Redgrave), the woman who is in the photos, Thomas pretends to give her the pictures, but in reality, he passes off a different roll of film to her. Thomas returns to the park and discovers that there is, indeed, a dead body lying in the shrubbery: the gray-haired man who was embracing Jane. Has she murdered him, or does Thomas' photo reveal a man with a gun hiding nearby? Antonioni's thriller is a puzzling, existential, adroitly-assembled masterpiece.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Blowup.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 51mn\n      Bit rate : 1736 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Custom\n      PlayTime : 1h 51mn\n      Bit rate : 1248 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 368 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 16/9\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.221\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 1h 51mn\n      Bit rate : 142 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Writing library : Gogo (after 3.0)\n   Audio #2\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 1h 51mn\n      Bit rate : 158 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Writing library : Gogo (after 3.0)\n   Audio #3\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 1h 51mn\n      Bit rate : 32 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Writing library : Lame 3.97\n   Audio #4\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 1h 51mn\n      Bit rate : 120 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Writing library : Xing (new)\n\nIMDB: tt0060176\n\nEnglish anf French audio, English, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16103566fdc15884eb304d6664293cdb19cadcb1","amp;dn":"Blow-Up+%281966%29+-++Michelangelo+Antonioni","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16103566fdc15884eb304d6664293cdb19cadcb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,16,53,102,253,193,88,132,235,48,77,102,100,41,60,219,25,202,220,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
