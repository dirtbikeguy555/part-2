For his literary contributions, Bellow was awarded the Pulitzer Prize (1975), the Nobel Prize for Literature (1976), and the National Medal of Arts (1988).  He is the only writer to have won the National Book Award for Fiction three times and he received the Foundation's lifetime Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters in 1990.\n\nIn the words of the Swedish Nobel Committee, his writing exhibited &quot;the mixture of rich picaresque novel and subtle analysis of our culture, of entertaining adventure, drastic and tragic episodes in quick succession interspersed with philosophic conversation, all developed by a commentator with a witty tongue and penetrating insight into the outer and inner complications that drive us to act, or prevent us from acting, and that can be called the dilemma of our age.&quot;\n\n\nWith the two exceptions noted below, the following books are in EPUB format (of varying quality):\n\n* THE ADVENTURES OF AUGIE MARCH (1953; Odyssey, 2012)\n\n* THE BELLAROSA CONNECTION (Penguin, 1989) -- PDF\n\n* COLLECTED STORIES (Viking, 2001) -- EPUB + PDF\n\n* HENDERSON THE RAIN KING (1959; Fawcett Crest, 1965)\n\n* HERZOG (1964; Fawcett Crest, 1965)\n\n* HUMBOLDT'S GIFT (Viking, 1975)\n\n* LETTERS [edited by Benjamin Taylor] (Viking, 2010)\n\n* MR.
