The CIAâ€™s own headquarters should be the safest spot on the planet, but a highly professional, violently psychopathic assassin, who hideously disfigures his victims, strikes without mercy.\r\nThe murders spread from Langley to a prison outside of Athens, where the first clue to what will become the End Game surfaces. A code carved into four copper panels of the legendary statue in a courtyard at CIA headquarters, known as Kryptos, predicts the means and the terrible necessity for the serial killings.\r\nBefore the first Iraq war, something horrifying was buried in the foothills above the oil city of Kirkuk. It will not remain buried forever.\r\nOnly Kirk McGarvey, Pete Boylan, and the CIAâ€™s odd-duck genius, Otto Rencke, can find the truth still buried in Iraq. A truth so devastating it could well ignite the entire Middle East into an unstoppable, apocalyptic war.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e1212d7bf81f4730fdf0a3d66a6d289cc4f338c","amp;dn":"End+Game+-+David+Hagberg+%5BEN+EPUB+MOBI%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e1212d7bf81f4730fdf0a3d66a6d289cc4f338c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,18,18,215,191,129,244,115,15,223,10,61,102,166,210,137,204,79,51,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
