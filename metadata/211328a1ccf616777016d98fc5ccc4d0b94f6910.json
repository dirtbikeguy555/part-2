The high mountain ranges of the Alps, the coastal waters of the Brittany, the chestnut forests of the Cevnnes, the caves and gorges of the Ardeche, the wet-lands of Camargue and the rolling lavender plains of Provence's unique maquis landscape. Across the series Ray explores the dramatic physical geography of each region; its topography, its climate and its extreme weather conditions. He tracks down and identifies the key wildlife species that live there and how they have adapted. He introduces us to animals with an ancient history with the land such as wolves and vultures as well as more unexpected and exotic wildlife such as pink flamingos and dolphins.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  Vanoise \r\nRay Mears visits The Vanoise National Park in the high Alps. Here he meets local goat herder Audrey who enlists his help moving her goats up to summer pastures. He explores the seasonal nature of the mountain and how humans and wildlife have adapted to the altitude and extremes of weather. He meets local park ranger Alex who take him up to see some ibex. He gets up close to see ibex jousting and hopping down the sheer cliff faces. Further up the mountain he enlists the help of donkeys to carry his kit. During his trek Ray comes across playful marmots, enjoying the sunshine before making his way to the very top of the mountain to find one of the rarest birds in Europe, the bearded vulture.\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0f/Wild-France-With-Mears-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/76/Wild-France-With-Mears-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d2/Wild-France-With-Mears-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/19/Wild-France-With-Mears-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f5/Wild-France-With-Mears-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a0/Wild-France-With-Mears-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d3/Wild-France-With-Mears-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0d/Wild-France-With-Mears-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/38/Wild-France-With-Mears-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/af/Wild-France-With-Mears-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a2/Wild-France-With-Mears-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9b/Wild-France-With-Mears-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4f/Wild-France-With-Mears-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/96/Wild-France-With-Mears-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e6/Wild-France-With-Mears-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/92/Wild-France-With-Mears-Screen15.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/03/Wild-France-With-Mears-Screen16.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video: Bitrate: CRF-21 (~4411 Kbps)\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 24 mins,\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 704 MB average\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:211328a1ccf616777016d98fc5ccc4d0b94f6910","amp;dn":"Wild+France+With+Ray+Mears+1of6+Vanoise+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"211328a1ccf616777016d98fc5ccc4d0b94f6910","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,19,40,161,204,246,22,119,112,22,217,143,197,204,196,208,185,79,105,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
