Becoming known as the &quot;Sleepover Bandits&quot;, the two kidnap bank managers the night before their robbery, spend the night with their families, and then all go to the bank in the morning to get the dough. Using a dim-witted stunt man as their getaway driver and lookout, the three successfully pull off several jobs that gets them recognition on a TV show about America's criminals. When a bored housewife with a failing marriage decides to runaway, she ends up in the hands of the criminals. Initially attracted to Willis, she nonetheless also ends up in bed with Thornton and a confused romantic relationship begins. Continuing along with their spree, the bandits hit the wall when the bank managers realize that they are non-violent and therefore no threat to them or their employees.
