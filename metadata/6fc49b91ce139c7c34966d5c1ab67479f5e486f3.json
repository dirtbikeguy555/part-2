Unlike Sun Tzu or Carl von Clausewitz, Napoleon never wrote a unified essay on his military philosophy. Yet, as one of the world's great strategists and tacticians, he sprinkled wisdom throughout his many and varied writings. Jay Luvaas spent over three decades poring through the thirty-two volumes of Napoleon's correspondence, carefully translating and editing all of his writings on the art of war, and arranging them into seamless essays. The resulting book captures the brilliant commander's thoughts on everything from the preparation of his forces to the organization, planning, and execution of his battles â€“ all buttressing Napoleon's view that &quot;in war there is but one favorable moment; the great art is to seize it.&quot; Napoleon on the Art of War will be essential reading for military buffs, students of history, and any business leader looking for timeless insights on strategy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fc49b91ce139c7c34966d5c1ab67479f5e486f3","amp;dn":"Napoleon+on+The+Art+of+War+%28History%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fc49b91ce139c7c34966d5c1ab67479f5e486f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,196,155,145,206,19,156,124,52,150,109,92,26,182,116,121,245,228,134,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
