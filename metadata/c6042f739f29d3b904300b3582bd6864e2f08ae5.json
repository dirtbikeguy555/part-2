Instead of using text commands, Minitab prefer a completely visual style of analysis.\nThe number of tests and graphs Minitab offers you is remarkable. Besides the traditional descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis, Minitab offers a menu of quality tools for time series and another one dedicated to the power and sample size.\nEach test is run on the data in a spreadsheet easy to edit, and the parameters are defined through dialog boxes. All the results you get will be available in the project window, in which you can integrate into a single report using ReportPad.\nMinitab is a statistical software more intuitive and powerful. However, compared with SPSS or JMP, suffers from a more outdated and the lack of a powerful syntax editor.\n\nSystem Requirements\n\n     Operating system - both 32 and 64 bit XP, Vista, or Windows 7\n     RAM - 512 MB (minimum), 1 + GB (recommended)\n     Processor - Pentium 4 or equivalent\n\nHard disk space:\n\n     Multiple users - 140 MB (minimum) free space available\n     A user - 160 MB (minimum) free space available\n     Language Pack - 55 MB of additional space Language Pack installed\n\nScreen resolution - 1024 x 768 or higher\nAdobe Ã‚Â® Reader - Requires version 5.0 or higher for Meet Minitab\n===========================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6042f739f29d3b904300b3582bd6864e2f08ae5","amp;dn":"Minitab+v16.2.3+%5BMulti%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6042f739f29d3b904300b3582bd6864e2f08ae5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,4,47,115,159,41,211,185,4,48,11,53,130,189,104,100,226,240,138,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
