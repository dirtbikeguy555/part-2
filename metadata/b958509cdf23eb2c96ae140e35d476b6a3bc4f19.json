In this Marvel Graphic Novel, a powerful mystic summons other magic gatherers for a rare contest to determine the most powerful sorcerer on earth. Both Doctors Strange and Doom attend, with a somewhat expected result yet with unexpected consequences. In the end, both must team up for a quest that is extremely personal for Victor von Doom - finally freeing his mother from the clutches of Mephisto in the netherworld. Will they both be up to the task? This amazing book is written by the legendary Roger Stern with art by a then up-and-coming Mike Mignola (of Hellboy fame). Please seed and I hope you enjoy this one very much! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b958509cdf23eb2c96ae140e35d476b6a3bc4f19","amp;dn":"Dr.+Strange+and+Dr.+Doom+-+Triumph+and+Torment+%281989%2C+Bchry-DCP%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b958509cdf23eb2c96ae140e35d476b6a3bc4f19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,88,80,156,223,35,235,44,150,174,20,14,53,212,118,182,163,188,79,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
