KONTAKT 5 takes a bold leap forward with 37 new filters, \n\nfour new on-board studio effects, updated time stretching, a new instrument bus system and more. As you will see from the newSTUDIO DRUMMER, for example, it's a deep-rooted \n\nupdate to the KONTAKT platform, allowing us ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and you ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ to create even better instruments and more powerful, expressive sounds. \n\nKONTAKT 5 delivers a number of large-scale enhancements, extending the creative power of the industry standard sampler further than ever before. \n\nNew pro effects\nSOLID G-EQ* \nAn authentic re-interpretation of a classic studio effectÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a uniquely clean and musical 4-band EQ switchable to shelf on the low and high bands, plus two full parametric \n\nmid-bands. \n\nSOLID BUS COMP* \nAlso available as a fully-fledged product in its own right, this virtual reproduction of a legendary compressor adds presence and drive without blurring the detail. Though \n\ntraditionally used to &quot;glue a mix together&quot;, it's not just for bus compression! \n\nTRANSIENT MASTER* \nAnother premium-grade effect, also available separately ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ TRANSIENT MASTER is an incredibly musical and versatile tool for re-shaping any kind of percussive sound. Make a \n\nsound hit harder, or shorten the resonance tail of a sound that rings too long. Bring instruments to the front of the mix or smooth out spikiness. \n\nTAPE SATURATOR \nBy simulating the natural, harmonic compression of analog tape, the TAPE SATURATOR adds a pleasing warmth to your sound. And pushed a little harder, it delivers a smooth, \n\norganic overdrive. \n\n* These pro-league effects are also available as fully fledged individual products - but you have them already included here in KONTAKT 5.\n\n37 New Filters\nKONTAKT 5 enhances your creative sound design palette with 37 new, high-quality filters, developed by the creative mastermind behind MASSIVE. The range covers the whole \n\nspectrum from classic state variable low-pass filters to avant-garde formant filters, and nine of the new additions employ groundbreaking adaptive resonance technology. These \n\n'AR' filters manage resonance peaks automatically ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ like an intelligent limiter inside the instrument ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ to avoid sudden harshness, unpleasant volume bursts, and unwanted \n\ndistortion. \n\nVintage Sampling Modes\nKONTAKT 5 offers vintage sample modes, straight from the MPC school of beatmaking. These re-create the unique sound and feel of the MPC60 and the SP1200, and are authentic \n\nenough to bring a nostalgic tear to the eyes of veteran beatheads everywhere. The algorithms used come from MASCHINE.\n\nAdvanced Time-Streching\nAn important addition in KONTAKT 5 is the new Time Machine Pro algorithm*, providing super-high-quality time-stretching ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ particularly suited to melodic and tonal material. \n\nUse Time Machine Pro for complete audio fidelity and imperceptible tempo-changes with all harmonic content intact. \n\nFeatures for Builders\n\n16 CHANNEL BUS SYSTEM \nThe new 16- bus system introduces comprehensive routing options with integrated insert and send effects. This is a powerful tool for creating detailed effects chains within an \n\ninstrument. For example, when building a drum kit, you might want to use completely different effects on the kick, toms and snare, while still sending the whole kit to a \n\nstereo master channel. Now you can. \n\nMIDI FILE SUPPORT \nKONTAKT 5 provides a new feature in the Kontakt script Processor: the MIDI file player. Useful for creating instruments that can play patterns, loops and grooves as opposed to \n\nsingle notes. As used in STUDIO DRUMMERÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s groove library, which provides over 3,500 exclusive beats and fills as production-ready MIDI patterns.\n\nASSiGN's Note\n\n* ABOUT THiS RELEASE * \n\nWe had a hard time with this latest big sampler, but finally it is fully unlocked again!
