Stealth of Nations opens up this underground realm, showing how the worldwide informal economy deals mostly in legal products and is, in fact, a ten-trillion-dollar industry, making it the second-largest economy in the world, after that of the United States.\n \nHaving penetrated this closed world and persuaded its inhabitants to open up to him, Robert Neuwirth makes clear that this informal method of transaction dates back as far as humans have existed and traded, that it provides essential services and crucial employment that fill the gaps in formal systems, and that this unregulated market works smoothly and effectively, with its own codes and unwritten rules.\n \nCombining a vivid travelogue with a firm grasp on global economic strategyÃ¢â‚¬â€along with a healthy dose of irreverence and skepticism toward conventional perceptionsÃ¢â‚¬â€Neuwirth gives us an eye-opening account of a world that is always operating around us, hidden in plain sight","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09851cb6630e31d71f1ee4cb447f4dfd7887e9c3","amp;dn":"Stealth+of+Nations%3A+The+Global+Rise+of+the+Informal+Economy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09851cb6630e31d71f1ee4cb447f4dfd7887e9c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,133,28,182,99,14,49,215,31,30,228,203,68,127,77,253,120,135,233,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
