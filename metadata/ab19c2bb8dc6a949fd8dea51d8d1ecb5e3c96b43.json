He has been dubbed the father of &quot;scientific history&quot; because of his strict standards of evidence-gathering and analysis in terms of cause and effect without reference to intervention by the gods.  Macaulay called him &quot;the greatest historian that ever lived.&quot;\n\nHis HISTORY OF THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR recounts the momentous struggle between Athens and Sparta that lasted for twenty-seven years from 431 to 404 BCE, involving virtually the whole of the Greek world and ending in the fall of Athens.  A participant in the war himself, Thucydides brings to his history an awesome intellect, brilliant narrative, and penetrating analysis of the nature of power, as it affects both states and individuals.  Considered essential reading for generals, statesmen, and liberally-educated citizens for more than 2,000 years, THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR is a mine of military, moral, political, and philosophical wisdom. \n\n\nThe following five translations are in PDF format unless otherwise indicated:\n\n* THE LANDMARK THUCYDIDES: A Comprehensive Guide to The Peloponnesian War (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1996).
