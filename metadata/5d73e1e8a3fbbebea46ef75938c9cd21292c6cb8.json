While it wasnt a huge success at first, it turned into what the film industry now terms a -sleeper- hit, gradually building acclaim and cult status as the years passed.\n\nBlade Runner was the movie that coined the marketing term -Directors Cut-, as well, and has been through five different iterations if you include the -Final- cut that has just been released for the twenty-fifth anniversary. A dark ambiguous tale of a near-future cyber-dystopia, based on a novel penned by one of the most influential science fiction writers of all time, Philip K. Dick, its a movie that has obviously retained a power to speak to audiences in a way that few films can lay claim to so long after their original creation.\n\nThe soundtrack is integral to the impact of any movie, and Blade Runner was no exception. Ridley Scott called in the services of Greek synthesiser supremo Vangelis, who created a dark and evocative audio backdrop that matched the cyberpunk-noir of the visuals perfectly, working in close collaboration with Scott and allegedly obsessing over minute detail.\n\nThat soundtrack never saw official commercial release until the first Director's Cut in 1994 ÃƒÂ¢?? but there were numerous bootleg releases both before and after. The Blade Runner Trilogy release collects all the disparate parts that never made it onto official product before (despite being in the movie itself), along with a few off-cut extras, and a whole disc of new material composed by Vangelis in homage to the film.\n\nThe first disc ÃƒÂ¢?? the original soundtrack release from 1994, polished up and digitally remastered ÃƒÂ¢?? contains no surprises for those familiar with the film. What is surprising, however, is how well it has aged. Certainly, the palette of sounds Vangelis paints with is a trifle dated, but in its execution rather than its style. The shape and tone of the synthetic instruments is similar to the noises used today, and it's only the lack of detail and sonic thickness ÃƒÂ¢?? the limitation of digital synths of the period ÃƒÂ¢?? that betrays the era. \n\nThat said, the composition is very much of the age, and it shows through in the more dominant pieces ÃƒÂ¢?? the -Love Theme- still reeks of old-school saxophone schmaltz, for example. While probably meant as a homage to the noir movies that inspired Blade Runner, a younger listener will probably not click to the reference, hearing instead a very unfashionable ham-up.\n\nHowever, -Tales Of The Future- in keeping with its name, still sounds quite contemporary, a blending of electronica and ethnic prayer-call that is strangely relevant to our culturally mixed-up moment, a muezzin howl in a digital global village.\n\nBut with much of the soundtrack, you can easily forget youre listening to it at all unless you make a point of paying attention. Which is arguably part of the point of a good soundtrack - it shouldnt intrude, but embellish and bolster the atmosphere. Even divorced from its visual counterpart, theres something deeply alien and futuristic about it, even as it retains a very human and melodic core, perfectly mirroring the Blade Runner themes of humanities separation from itself (and from certainty) by the relentless march of technological progress.\n\nThe second disc adds to the collection the parts which werent released the first time, and arguably contains the more interesting material for students of modern musical history ÃƒÂ¢?? more abstract and ambient, the influence of these sounds and themes on modern producers can be discerned lurking at the back of the soundscape, biding their time before emerging into the muddy fields and frigid warehouses of the nineties chill-out scene.\n\nThe third disc contains Vangelis new material, and this is the disc that will probably be of little interest to anyone but Vangelis fans and obsessive completist collectors. It is here we can see Vangelis as a man still at the cutting edge of his field ÃƒÂ¢?? hes still a great composer and a consummate musician, but has moved on stylistically.\n\nThis may be purposeful on his part ÃƒÂ¢?? it is a collection of pieces to celebrate the movies anniversary in 2007 after all. Plus it also includes voice-over parts from (among others) Ridley Scott himself, and the infamous director Roman Polanski. \n\nThis is a beautifully packaged collection piece, and it's good to have the entire soundtrack publicly available for the first time. This will make the science fiction movie geek in your life a very happy person indeed.\n\nBy: Paul Raven\n\n\n\nTrack Listing:\n \nThe 1994 Soundtrack Album (Digitally Remastered)\n\n01.
