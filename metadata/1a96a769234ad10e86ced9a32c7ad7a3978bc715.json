And although the goofy TV movie may have been mostly Paul's baby, this album features the two 45 rpm masterpieces that sum up the quintessential best of Lennon and McCartney at this stage of their development: Paul's &quot;Penny Lane&quot; and John's &quot;I Am the Walrus.&quot; --Jim Emerson\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a96a769234ad10e86ced9a32c7ad7a3978bc715","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+Magical+Mystery+Tour","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a96a769234ad10e86ced9a32c7ad7a3978bc715","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,150,167,105,35,74,209,14,134,206,217,163,44,122,215,163,151,139,199,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
