Transfer your favorite shapes of older figures to the new Genesis figures. GenX2 may either transfer a complete character comprising several morphs as one combined morph, or it may transfer each single morph including all automated correction morphs, so you can work with the transferred morphs in your Genesis figure just as in the original figure. GenX2 also translates poses or expressions with morph values and morph injections or shaping presets to be used with the transferred morphs.
