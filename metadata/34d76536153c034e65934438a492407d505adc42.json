For animals there is just one goal in life--to continue their bloodline in the form of offspring. They are an animal's legacy for the future. The story of their journey is about hope, facing danger, actions of breath-taking boldness, extraordinary behaviours and, ultimately, success against the odds. \n\nThis spectacular series follows that journey through its six crucial stages: taking their first steps in the world, growing up, finding a home, gaining power, winning a mate and succeeding as a parent. Life Story brings a new level of story-telling to the landmark genre, creating an experience that is both intimate and intense. We follow the struggles and triumphs of individual animals, drawing the viewer into their worlds, to sense the danger, the challenges and the decisions they must face.\n\n\n\nPart: Courtship\n \nThe competition to breed has created both the most extraordinary beauty and the most violent battles seen in nature. Waved albatross pair for life and spend hours canoodling with each other. But for a male peacock jumping spider one wrong move in his dazzling courtship routine may well prove fatal.\nA male flame bowerbird creates a stick sculpture decorated with shells and berries to impress a mate. Even that isn't enough. He then uses it as a backdrop to show off his vivid colours in a dazzling dance. But things don't go to plan as his bower is destroyed by mischievous youngsters and a rival male.\nBut the most extraordinary display of all is created by a tiny, drab male pufferfish. He builds a spectacular submarine 'crop circle' in the sand. It's the most perfect and complex structure created by any animal. The crop circles were only discovered in southern Japan in 1995 and the fish architect was only identified in 2011.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p026vg04&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p026vg04&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs \nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;347c5d535c7478001a05&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nVideo Bitrate: 3029 Kbps \nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\nVideo Resolution: 1280 x 720\nAudio Codec: AAC LC\nAudio English \nAudio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\nAudio Channels: Stereo 2\nRun-Time: 59mins\nFramerate: 25 FPS\nNumber of Parts: 6\nContainer Mp4\nPart Size: 1.31 GB\nSource: HDrip\nEncoded by: Harry65 \n\nRelease Notes\nMerged Subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34d76536153c034e65934438a492407d505adc42","amp;dn":"BBC.Life.Story.5of6.Courtship.720p.HDrip.x264.AAC..mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34d76536153c034e65934438a492407d505adc42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,215,101,54,21,60,3,78,101,147,68,56,164,146,64,125,80,90,220,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
