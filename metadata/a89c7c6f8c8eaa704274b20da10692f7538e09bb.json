Elton was no stranger to this amazing auditorium; he had already performed his hit show, The Red Piano, 243 times in this arena. This is by a mile the most shows he has performed in one venue. Created and designed by David LaChapelle, The Red Piano debuted at The Colosseum on February 14, 2004. It was originally booked for 75 shows over three years, but the agreement was soon extended, and the final Red Piano show took place five years later on April 22, 2009.\n On September 23, 2011, Elton celebrated his ruby Las Vegas anniversary Ã¢â‚¬â€ 40 years since he first played there Ã¢â‚¬â€ with the debut of the astonishing new show, The Million Dollar Piano. Aside from his band, Davey Johnstone (guitars and vocals), Nigel Olsson (drums and vocals), the late Bob Birch (bass), John Mahon (percussion and vocals) and Kim Bullard (keyboards) plus 2CELLOS (Stjepan Hauser and Luka Sulic), backing vocalists Rose Stone, Tata Vega, Jean Witherspoon and Lisa Stone, and percussionist Ray Cooper, Elton shared the stage with another shining star Ã¢â‚¬â€ The Million Dollar Piano. This unique instrument, created especially for Elton by Yamaha, is an engineering marvel. It features more than 68 LED video screens, and took nearly four years to construct. The piano is the perfect accompaniment to EltonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music, displaying imagery to complement his greatest hits, such as Bennie And The Jets, Rocket Man, Saturday NightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Alright (For Fighting) and Circle of Life. This onstage line-up, never before seen at an Elton John concert, heralded EltonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s three-year residency at The Colosseum, with Creative Direction by Mark Fisher and Patrick Woodroffe.\n At the time Elton declared, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Caesars Palace is just a perfect idyllic place to play, and the show will be a gargantuan feast of music and imagery. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m going to have a fabulous piano that Yamaha have been working on for four years, and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the reason why the show is called The Million Dollar Piano.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n Reviews from the first night of The Million Dollar Piano were a delight to read. The Las Vegas Sun writer Robin Leach reviewed The Million Dollar Piano in glowing terms, concluding that the show left him, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ã¢â‚¬Â¦deliriously happy and thrilledÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and making this prediction: Ã¢â‚¬Å“DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be at all surprised if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a total sellout with the three-year term quickly expanding to five. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t run to the box office Ã¢â‚¬â€ race there. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be talking about The Million Dollar Piano for years to come. Simply put, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one epic masterpiece of musical entertainment.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n The LA Times reviewer noticed that, Ã¢â‚¬Å“To fully appreciate the spectacle that is Elton JohnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new show The Million Dollar Piano at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, you have to pay attention to the details, such as the jumbo piano-roll swirls that flank the piano player and change colors throughout the night, shifting from gold to ruby to emerald to sapphire. Not that you can miss them. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re the size of stretch SUVs. Or the pair of cocker spaniel bas-reliefs tucked at the base of another set piece, representing JohnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s two canine companions, which sit beneath a handful of cupids leaning on a ledge and peering down amid bountiful grapevines. Or the tennis-court-sized screen behind John and his five-piece core band, which displays dozens of animated backdrops to accompany the songs, moving from glowing sunsets and spinning candelabras to carnival scenes to live-action clips of John throughout the years in many ridiculous outfits.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nTrack Listing\n\n01.
