I don't think they were meant to be a big multi-million dollar phenomenon. nevertheless, Houdini was a kick-ass, weird, demented, rock album and is probably the best of their career (next to their self-titled album). in my opinion, this is probably one of the best rock albums that came out that year. when I think of my favorite albums of '93 I think of: Tool - Undertow, Tad - Inhaler, and Melvins - Houdini.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nMelvins - Houdini\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Melvins\nAlbum................: Houdini\nGenre................: Alternative Metal\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1993\n\nMP3 V0 (Highest Quality Available For MP3)\n\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Extreme, (avg. bitrate: 259kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
