With amazing art by Lee Bermejo, you surely don't want to miss this one. Especially great in the face of the recent &quot;Death of the Family&quot; storyline. Thanks to Archangel + Zone-Empire for this digital copy, please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:370846b61ac2bf3d53fa88c0bc44595f98cd31c3","amp;dn":"Joker+%282008%2C+GN%2C+Digital%2C+Archangel+%2B+Zone-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"370846b61ac2bf3d53fa88c0bc44595f98cd31c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,8,70,182,26,194,191,61,83,250,136,192,188,68,89,95,152,205,49,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
