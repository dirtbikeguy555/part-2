Mercy Falls Hospital has been in operation for nearly \na hundred years, but now the authorities have declared it unfit for human \ninhabitation. As a result, the time has come for the hospital to close. But \njust as the helicopters arrive to transport the children to a new facility, \nbad weather forces them to remain grounded. Later, as Nurse Amy (Calista \nFlockhart) tends to her young charges, the children's bones begin to \nfracture for no apparent reason. Though the doctors remain baffled by the \ninexplicable injuries, the children sense something that the grown-ups do \nnot. Somewhere in these crumbling corridors lurks a force of darkness \nconsumed by pain, and filled with hatred. The children have dubbed it The \nMechanical Girl, and they claim to have stolen glimpses of it sobbing in \nthe shadows. In order to banish the spirit and save the children, one brave \nsoul will have to summon the courage to face a force powerful enough to \ncause physical damage, yet so fragile it might be completely destroyed \nby the slightest touch.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Calista Flockhart.\n=&gt;-Richard Roxburgh.\n=&gt;-Elena Anaya.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Jaume Balaguero.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Horror : Mystery : Thriller.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 2005.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.31 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 926 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 37 mn.\n=&gt;-Fragile A Ghost Story 2005.: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0422272/\n=&gt;-Fragile A Ghost Story 2005.: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fragiles-fragile/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 2.35:1.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 544.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1 810 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 223 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25a75a54fb13405e6e267529e38415b71f1de789","amp;dn":"Fragile+A+Ghost+Story+-+Horror+Thriller+2005+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH246","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25a75a54fb13405e6e267529e38415b71f1de789","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,167,90,84,251,19,64,94,110,38,117,41,227,132,21,183,31,29,231,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
