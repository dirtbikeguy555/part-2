[11] The hearings had to be posponed on July 10, 2008, because one of the prosecution's witnesses was unable to attend due to pregnancy.[12] The DNA tests were &quot;inconclusive&quot;.[13] On July 22, 2008, the charges against Landron were dropped by the prosecution, after several inconsistencies appeared in the witness accounts.[14]\n[edit] Future\n\nDon Omar has confirmed the name of he's new upcoming album titled Prototype 2.0, confimed by Latin bites; Daddy Yankee will be singing a duo with Don Omar in this upcoming album.\n[edit] Discography\nMain article: Don Omar discography\n\n    * 2003: The Last Don\n    * 2006: King of Kings\n    * 2009: iDon\n    * 2010: Prototype 2.0 (Re-released of iDon)\n\n     Other albums\n\n    * 2004: The Last Don Live (Live album)\n    * 2005: Don Omar Presenta: Los Bandoleros (Compilation album)\n    * 2005: Da Hitman Presents ReggaetÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n Latino (Compilation album)\n    * 2006: Don Omar Presenta: Los Bandoleros Reloaded (Compilation album)\n    * 2006: King Of Kings: Armageddon Edition (Re-edition album)\n    * 2007: Don Omar Presenta: El PentÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡gono (Compilation album)\n    * 2007: King Of Kings Live (Live album)\n\n     Filmography\nYear \tTitle \tRole\n2009 \tFast &amp; Furious \tRico[15][16]\n2009 \tLos Bandoleros \tSantos","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2663d54f10cf63956003917ac91864198d1e8a7f","amp;dn":"Don.Omar.Discography-DeathTeam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2663d54f10cf63956003917ac91864198d1e8a7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,99,213,79,16,207,99,149,96,3,145,122,201,24,100,25,141,30,138,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
