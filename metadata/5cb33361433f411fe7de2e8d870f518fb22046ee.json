Released in October 2003, this album follows up 2001's Is This It and includes three singles &quot;12:51&quot;, &quot;Reptilia&quot; and &quot;The End Has No End&quot;. Grammy-winning producer Nigel Godrich (Radiohead, Travis, Beck) was initially tapped to produce Room on Fire, but the Strokes felt that he made the songs seem &quot;soulless&quot;, and so they went back to Is This It producer Gordon Raphael. Although Room On Fire received warm reviews upon release and reached #2 in the UK and debuted at #4 on the Billboard 200, going gold, the album's eventual US sales were less than Is This It's 1 million units, with 597,000 sales and certified gold in the US as of October 2006.\n\nTrack Listing\n1 - What Ever Happened?\n2 - Reptilia\n3 - Automatic Stop\n4 - 12:51\n5 - You Talk Way Too Much\n6 - Between Love &amp; Hate\n7 - Meet Me In The Bathroom\n8 - Under Control\n9 - The Way It Is\n10 - The End Has No End\n11 - I Can't Win\n\nAll tracks are DRM-free and encoded losslessly in FLAC format (16 bit, stereo, 44.1 kHz).
