The band reached an apex of popularity in the 1970s during the funk and disco era and with the advent of rap and hip-hop, has enjoyed an enthusiastic renaissance since the mid-1990s.\nThe influence of the Ohio Players is obvious in the music of the 1990s. Their songs have been heavily sampled by West Coast rap and hip-hop groups, most notably Dr. Dre and his &quot;G-Funk&quot; sound. Primus, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Soundgarden have all borrowed stylistically from the Ohio Players, and Soundgarden covered their single &quot;Fopp&quot; note for note.\n\n\n\nThis CD has all of the songs of &quot;Gold&quot; with the exception of &quot;Only a Child could Love&quot;. Plus six more songs including one of their hits &quot;O-H-I-O&quot;. (Gold was originally released before &quot;O-H-I-O came out) \nAlso 7 of the songs are tracks from hard to find out-of-print albums (four are included on the &quot;Funk on Fire&quot; Anthology, however). \nHowever, the version of &quot;Love Rollercoaster&quot; is the shorter (single version I guess) than the one on Funk Anthology.
