A Beautiful Bastard: The Union army may be full of bastards, but thereâ€™s only one big enough to think he can save the day single-handed when the Gurkish come calling: the incomparable Colonel Sand dan Glokta.\r\n\r\n2. Made a Monster: After years of bloodshed, the idealistic chieftain Bethod is desperate to bring peace to the North. Thereâ€™s only one obstacle left â€“ his own lunatic champion.\r\n\r\n3. Small Kindnesses: The hopes of Shevedieh, the best thief in Westport, to turn her back on crime, come crashing down when she finds a huge drunkard sleeping in her doorway. Doing the right thing always comes at a priceâ€¦\r\n\r\n4. The Fool Jobs: Curnden Craw has been sent with his dozen to recover a thing from beyond the Crinna. One small problem. No one seems to know what the thing is.\r\n\r\n5. Skipping Town: Shevedieh and Javre, ill-matched adventurers, find themselves forced to flee yet another self-made disaster.\r\n\r\n6. Hell: â€˜I have seen hell, and it is a great city under siege.â€™ The fall of Dagoska through the eyes of a young acolyte.\r\n\r\n7. Twoâ€™s Company: Javre, Lioness of Hoskopp, runs into Cracknut Whirrun on a bridge over a remote canyon. Can Shevedieh persuade either of these proud heroes to step aside?\r\n\r\n8. Wrong Place, Wrong Time: Three not entirely innocent bystanders are sucked into the chaos of Monzcarro Murcattoâ€™s vengeance.\r\n\r\n9. Some Desperado: There is no honour among thieves when the outlaw Smoke finds herself being hunted down by her own comrades.\r\n\r\n10. Yesterday, Near a Village Called Barden: Royal Observer Bremer dan Gorst reports to the king on another ugly little skirmish as summer dies in the North.\r\n\r\n11. Threeâ€™s a Crowd: Itâ€™s a foolish man who steals from the best thief in Styria, and when Horald the Finger steals her lover, itâ€™s time for Shevedieh to stop running and start fighting. For those who work in the shadows, though, few things are ever quite as they seemâ€¦\r\n\r\n12. Freedom: Being an absolutely true account of the liberation of the town of Averstock from the grip of the incorrigible rebel menace by the famous Nicomo Cosca.\r\n\r\n13. Tough Times all Over: All Carcolf wants is to take her package from here to there, but in the city of fogs and whispers, there are always a dozen other rogues with their own ideas.\r\n\r\nSharp Ends combines previously published, award-winning tales with exclusive new short stories. Violence explodes, treachery abounds, and the words are as deadly as the weapons in this rogue's gallery of side-shows, back-stories, and sharp endings from the world of the First Law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Steven Pacey\r\nFormat: MP3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f0017b8e5c4cc3aded4aeb33d22d7ffa8367c83","amp;dn":"Joe+Abercrombie+-+Sharp+Ends+%28First+Law+World+%237%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f0017b8e5c4cc3aded4aeb33d22d7ffa8367c83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,0,23,184,229,196,204,58,222,212,174,179,61,34,215,255,168,54,124,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
