Debuted in 2008, the High Kings are a supergroup comprised of Irish natives Finbarr Clancy (born in Carrick-an-Suir, County Tipperary; formerly of the Clancy Brothers), Martin Furey (born in Dunmore East, County Waterford; formerly of the group Bohinta), Brian Dunphy (born in Dublin; formerly a cast member of Riverdance), and Darren Holden (born in County Kilkenny; formerly a cast member of Riverdance, among other Broadway productions, and a successful solo artist as well). Their debut album, The High Kings, sold very well in the United States for world music (peaking at number 150 on the Billboard Top 200 albums chart and number two on the world music albums chart), thanks in significant part to a PBS television special (also released on DVD) broadcast nationally in commemoration of the St. Patrick's Day holiday. The High Kings subsequently toured their homeland.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tIrish Folk/International\t\nSource:\t\t\tWeb\nLabel:\t\t\tUniversal Music\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Step It Out Mary\n02.As I Roved Out\n03.The Fields Of Athenry\n04.On The One Road (Feat.
