The son of the famed film composer Maurice Jarre, he was born August 24, 1948, in Lyon, France, and began studying piano at the age of five. Abandoning classical music as a youth, Jarre became enamored of jazz before forming a rock band called Mystere IV; in 1968, he became a pupil of the musique concrÃƒÂ¨te pioneer Pierre Schaeffer, joining Groupe de Recherches Musicales. His early experiments in electro-acoustic music yielded the 1971 single &quot;La Cage&quot;; the full-length Deserted Palace followed a year later. \n\n\nGenre................: Electronic\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Dreyfus\nIncluded.............: Covers, auCDtect, Log, Cue\n\n\n01.OxygÃƒÂ¨ne, Part 4\n02.Zoolookologie\n03.Ãƒâ€°quinoxe, Part 4\n04.OxygÃƒÂ¨ne, Part 8\n05.C'est La Vie (Feat.
