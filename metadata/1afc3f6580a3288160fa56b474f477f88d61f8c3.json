Miller's Beds delineates nine projects; Barrett's Bookcases, 11. Both authors explain the basics of woodworking, safety issues, materials lists, cut lists, and measured drawings. And both emphasize process as much as result; the authors each weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the use of certain joints and joinery techniques, for example, and they explain a variety of different designs. Each volume is lavishly illustrated with photographs, line drawings, charts, and the like. The depth of this series makes it more useful than the recent &quot;HomeTime&quot; series. Highly recommended.AAlexander Hartmann, Bloomsburg Univ.
