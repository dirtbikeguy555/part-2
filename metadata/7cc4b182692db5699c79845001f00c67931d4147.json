More clean vocals are featured on the album than their debut album, Sounding the Seventh Trumpet. It is also the first album to feature Johnny Christ on bass, thus completing the band's primary lineup (until The Rev's death in 2009).\n\nThe album was released as 2x12&quot;, LP, Repress, 33 Ã¢â€¦â€œ RPM, Grey Marble on 2008 in US. The album was certified gold on July 15, 2009, even though it only sold 3,000 copies on its first week of release. Neilsen Soundscan reports that 552,869 copies have been sold as of November 2010. The song &quot;Eternal Rest&quot; appears on Kerrang's &quot;666 Songs You Must Own&quot;.\n\nThe only song on the record that does not contain screaming is &quot;I Won't See You Tonight (Part 1)&quot;. It is noteworthy that the band's first album, Sounding the Seventh Trumpet had three songs that were all clean vocals, &quot;To End the Rapture&quot;, &quot;Streets&quot; and &quot;Warmness on the Soul&quot;.\n\nAs with Sounding the Seventh Trumpet, most of the songs from this album are not usually performed live, although, &quot;Unholy Confessions&quot; has always been a staple to their set since the release of Waking the Fallen. The song &quot;Eternal Rest&quot; was featured on the Soundtrack to the movie Saw IV.\n\nReleased: August 26, 2003\nRecorded: 2003 at NRG Recordings in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California\nGenre: Metalcore\nLength: 68:33\nLabel: Hopeless\nProducer: Andrew Murdock and Fred Archambault\n\nList of songs:\n1. &quot;Waking the Fallen&quot;\n2. &quot;Unholy Confessions&quot;\n3. &quot;Chapter Four&quot;\n4. &quot;Remenissions&quot;   \n5. &quot;Desecrate Through Reverence&quot;   \n6. &quot;Eternal Rest&quot;\n7. &quot;Second Heartbeat&quot;\n8. &quot;Radiant Eclipse&quot;\n9. &quot;I Won't See You Tonight (Part 1)&quot;\n10.&quot;I Won't See You Tonight (Part 2)&quot;\n11. &quot;Clairvoyant Disease&quot;\n12. &quot;And All Things Will End&quot;\n\nDon't forget to seed and thank!\nCheck my other torrents, like &quot;Nightmare (2010) [Full Album 320 kbps] REMASTERED&quot;!!\n\nMrGonga","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cc4b182692db5699c79845001f00c67931d4147","amp;dn":"Avenged+Sevenfold+-+Waking+The+Fallen+%282003%29+%5BFull+Album+320+kbp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cc4b182692db5699c79845001f00c67931d4147","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,196,177,130,105,45,181,105,156,121,132,80,1,240,12,103,147,29,65,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
