Formed in late 2006 by producer Bobby Rifo, an international indie producer, and DJ Tommy Tea. Often compared with French band Justice, the duo wear Venom masks while performing. The duo had a short tour of the United States in early 2008, alongside DJ Steve Aoki. In 2008, their song &quot;Butter&quot; was included on the soundtrack for FIFA 09 and &quot;Mac Mac&quot; was featured in 2K Sports' NBA 2K9.\n\nRomborama is the title of the debut studio album by Italian electronic duo The Bloody Beetroots. It was released on 21 August 2009. Some tracks are taken from earlier Bloody Beetroots releases, for example &quot;Butter&quot; can also be found on the Rombo EP.\n\n* From Wikipedia\n\n__________________________________Tracks___________________________________________\n\n\n   1. &quot;Romborama&quot; (featuring All Leather)                3:42\n   2. &quot;Have Mercy on Us&quot; (featuring CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©cile)              5:47\n   3. &quot;Storm&quot;                                            3:44  \n   4. &quot;Awesome&quot; (featuring The Cool Kids)                2:34\n   5. &quot;Cornelius&quot;                                        4:13\n   6. &quot;It's Better a DJ on 2 Turntables&quot;                 3:47\n   7. &quot;Talkin' in My Sleep&quot; (featuring Lisa Kekaula)     5:28\n   8. &quot;2nd Streets Have No Name&quot; (featuring Beta Bow)    3:03\n   9. &quot;Butter&quot;                                           4:34\n  10. &quot;Warp 1.9&quot; (featuring Steve Aoki)                  3:23\n  11. &quot;Fucked from Above 1985&quot;                           3:22\n  12. &quot;Theolonius&quot; (The Voodoo King)                     4:45\n  13. &quot;Yeyo&quot; (featuring Raw Man)                         3:31\n  14. &quot;Little Stars&quot; (featuring Vicarious Bliss)         2:40\n  15. &quot;Warp 7.7&quot; (featuring Steve Aoki)                  3:50\n  16. &quot;Make Me Blank&quot; (featuring J*Davey)                3:51\n  17. &quot;House NÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â° 84&quot;                                      3:53\n  18. &quot;Mother&quot;                                           3:37\n  19. &quot;I Love the Bloody Beetroots&quot;                      5:28\n  20. &quot;Anacletus&quot;                                        3:15\n  21. &quot;Come La&quot; (featuring Marracash) (bonus track)      2:45\n\n\n\n_________________________________Track Info________________________________________\n\n\n\n                                  MPEG Audio File\n                                    (a.k.a mp3)\n\n                                  Bit rates vary \n             \n                                       256Kbps\n\n                           Album Artwork Should Be Included\n\n\n___________________________________.:END:._________________________________________\n\n\n                         Please Seed -&gt; Sharing is Caring\n\n\n                      [ CONSTRUCTIVE comments are appreciated ]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e7aab19b5efadad929435efabf20ad8deed1712","amp;dn":"Romborama+-+The+Bloody+Beetroots+%5B2009%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e7aab19b5efadad929435efabf20ad8deed1712","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,122,171,25,181,239,173,173,146,148,53,239,171,242,10,216,222,237,23,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
