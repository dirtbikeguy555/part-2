GraphiSoft ArchiCADâ€™s innovative BIM (building information model) solution helps you win more business while letting you concentrate on your core skill â€“ creating inspiring designs.\r\n\r\nArchiCAD 19 is now faster than ever! No more waiting for views to load. GraphiSoft has extended its robust 64- bit and multi-processing technologies with background processing â€” an industry first for BIM. So ArchiCAD now offers lightning-fast response times and this turbo-charged update to ArchiCAD makes it the undisputed speed leader in the BIM business.\r\n\r\nWhatâ€™s new in version 19.0.0.5005:\r\n\r\n- Background Processing - ArchiCAD 19 takes advantage of unused computer capacity by anticipating what you might do next &quot; and preparing those actions in the background. This &quot;second guessing&quot; greatly increases the overall responsiveness of the application, so it feels more agile with projects of any kind or size. Thatâ€™s the dramatic difference youâ€™ll feel between this next-gen technology and standard BIM software without background processing.\r\n- Improved Work Environment - ArchiCAD 19 provides major work environment improvements for both Mac and Windows users. Brand new Tab-based navigation makes accessing different views and overseeing the BIM project much easier. Plus, true full-screen mode makes ArchiCAD 19 feel like the most &quot;natural&quot; BIM application on the Mac.\r\n- Point-Cloud Support - ArchiCAD 19 reads the most common point-clouds, providing faster, error- free building surveys by using the latest 3D scanner laser-survey technology. This eliminates all errors due to manual data input while ensuring a lightning-fast, fully-automated, error-free workflow.\r\n- Productivity Enhancements - RCHICAD 19 makes the most time- consuming and often boring part of an architectâ€™s work much more fun. Now precise editing and accurate listing can be as easy as sketching your initial concept lines in pencil.\r\n- Leading the Way in Open BIM - Improved IFC-based collaboration and collision detection (using the MEP Modeler add-on) improves Open BIM collaboration between architects and engineers.\r\n- Interactive 3D Surface Painter - ArchiCADâ€™s new Surface Painter enables designers to change model surfaces in the 3D window with a single click, using a floating palette.\r\n- Smoother and Faster 3D Navigation - Better utilization of OpenGL means smooth and lightning-fast navigation - even on extremely large building models.\r\n\r\nMADE IN UKRAINE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcdb2d0b8977c3ae15670f66747d4cce6c9cb043","amp;dn":"ArchiCAD+19.0.0.5005+%5BMAC+OS+X%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcdb2d0b8977c3ae15670f66747d4cce6c9cb043","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,219,45,11,137,119,195,174,21,103,15,102,116,125,76,206,108,156,176,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
