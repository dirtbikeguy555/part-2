But one factor that continues to set him apart is the remarkable breadth found in his compositions and recordings. From classical to free jazz, to middle-eastern music to controlled-improvisation, to soundtracks and more, Zorn has nearly done it all. He has recorded in these styles on many different occasions with a variety of co-conspirators. Therefore, Simulacrum, featuring an aggressive organ trio, should surprise no one, despite being unlike much of his previous material.\n\nThe recording features John Medeski (Medeski, Martin, and Wood) on organ, Kenny Grohowski (Abraxas) on drums, and Matt Hollenberg (Cleric) on guitar. Zorn does not actually play, but is credited with composition and arrangements. Of the three instrumentalists, Hollenberg is well known in the heavy metal community, Grohowski to a lesser extent, and Medeski of course is a frequent Zorn collaborator and an established experimenter. Despite the trioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s varied background, Simulacrum arguably focuses on progressive metal (e.g., Fates Warning, Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, The Dillinger Escape Plan), 90Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s technical metal (e.g., Watchtower, Spastic Ink, Cynic, Atheist) and math rock with heavy riffing, busy double-bass drumming, and angular lines. In particular, if Medeski were replaced by a bassist, Simulacrum would be familiar territory.\n\nArtist: John Zorn\nTitle Of Album: Simulacrum\nYear Of Release: 2015\nLabel: Tzadik / 8330\nGenre: Jazz/Avant-Garde/Rock\nQuality: 320 Kbps\nTotal Time: 43:02 min\nTotal Size: 101 MB\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
