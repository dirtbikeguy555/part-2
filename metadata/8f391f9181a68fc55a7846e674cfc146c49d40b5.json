What you hear is what was played: there are no overdubs or digital studio fixes. They replicate all but one track from the studio album (&quot;Sunday Kind of Love&quot;) and five more from their 2011 offering Don't Explain, and play some other covers and a long band jam called &quot;Antwerp Jam&quot; as a finale.\n\nHart and Bonamassa are backed by a killer band to boot, including a full horn section, drummer Anton Fig, bassist Carmine Rojas, rhythm guitarist Blondie Chaplin, and keyboardist Arlan Schierbaum. Highlights include their reading of Delaney Bramlett's &quot;Well, Well,&quot; Ike Turner's &quot;Nutbush City Limits,&quot; &quot;Sinner's Prayer,&quot; &quot;Something's Got a Hold on Me,&quot; &quot;Chocolate Jesus,&quot; &quot;I Love You More Than You'll Ever Know,&quot; and, of course, Ms. Hart's devastating reading of Etta James' &quot;I'd Rather Go Blind.&quot; Given her considerable power and ability to convey a wide range of emotions, this is not merely a set for guitar god worshipers -- though there's plenty for them here, too.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCD1\n01 - Amsterdam Amsterdam\n02 - Them There Eyes\n03 - Sinner s Prayer\n04 - Can t Let Go\n05 - For My Friends\n06 - Close To My Fire\n07 - Rhymes\n08 - Something s Got A Hold On Me\n09 - Your Heart Is As Black As Night\n10 - Chocolate Jesus\n11 - Baddest Blues\n12 - Someday After Awhile You ll Be Sorry\n\nCD2\n01 - Well Well\n02 - If I Tell You I Love You\n03 - See Saw\n04 - Strange Fruit\n05 - Miss Lady\n06 - I Love You More Than You ll Ever Know\n07 - Nutbush City Limits\n08 - I d Rather Go Blind\n09 - Antwerp Jam\n\n*2014 J&amp;R Adventures | JRA51151\n\n\nPersonnel:\nBeth Hart - vocals, piano\nJoe Bonamassa - guitar, vocals\nBlondie Chaplin - rhythm guitar, backing vocals\nCarmine Rojas - bass\nAnton Fig - drums\nArlan Schierbaum - keyboards\nLee Thornburg - trumpet, percussion\nRon Dziubla - sax, percussion\nCarlos Perez Alfonso - trombone, percussion\n\n\n\nEnjoy, SEED and SHARING...
