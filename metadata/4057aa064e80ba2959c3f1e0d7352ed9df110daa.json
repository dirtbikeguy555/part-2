It is also developed by a different company.\n\nAs with the original Falcon 4.0, you fly the F-16 in either instant action, multiplayer, a tactical engagement or one of two large dynamic campaigns. In the campaign, you can control every aspect of the air war, and some aspects of the ground war. You can choose to make up every sortie yourself if you wish, or simply leave the computer to it, adding your own as you see fit.\n\nThe new features include a new campaign set in the Balkans, along with a revised version of the existing Korean campaign, general improvements to realism (flight models, etc.), a more realistic cockpit, better graphics, an improved, more realistic radar, a dynamic campaign engine and an improved graphics engine with volumetric clouds and advanced lighting effects.\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4057aa064e80ba2959c3f1e0d7352ed9df110daa","amp;dn":"Falcon+4.0+Allied+Force+%28PC+Flight+Sim%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4057aa064e80ba2959c3f1e0d7352ed9df110daa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,87,170,6,78,128,186,41,89,195,241,224,215,53,46,217,223,17,13,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
