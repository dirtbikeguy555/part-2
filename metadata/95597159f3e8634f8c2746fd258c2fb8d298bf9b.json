Cox and ForshawÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s contention? There is no need for quantum mechanics to be viewed this way. There is a lot of mileage in the Ã¢â‚¬Å“weirdnessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of the quantum world, and it often leads to confusion and, frankly, bad science. The Quantum Universe cuts through the Wu Li and asks what observations of the natural world made it necessary, how it was constructed, and why we are confident that, for all its apparent strangeness, it is a good theory.\nThe quantum mechanics of The Quantum Universe provide a concrete model of nature that is comparable in its essence to NewtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s laws of motion, MaxwellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s theory of electricity and magnetism, and EinsteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s theory of relativity.\nGenre: Non-Fiction&gt; Physics&gt; Quantum Theory","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95597159f3e8634f8c2746fd258c2fb8d298bf9b","amp;dn":"Quantum+Universe_+Everything+that+can+happen+does+happen%2C+The+-+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95597159f3e8634f8c2746fd258c2fb8d298bf9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,89,113,89,243,232,99,79,140,39,70,253,37,140,47,184,210,152,191,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
