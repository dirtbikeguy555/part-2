The album was their first with guitarist Adrian Smith and their last with vocalist Paul Di'Anno, who was sacked after problems with his stage performance arose due to his alcohol and cocaine use. This was also the first Iron Maiden album made with veteran producer Martin Birch, who went on to produce their next eight albums before retiring after Fear of the Dark in 1992.\n\nThe song &quot;Wrathchild&quot; is the only regularly played track from the album, appearing in almost all their concert tours. The song was covered in 2003 by British metal band Sikth and featured as a b-side on their single &quot;Scent of the Obscene&quot;. The song was also covered in 2005 by female tribute band The Iron Maidens on their 2007 album Route 666 and again in 2008 by Gallows on the tribute CD Maiden Heaven: A Tribute to Iron Maiden released by Kerrang! magazine. &quot;Wrathchild&quot; was featured in the PlayStation 2 game Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s.\n\n\n\n1. \t&quot;The Ides of March&quot; (instrumental) \t  \t1:46\n2. \t&quot;Wrathchild&quot;   \t  \t2:55\n3. \t&quot;Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot;   \t  \t4:19\n4. \t&quot;Another Life&quot;   \t  \t3:23\n5. \t&quot;Genghis Khan&quot; (instrumental) \t  \t3:09\n6. \t&quot;Innocent Exile&quot;   \t  \t3:54\n7. \t&quot;Killers&quot;   \tHarris, Di'Anno \t5:01\n8. \t&quot;Prodigal Son&quot;   \t  \t6:12\n9. \t&quot;Purgatory&quot;   \t  \t3:20\n10. \t&quot;Twilight Zone&quot;   \tMurray, Harris \t2:33\n11. \t&quot;Drifter&quot;  \n12. \t&quot;Twilight Zone&quot;   \tMurray, Harris \t2:33\n13. \t&quot;Women in Uniform&quot; (originally by Skyhooks) \tGreg Macainsh \t3:07\n14. \t&quot;Invasion&quot;   \t  \t2:38\n15. \t&quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; (live) \t  \t6:55\n16.     &quot;Running Free&quot; (live) \tHarris, Di'Anno 3:14\n17.     &quot;Iron Maiden&quot; (live)    Di'Anno         4:07\n                                              64:20\n\n\nIron Maiden\nformat    mp3\nbitrate   VBR Extreme","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a9e6f1bcf9ca4014dc6e13c5c9716fb70d36b97","amp;dn":"Iron+Maiden+-+Killers+%28Deluxe+Edition%29+%5B1981%5D+++ak61","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a9e6f1bcf9ca4014dc6e13c5c9716fb70d36b97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,158,111,27,207,156,164,1,77,198,225,60,92,151,22,251,112,211,107,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
