Famously described as the first heavy metal band to top the pop chart (a claim that greatly depends on one's exact definition of heavy metal), the Los Angeles quartet became an overnight sensation thanks to their monster 1983 smash album Metal Health. But Quiet Riot's road to success had in fact been long and arduous, and when their star power subsequently began to fade, their fall from grace was ironically accelerated by the man who was most responsible for taking them to the top: singer Kevin DuBrow. Unable to suppress his infamous motor mouth from assaulting many of Quiet Riot's peers, DuBrow gradually alienated his fans and fellow musicians, and in the face of plummeting record sales, faced the iniquity of being fired from his own band. The dust eventually settled and DuBrow was able to resurrect Quiet Riot in the 1990s, but despite their best efforts, the once chart-topping band would remain forever exiled to the fringes of pop conscience, and what might once have been a full chapter in rock history has instead become little more than a footnote. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nSource:\t\t\tWeb\nGenre:\t\t\tMetal\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.Cum On Feel The Noize\n02.Bang Your Head (Metal Health)\n03.Slick Black Cadillac\n04.The Wild &amp; The Young\n05.Mama We're All Crazy Now\n06.Party All Night\n07.The Joker\n08.Stay With Me Tonight\n09.Callin' The Shots\n10.Bang Your Head (Metal Health) (Live Version)\n11.Let's Go Crazy (Live)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2ff8d67ff63830fef53198d3ad324c50972dd29","amp;dn":"Quiet+Riot+-+Greatest+Hits+%281996%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2ff8d67ff63830fef53198d3ad324c50972dd29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,255,141,103,255,99,131,15,239,83,25,141,58,211,36,197,9,114,221,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
