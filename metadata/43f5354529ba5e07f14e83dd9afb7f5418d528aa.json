They're all here including &quot;You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'&quot;, &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; and &quot;You're My Soul and Inspiration&quot;. The recording may seem primitive since the songs were not re-mastered, so they sound exactly like they did back then. But I think that just adds to the atmosphere. They are old songs after all, and they're still audible and you can make out the lyrics that are being sung. The music is wonderful and does create a nice soundscape reminiscent of Phil Spector's\nwall of sound (he did produce a number of their songs). This is a great album that will satisfy most fans and casual listeners. Die-hard fans might be disappointed though and might want to look at other Righteous Brothers releases for a more in depth collection of songs. But for most of us this wonderful little collection will suffice. Also includes some of their lesser known and somewhat forgotten songs including, &quot;Ebb Tide&quot;, &quot;Just Once In My Life&quot; and &quot;Go Ahead and Cry&quot;. This is also a good album to purchase if you're just discovering the talented Righteous Brothers. It's a classic example of white soul! Listening to this album,\nthe listener almost feels like they're someplace else.\n\nWe rip the descriptions from sites like cduniverse, allmusic and amazon.\nHHI presents no opinion on the artists work; only the quality of the rip. :)\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.You've lost that lovin' feelin'                      [03:49]\n02.Unchained melody                                     [03:39]\n03.(you're my) soul and inspiration                     [03:25]\n04.Ebb tide                                             [02:51]\n05.Just once in my life                                 [03:52]\n06.The white cliffs of dover                            [02:20]\n07.He                                                   [03:04]\n08.Hung on you                                          [03:27]\n09.Little latin lupe lu                                 [02:22]\n10.Go ahead and cry                                     [02:38]\n11.See that girl                                        [03:13]\n12.On this side of goodbye                              [03:10]\n____\n\n37:50 min\n 51,3 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
