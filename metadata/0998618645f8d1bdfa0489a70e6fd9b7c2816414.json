Tracy Anderson: The Pregnancy Project\n\nWhile pregnant with her son 13 years ago, Tracy gained over 60 pounds. It was this significant weight gain, along with a weight gain that Tracy experienced while studying dance, which propelled her to research and develop the Tracy Anderson Method. After announcing her second pregnancy in 2012, Tracy Anderson began production on a series of pregnancy workout DVDs to serve as a guide for women throughout their pregnancy.\n\nSimilar to TracyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s successful Metamorphosis DVDs, this series contains many more tools than just the workouts. The series contains nine different workouts, one workout focused on each month of pregnancy, which Tracy filmed in real time. In addition to the workouts, the series contains interviews with doctors, mothers, TracyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clients, and various experts on pregnancy. The advice from these experts also include testimonials from TracyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clients that have been able to attribute their post-pregnancy bodies to TracyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s method.\n\nThe Pregnancy Project is designed to be a guide for expectant parents and covers everything from nutrition, to fitness, to the leading studies on pregnancy. Tracy already has a tremendously successful post-pregnancy workout DVD, with over 1 million copies sold, and this project is designed to be a much more comprehensive tool for women at all stages of pregnancy and motherhood.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0998618645f8d1bdfa0489a70e6fd9b7c2816414","amp;dn":"Tracy+Anderson+Workouts+-+x264+-+MP4+-+DVDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0998618645f8d1bdfa0489a70e6fd9b7c2816414","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,152,97,134,69,248,209,189,250,4,137,167,14,111,217,183,194,129,100,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
