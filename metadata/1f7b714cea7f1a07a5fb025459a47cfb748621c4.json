Install Macrium Reflect x86 for 32 bit operating system and x64 for 64 bit operating system\r\n2. Copy the path file (x86 for 32bit version and x64 for 64bit version) to the installed folder\r\n3. Patch and it's done\r\nNOTE: Please block the application from connecting to the internet using a firewall, preventing issues with the crack.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The best way to update while the software remains properly cracked is, of course, by installing the newer version on top on the already existing one (patch must still be applied).\r\nIf by any chance you have removed the previous version, and you get a message saying that the license has expired with the new installer, there are several ways which may able you to install the newer version without this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. By cleaning the registry, navigate through HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -&gt; SOFTWARE -&gt; Microsoft -&gt; there will be a key with the name &quot;Environment&quot; this key appears to be empty, but it's not, the contents of this key are hidden, delete the &quot;Environment&quot; key, reboot your PC and try installing Macrium Reflect.\r\n\r\n1.1 You can also go with a tool named Registry Trash Keys Finder which can be found at thepiratebay.se/torrent/10359095 after installed and properly patch, run it, go to Files -&gt; Search Null-embbeded Keys... -&gt; click OK on the &quot;Registry Roots for Search&quot; dialogue, after the search is done, find a key named &quot;Environment|0|&quot; delete it, reboot PC, and try installing Macrium Reflect. Thanks to shmu26 for pointing out this method.\r\n\r\n2. Another method that works almost flawlessly is by installing the first version which you had installed and patched, and then updating to the new version. Make sure the old version is patched before you update to the newer version, and also patch the newer version\r\n\r\nOfficial Website: http://www.macrium.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f7b714cea7f1a07a5fb025459a47cfb748621c4","amp;dn":"Macrium+Reflect+Workstation+-+Server+-+Server+Plus+v6.2.1502","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f7b714cea7f1a07a5fb025459a47cfb748621c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,123,113,76,234,127,26,7,165,251,2,84,89,164,124,251,116,134,33,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
