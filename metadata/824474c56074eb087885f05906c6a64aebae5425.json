She also had a dream that one day she would be a comedian on TV.\n\nShe has seen both these dreams come true.\n\nAt last, Tina Fey's story can be told. From her youthful days as a vicious nerd to her tour of duty on Saturday Night Live; from her passionately halfhearted pursuit of physical beauty to her life as a mother eating things off the floor; from her one-sided college romance to her nearly fatal honeymoon -- from the beginning of this paragraph to this final sentence.\n\nTina Fey reveals all, and proves what we've all suspected: you're no one until someone calls you bossy.\n\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:824474c56074eb087885f05906c6a64aebae5425","amp;dn":"Tina+Fey+-+Bossypants%2CEpub%2C+Mobi%2C+KK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"824474c56074eb087885f05906c6a64aebae5425","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,68,116,197,96,116,235,8,120,133,240,89,6,198,166,74,235,174,84,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
