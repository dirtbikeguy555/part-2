Had it not been for the amazing Bruce Lee and his incredible movies in the early 1970s, it's arguable whether or not the martial arts film genre would have ever penetrated and influenced mainstream western cinema &amp; audiences the way it has over the past four decades.\n\nThe influence of Asian martial arts cinema can be seen today in so many other film genres including comedies, action, drama, science fiction, horror and animation.....and they all have their roots in the phenomenon that was Bruce Lee.\n\nLee was born &quot;Lee Jun Fan&quot; 27 November 1940 in San Francisco, the son of Lee Hoi Chuen, a singer with the Cantonese Opera. Approximately, one year later the family returned to Kowloon in Hong Kong and at the age of 5, a young Bruce begins appearing in children's roles in minor films including The Birth of Mankind (1946) and Fu gui fu yun (1948). At the age of 12, Bruce commenced attending La Salle College, and was later beaten up by a street gang, which inspired him to take up martial arts training under the tutelage of &quot;Sifu Yip Man&quot; who schooled Bruce in wing chun kung fu for a period of approximately five years. This was the only formalized martial arts training ever undertaken by Lee. The talented &amp; athletic Bruce also took up cha-cha dancing, and at the age of 18 won a major dance championship in Hong Kong.\n\nHowever, his temper and quick fists got him in trouble the HK police on numerous occasions, and his parents suggested that he head off to the United States. Lee landed in San Francisco's Chinatown in 1959 and worked in a relative's restaurant, however he eventually made his way to Seattle, Washington where he enrolled at university to study philosophy, and found the time to practice his beloved kung fu techniques. In 1963, Lee met Linda Emery (later his wife) and also opened his first kung fu school at 4750 University Way. During the early half of the 1960s, Lee became associated with many key martial arts figures in the USA including kenpo karate expert Ed Parker and tae kwon do master Jhoon Rhee. He made guest appearances at notable martial arts events including the Long Beach Nationals. Through one of these tournaments, Bruce met Hollywood hair stylist Jay Sebring who introduced him to TV producer William Dozier. Based on the runaway success of &quot;Batman&quot;, Dozier was keen to bring the cartoon character of &quot;The Green Hornet&quot; to TV and was on the lookout for an Oriental actor to play the Green Hornet's sidekick, &quot;Kato&quot;. Around this time, Bruce also opened a second kung fu school in Oakland, California and relocated to Oakland to be closer to Hollywood.\n\n\n\n\n                        ENJOY...................................................\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        PLEASE..SEED..!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2282b00b0fa0c81dee83fb134203e94e4a317c21","amp;dn":"Bruce+Lee+Ultimate+Collection+%5B5+Discs%5D+Plus+Enter+the+dragon%2C+d","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2282b00b0fa0c81dee83fb134203e94e4a317c21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,130,176,11,15,160,200,29,238,131,251,19,66,3,233,78,74,49,124,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
