From East Timor to Waco, he has exposed some of the most egregious cases of political corruption, corporate fraud, and financial manipulation in the US and abroad. His uncanny investigative skills as well as his no-holds-barred style have made him an anathema among magnates on four continents and a living legend among his colleagues and his devoted readership.\r\n\r\nThis exciting collection, now revised and updated, brings together some of Palast's most powerful writing of the past decade. Included here are his celebrated Washington Post exposÃ© on Jeb Bush and Katherine Harris's stealing of the presidential election in Florida, and recent stories on George W. Bush's payoffs to corporate cronies, the payola behind Hillary Clinton, and the faux energy crisis. Also included in this volume are new and previously unpublished material, television transcripts, photographs, and letters","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:513f581c01cb8af6f7016e7ca8c9f396904d5f0e","amp;dn":"Greg+Palast+-+The+Best+Democracy+Money+Can+Buy+-+pdf+%5BTKRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"513f581c01cb8af6f7016e7ca8c9f396904d5f0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,63,88,28,1,203,138,246,247,1,110,124,168,201,243,150,144,77,95,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
