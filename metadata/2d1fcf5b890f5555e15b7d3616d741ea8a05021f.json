It contains about 2000 problem covering the major areas of Physical science: mechanics, thermodynamics, molecular physics, electrodynamics, oscillations and waves, optics, atomic and nuclear physics. Each section is preceded by a short summary of appropriate formulas whose total number exceeds 300. The answers to all of the problems are given at the end of volume. Most difficult problems are provided with explanations. Moreover, the author presents some general hints helping the undergraduate to tackle physical problems. Problems in General Physics is an excellent book which may serve as a valuable supplement to any college course on the subject","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d1fcf5b890f5555e15b7d3616d741ea8a05021f","amp;dn":"Problems+in+General+Physics+-+I.E.+Irodov","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d1fcf5b890f5555e15b7d3616d741ea8a05021f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,31,207,91,137,15,85,85,225,91,125,54,22,215,65,234,138,5,2,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
