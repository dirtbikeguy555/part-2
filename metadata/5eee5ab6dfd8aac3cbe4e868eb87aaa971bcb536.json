It was released on 8 May 1970 by the band's Apple Records label shortly after the group announced their break-up.\n\nMost of Let It Be was recorded in January 1969, before the recording and release of the album Abbey Road. For this reason, some critics and fans, such as Mark Lewisohn, argue that Abbey Road should be considered the group's final album and Let It Be the penultimate. Let It Be was originally intended to be released before Abbey Road during mid-1969 as Get Back, but The Beatles were unhappy with this version, which was mixed and compiled by Glyn Johns, and it was temporarily shelved. A new version of the album was created by Phil Spector in 1970 and finally released as Let It Be, serving as the album for the 1970 motion picture of the same name. While three songs from the sessions were released as singles before the album's release, &quot;Get Back&quot;/&quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; and &quot;Let It Be&quot;, the songs were remixed by Spector for the album and &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; was not included.\n\n2009 Remaster - Track Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;Two of Us&quot;   \t\n02. \t&quot;Dig a Pony&quot;   \t\n03. \t&quot;Across the Universe&quot;   \t\n04. \t&quot;I Me Mine&quot;\n05. \t&quot;Dig It&quot; \n06. \t&quot;Let It Be&quot;   \n07. \t&quot;Maggie Mae&quot;  \n08. \t&quot;I've Got a Feeling&quot;  \n09. \t&quot;One After 909&quot;   \t\n10. \t&quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;   \n11. \t&quot;For You Blue&quot; \n12. \t&quot;Get Back&quot;   \t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5eee5ab6dfd8aac3cbe4e868eb87aaa971bcb536","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+Let+It+Be+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5eee5ab6dfd8aac3cbe4e868eb87aaa971bcb536","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,238,90,182,223,216,170,195,203,228,232,104,235,135,170,169,113,188,181,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
