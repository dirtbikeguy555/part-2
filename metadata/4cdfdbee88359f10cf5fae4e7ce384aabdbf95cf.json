A still beautiful, but weary and disillusioned (and, as we later discover, ailing) Lola Montes (Martine Carol) is first seen as the featured attraction at a seedy American circus, appearing at the center of a series of various tableaux depicting the scandalous events for which she is known. With a strangely sincere yet sinister and manipulative ringmaster (Peter Ustinov) providing color commentary, some of it very ironic on two or more levels, the movie flows between these staged recreations in the circus and the events as recalled by the subject. In a series of dissolves, the film takes us through her girlhood with her mother, interrupted when her mother's lover (Ivan Desni) becomes attached to the daughter; her unhappy marriage and its aftermath; romances with composer Franz Liszt (Will Quadflieg), abduction by a Russian general (in the arms of Cossacks, no less); her affairs across the landscape of Europe with men great and notable; her thwarted aspirations as a dancer; and her romance with King Ludwig I (Anton Walbrook) of Bavaria, which led to her being made Countess of Landsfeld, and, later, to his abdication. The gracefulness of Ophuls' cyclical narrative, and the transitions between the recalled elegance of the locales, and the people with whom her romances and affairs took place, and the seediness of the circus -- where she is also compelled, in the course of performing, to perform as an aerialist -- were lost on viewers in 1955. And for many years the movie only existed in a version re-cut without the director's approval, in which the story was presented in linear fashion. It was only in the 1960's, long after Ophuls' death, that efforts were made to restore the original structure, and in 2008 the movie's original Technicolor luster was restored to its full depth and richness. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Lola Montes.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.90 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 55mn\n      Overall bit rate : 2 359 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Custom\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 55mn\n      Bit rate : 1 705 Kbps\n      Width : 688 pixels\n      Height : 272 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 2.529\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.380\n      Stream size : 1.38 GiB (72%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.3.0.dev55\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 55mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 448 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 3 channels\n      Channel positions : L C R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 370 MiB (19%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n   Audio #2\n      ID : 2\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 55mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 159 MiB (8%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n\nFrench, German and English audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048308/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048308/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPosted originally at KG by crasus, whom we thank\n\nMax Ophuls - Lola Montes (1955)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cdfdbee88359f10cf5fae4e7ce384aabdbf95cf","amp;dn":"Max+Ophuls+-+Lola+Montes+%281955%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cdfdbee88359f10cf5fae4e7ce384aabdbf95cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,223,219,238,136,53,159,16,207,95,174,78,124,227,132,170,189,191,149,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
