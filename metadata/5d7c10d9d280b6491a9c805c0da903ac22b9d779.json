She feels (mostly) relaxed about the future in which her husband and career will be decided, and looks forward to turning 18, when sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be cured of deliria, a.k.a. love. She tries not to think about her motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s suicide (her last words to Lena were a forbidden Ã¢â‚¬Å“I love youÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) or the supposed Ã¢â‚¬Å“InvalidÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ community made up of the uncured just beyond her Portland, Maine, border. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no real pointÃ¢â‚¬â€she believes her government knows how to best protect its people, and should do so at any cost. But 95 days before her cure, Lena meets Alex, a confident and mysterious young man who makes her heart flutter and her skin turn red-hot. As their romance blossoms, Lena begins to doubt the intentions of those in power, and fears that her world will turn gray should she submit to the procedure. In this powerful and beautifully written novel, Lauren Oliver, the bestselling author of Before I Fall, throws readers into a tightly controlled society where options donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t exist, and shows not only the lengths one will go for a chance at freedom, but also the true meaning of sacrifice. --Jessica Schein\n- Goodreads Summaries of Delirium (Delirium #1)\n\nNote: A critically acclaimed series mainly for a young adult audience, but is recommendable to all fans of dystopian societies. Includes the original three books (Delirium, Pandemonium &amp; Requiem) plus the three short stories in between giving some more depth and backstory to the characters (Annabel, Hana &amp; Raven). A very interesting trilogy and should be on everybody's &quot;to-read&quot; list. Happy reading!\n\n[A More Personal] Note: This is my hundredth upload!
