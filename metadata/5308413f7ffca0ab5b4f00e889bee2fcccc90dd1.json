This course makes use of Blender but the majority of the material is applicable to any software that supports subdivision surface modeling. This course covers all the fundamentals that are vital to modeling, including topology, subdivision surfaces, organic modeling, hard-surface modeling, sculpting, low polygon modeling, and more\n\nCourse Objective\nThe goal of this course is to guide the students towards mastering mesh modeling by gaining a deeper understanding of surface, form, topology, modeling tools, and the modeling process. Ideally, the student will walk away from the workshop with the understanding of how to approach modeling anything, regardless of the subject matter, by focusing on the topology, workÃ¯Â¬â€šow, and forms of the subject; not the subject its self.At the end of the course each student has the opportunity to submit a Ã¯Â¬ï¿½nal exercise model which will be reviewed by the instructor. If the model passes inspection the student will receive a certiÃ¯Â¬ï¿½cate signed by CG Cookie stating they have completed the course. Basic members will receive a PDF version of the certiÃ¯Â¬ï¿½cate, while Premiere students will receive a printed and laminated certiÃ¯Â¬ï¿½cate in the mail, along with the PDF.All students will also receive a badge on their CG Cookie proÃ¯Â¬ï¿½le indicating they have participated in a CGC workshop.Course \n\nTopics\n1.
