Step aside, Lara Croft. Video gaming has a new adventurer in Uncharted: Drake's Fortune. Trapped on a tropical island crawling with pirates, treasure hunter Nathan Drake seeks out the legendary fortune of his apparent ancestor, Sir Francis Drake. He'll explore ancient forts, lush jungles, mysterious catacombs, and other exotic areas, using a combination of firearms and hand-to-hand combat to defeat enemies. A female filmmaker named Elena Fisher accompanies Drake to document his latest exploits. \n\nAs with more famous video game heroes, Drake is no slouch when it comes to feats of agility, from swinging on vines to leaping over rocks to shimmying across precarious ledges. He must also seek out and use cover to protect himself from enemy gunfire. Dramatic chase sequences on watercraft and in a jeep are included for a cinematic feel, and over 50 minutes of cut-scenes help flesh out the swashbuckling story. Drake's Fortune is developer Naughty Dog's (Crash Bandicoot, Jak and Daxter) first foray on PlayStation 3. \n\nFeatures: \n~~~~~~~ \n\n    Use the motion-sensing Sixaxis controller to throw grenades, balance while walking across logs, and more \n    Master the game's cover mechanic to protect yourself from incoming gunfire \n    Collect bonus-unlocking medals by finding secrets and performing specific achievements \n\nCONTROLS: \n~~~~~~~~ \n\nMENU CONTROLS \n\nD-Pad Up or Down navigate menu, highlight menu item \nD-Pad Left or Right adjust menu item \nX Button select highlighted menu item \nCircle Button previous screen, return to main menu \n\nGAME CONTROLS \n\nTriangle or Start Button pause during cinematic \nLeft Analog Stick walk, run, swim \nRight Analog Stick camera rotate, pan \nL3 Button adjust aiming camera between left and right shoulder \nL2 Button (Hold) + Right Analog Stick look mode \nTriangle Button interact, pick up \nR3 Button reset camera \nD-Pad, Down, Left or Right weapon select \nR2 or D-Pad Up reload \nCircle Button take cover behind object \nR1 Button fire weapon \nR1 Button blind fire (when taking cover) \nL1 Button (Hold) + R1 Button lean out and fire (when taking cover) \nL1 Button (Hold) + Right Analog Stick manual aim \nSquare Button enter melee combat (when facing an enemy) \nSquare Button (X5) fast, furios combo \nSquare Button + Triangle Button + Square Button brutal combo (with timing) \nR1 Button + Square Button steel fist combo \nSquare Button stealth kill (sneak up on enemy undetected) \nR1 Button + Left Analog Stick run and gun \nCircle Button roll (while moving in any direction or between areas of cover) \nX Button jump, climb \nCircle Button drop down, grab ledge (when standing above a ledge) \nL1 Button (Hold) + Sixaxis Wireless Controller aim grenade \nL1 Button (Hold) + R1 Button + Sixaxis Wirelss Controller throw grenade \nSelect Button access diary, map (when diary/map icon appears) \nStart Button pause menu \n\nTRAVERSAL \n\nJET SKI \n\nLeft Analog Stick steer \nRight Analog Stick camera rotate, pan \nX or R2 Button accelerate \nCircle or Square Button brake, reverse \nL1 Button (Hold) + Right Analog Stick aim weapon \nR1 Button fire weapon \n\nInstall Notes: \n~~~~~~~~~ \n\nConfirmed working on an external USB drive (FAT32) with PS3 on CFW 3.55 KMEAW using multiMAN v1.16.01 \n\nJust press [X] to start the game. \n\nBTW an original PS3 game is still needed in the Blu-ray player. \n\nAnd finally enjoy it !!! \n\n:P ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55894bdd3853d1e672403fba1d741fe0122ab923","amp;dn":"Uncharted.Drakes.Fortune.PS3-DUPLEX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55894bdd3853d1e672403fba1d741fe0122ab923","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,137,75,221,56,83,209,230,114,64,63,186,29,116,31,224,18,42,185,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
