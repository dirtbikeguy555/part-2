The documentary, which contains startling footage from Dachau, Buchenwald and Bergen-Belsen, was left unfinished and stored in a vault of London's Imperial War Museum. In 1985, this somber record of man's capacity for inhumanity was broadcast for the first time by &quot;Frontline&quot; with narration by actor Trevor Howard.\n\nLOADER'S NOTE - This documentary consists almost entirely of raw footage taken by soldiers. It is extremely stark and open, and may be difficult for some people to sit through.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90cd525f5113d2c96308330f0b46f4667c030368","amp;dn":"Frontline+-+Memory+of+the+Camps+%28PBS+Holocaust+Documentary%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90cd525f5113d2c96308330f0b46f4667c030368","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,205,82,95,81,19,210,201,99,8,51,15,11,70,244,102,124,3,3,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
