Thirty years after its initial public airing, Le Samourai (1967) finally saw a limited American release in its intended form. Alain Delon stars as Jef Costello, a professional Parisian assassin-for-hire who, by nature of his work&amp;#039;s solitary demands, has no friends. Although he is loved by Jane Lagrange (Natalie Delon, the star&amp;#039;s real-life wife), Costello knows that Jane already has a lover. After he successfully wipes out a nightclub owner at the behest of his boss, Costello discovers that he was seen by the club&amp;#039;s pianist, Valerie (Cathy Rosier). Although he survives a police lineup thanks to a lie offered up by the fearless Valerie, Costello&amp;#039;s alibi disintegrates rapidly and his shadowy employer takes out a contract on him. As he seeks revenge on his betrayer, Costello must also stay one step ahead of a wily, determined superintendent (Francois Perier). Melville&amp;#039;s film influenced several other filmmakers and projects, most notably director John Woo&amp;#039;s The Killer (1989).\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062229/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062229/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSUBS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-21073&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-21073&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDirector:\nJean-Pierre Melville\n\n\tAlain Delon\t ... \tJef Costello\n\tFranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ois PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rier\t... \tThe Superintendant\n\tNathalie Delon\t... \tJane Lagrange\n\tCathy Rosier\t... \tValÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rie, la pianiste (as Caty Rosier)\n\tJacques Leroy\t... \tGunman\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [Matroska]\nDuration : 00:33:44\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 720x400\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 0 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,00 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : (Dolby(TM)) AC3\nNumber of channels : 1\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 0 Kbps\n\n\nENJOY  AND  SEED\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07dad6f5697d772b9d29a7de019120d69ab7613e","amp;dn":"Le+Samourai+%281967%29++Alain+Delon%2C+Francois+Perier%2C+Nathalie+Delon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07dad6f5697d772b9d29a7de019120d69ab7613e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,218,214,245,105,125,119,43,157,41,167,222,1,145,32,214,154,183,97,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
