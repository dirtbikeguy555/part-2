Doesn't everyone already know what the songs sound like? Sure, you could go on about which songs the band chose. You could even give your opinion on which songs &quot;should have&quot; been on the album. That is not the case with this album. Dave Mustaine did something I don't think I've ever seen before. He let the fans decide what songs were on the album.\nSince the fans know best what they want on an album criticizing the song selections would be like explaining how we all voted for the wrong singer in American Idol. It would be like biting the media hand that feeds you. What I can do is give you a run down on the album art, copy quality and pretty much anything else that pops into my head.\n\n1.
