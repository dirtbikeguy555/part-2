Costi (Cuzin Toma) is a workaday family man whose cash-strapped next-door neighbor (Adrian Purcarescu) makes him an intriguing proposition: help him find the fortune reportedly buried somewhere on the grounds of his family's country home and split the profits. But as the two men dig, they unearth more than they bargained for, excavating not only dirt, but traces of Romania's often tumultuous history. Part modern day fable, part profound social commentary,The Treasure confirms Porumboiu's status as &quot;one of our great contemporary observers of the human comedy&quot;.\r\n\r\n\r\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English / Spanish","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1b0eb978b258585e20879824f52e8573a4f3386","amp;dn":"Comoara+aka+The+Treasure+2015+WEB-DL+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1b0eb978b258585e20879824f52e8573a4f3386","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,176,235,151,139,37,133,133,226,8,121,130,79,82,232,87,58,79,51,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
