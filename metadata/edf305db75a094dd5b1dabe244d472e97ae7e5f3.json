Still in his 20&amp;#039;s, Andy has developed a mastery of the 6-string guitar and the harp guitar that leaves me speechless. I find myself listening to his tunes over and over again, discovering new nuances every time. He is the most textural player of the instrument since Michael Hedges, and he creates sonic architecture worthy of the great modern composers for any instrument. - Don Ross\n\nProduct Details\n\n   * Audio CD (January 10, 2006)\n   * Original Release Date: November 15, 2005\n   * Number of Discs: 1\n   * Label: CandyRat Records\n   * ASIN: B000E5N0C6\n\nTrack Listings\n1.
