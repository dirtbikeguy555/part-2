Sledge sang all of his songs that way, delivering them in a powerful rush where he quickly changed from soulful belting to quavering, tearful pleas. It was a voice that made him one of the key figures of deep Southern soul during the late '60s. Sledge recorded at Muscle Shoals studios in Alabama, where he frequently sang songs written by Spooner Oldham and Dan Penn. Not only did he sing deep soul, but Sledge was among the pioneers of country-soul, singing songs by Charlie Rich and Kris Kristofferson in a gritty, passionate style. During the '70s, his commercial success quickly faded away, but Sledge continued to tour and record into the '90s.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tSoul and R&amp;B\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.When A Man Loves A Woman\n02.Warm And Tender Love\n03.It Tears Me Up\n04.Try A Little Tenderness\n05.The Dark End Of The Street\n06.Take Time To Know Her\n07.True Love Travels On A Gravel Road\n08.Stop The World Tonight\n09.It's All Wrong But It's Alright\n10.Out Of Left Field\n11.Cover Me\n12.Put A Little Lovin' On Me\n13.Love Me Like You Mean It\n14.I'm Hanging Up My Heart For You\n15.Bless Your Sweet Little Soul\n16.Sudden Stop\n17.Drown In My Own Tears\n18.Kind Woman\n19.Push Mr. Pride Aside\n20.It Can't Be Stopped\n21.Love Me Tender\n22.Rainbow Road\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76460eb7334a8753f85daad3925af013d0d8ebcb","amp;dn":"Percy+Sledge+-+The+Platinum+Collection+%282007%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76460eb7334a8753f85daad3925af013d0d8ebcb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,70,14,183,51,74,135,83,248,93,170,211,146,90,240,19,208,216,235,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
