We have not made much progress in learning how to cooperate with one another more effectively or how to conduct our conflicts more peacefully. Instead, we have increased the lethality of our combat through revolutions in weapons technology and military training. The Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace, and Conflict is designed to help us to take stock of our knowledge concerning these crucial phenomena.&quot;\r\n\r\nTen years on, the need for an authoritative and cross-disciplinary approach to the great issues of violence and peace seems greater than ever.\r\n\r\nMore than 200 authoritative multidisciplinary articles in a 3-volume set\r\nMany brand-new articles alongside revised and updated content from the First Edition\r\nArticle outline and glossary of key terms at the beginning of each article\r\nEntries arranged alphabetically for easy access\r\nArticles written by more than 200 eminent contributors from around the world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c03176deae1fef3da5557cee37cfd7a1b47c3781","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Violence%2C+Peace%2C+%26amp%3B+Conflict+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c03176deae1fef3da5557cee37cfd7a1b47c3781","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,49,118,222,174,31,239,61,165,85,124,238,55,207,215,161,180,124,55,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
