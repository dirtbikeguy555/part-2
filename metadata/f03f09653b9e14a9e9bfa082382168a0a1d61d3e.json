Susan Wise Bauer provides both sweeping scope and vivid attention to the individual lives that give flesh to abstract assertions about human history. This narrative history employs the methods of &quot;history from beneath&quot; - literature, epic traditions, private letters, and accounts - to connect kings and leaders with the lives of those they ruled. The result is an engrossing tapestry of human behavior from which we may draw conclusions about the direction of world events and the causes behind them.\r\nDownload the accompanying reference guide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f03f09653b9e14a9e9bfa082382168a0a1d61d3e","amp;dn":"The+History+of+the+Ancient+World","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f03f09653b9e14a9e9bfa082382168a0a1d61d3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,63,9,101,59,158,20,169,233,191,160,130,56,33,104,160,161,214,29,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
