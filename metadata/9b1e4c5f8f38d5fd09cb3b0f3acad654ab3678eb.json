Along with punk, their music incorporated elements of reggae, dub, funk, and rockabilly. For most of their recording career the Clash consisted of Joe Strummer (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Mick Jones (lead guitar, vocals), Paul Simonon (bass guitar, vocals) and Nicky &quot;Topper&quot; Headon (drums, percussion). Headon left the group in 1982, and internal friction led to Jones' departure the following year. The group continued with new members, but finally disbanded in early 1986.\n\nThe Clash achieved commercial success in the United Kingdom with the release of their debut album, The Clash, in 1977. Their third album, London Calling, released in the UK in December 1979, earned them popularity in the United States when it came out there the following month. It was declared the best album of the 1980s a decade later by Rolling Stone magazine. In 1982 they reached new heights of success with the release of Combat Rock, which spawned the US top 10 hit &quot;Rock the Casbah&quot;, helping the album to achieve a 2x Platinum certification there. Their final album, Cut the Crap, was released in 1985","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b1e4c5f8f38d5fd09cb3b0f3acad654ab3678eb","amp;dn":"The+Clash+-+Combat+Rock+%5Bpunk%5D+1982+%28MP3-320kbps%29+-+%5B%3DFaith%3D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b1e4c5f8f38d5fd09cb3b0f3acad654ab3678eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,30,76,95,143,56,213,253,9,203,59,15,58,202,214,84,171,54,120,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
