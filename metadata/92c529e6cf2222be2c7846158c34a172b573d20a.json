ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time we show you the new gold standard in Lightroom image processing, the SLR Lounge Lightroom Preset System v5.1. We have taken something great, and made it even better.\n\nWhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s New in the Lightroom Presets v5.1?\nWe have added 95 new presets in the Lightroom Preset System v5.1 to reach 311 total presets including 278 Develop Presets, 30 Brush Presets and our 3 most Common Image Export Presets. Along with nearly 100 new presets, we have revamped all of the existing presets to improve image tonality and quality.\n\nIntuitive Naming for Lightroom Presets\nGone are the days of presets with Ã¢â‚¬Å“coolÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ but unhelpful names where you have to memorize the effect to know what the preset does. The Lightroom Preset System uses simple yet descriptive names, in a logical organization and and processing format that makes it a snap to learn and a breeze to process images.\nThis means that effects that would take minutes to apply manually to your images can now be accomplished in just a matter of seconds. In addition, with the Lightroom Preset SystemÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s library of Curves, Adjustment, Colors and Special FX, users can quickly apply and test several different looks to an image in just a quick moment.\n\nPresets for All Types of Photographers\nWhether you are a photojournalist, landscape photographer, portrait photographer, wedding photographer, or anything in-between, the Lightroom Preset Systems approach to RAW developing not only speeds up a workflow, it also puts an unlimited variety of creative options at your fingertips.\n\nContinual Education and Community Support around Presets\nStay tuned on SLR Lounge because we will be uploading tons of great tutorials using the Preset System and we will also have a section for user submitted Mixology Recipes as well!\n\nContent Breakdown:\n 1 Click Base Presets 69\n Tone Curve Presets 80\n Adjustment Presets 80\n Color FX Presets 24\n Film &amp; Lens FX Presets 8\n Legacy Mixology 17\n Brush Presets 30\n Export Presets 3\n Total Number Presets 311\n Number of New Presets 95","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92c529e6cf2222be2c7846158c34a172b573d20a","amp;dn":"SLRLounge+-+Lightroom+Preset+System+v5.1+-+MAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92c529e6cf2222be2c7846158c34a172b573d20a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,197,41,230,207,34,34,190,44,120,70,21,140,52,161,114,181,115,210,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
