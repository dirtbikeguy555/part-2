PowerShell provides full access to COM and WMI, enabling administrators to perform administrative tasks on both local and remote Windows systems.\n\nIn PowerShell, administrative tasks are generally performed by cmdlets (pronounced command-lets), which are specialized .NET classes implementing a particular operation. Sets of cmdlets may be combined together in scripts, executables (which are standalone applications), or by instantiating regular .NET classes (or WMI/COM Objects). These work by accessing data in different data stores, like the filesystem or registry, which are made available to the PowerShell runtime via Windows PowerShell providers.\n\nWindows PowerShell also provides a hosting API with which the Windows PowerShell runtime can be embedded inside other applications. These applications can then use Windows PowerShell functionality to implement certain operations, including those exposed via the graphical interface. This capability has been used by Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 to expose its management functionality as PowerShell cmdlets and providers and implement the graphical management tools as PowerShell hosts which invoke the necessary cmdlets. Other Microsoft applications including Microsoft SQL Server 2008 also expose their management interface via PowerShell cmdlets. With PowerShell, graphical interface-based management applications on Windows are layered on top of Windows PowerShell.\n\n\nA PDF collection of 39 eBooks about PowerShell. eBooks are sorted on publisher's name.\n\nAddison-Wesley Essential PowerShell (2008).pdf\nApress Pro Windows PowerShell (2008).pdf\nCourse Technology Microsoft Windows PowerShell 2.0 Programming for the Absolute Beginner 2nd (2009).pdf\nCourse Technology Microsoft Windows PowerShell Programming for the Absolute Beginner (2007).pdf\nMCGraw-Hill Osborne PowerShell for Microsoft SharePoint 2010 Administrators (2011).pdf\nManning Learn Windows PowerShell in a Month of Lunches (2011).pdf\nManning PowerShell and WMI (2012).pdf\nManning PowerShell in Depth, An Administrator's Guide (2013).pdf\nManning PowerShell in Practice (2010).pdf\nManning Windows PowerShell In Action (2007).pdf\nManning Windows Powershell in Action 2nd (2011).pdf\nMicrosoft Press Windows PowerShell 2.0, Administrator's Pocket Consultant (2009).pdf\nMicrosoft Press Windows PowerShell 3.0, Step by Step (2013).pdf\nMicrosoft Press Windows PowerShell Scripting Guide (2008).pdf\nOReilly Windows PowerShell Cookbook (2008).pdf\nOReilly Windows PowerShell Cookbook 2nd (2010).pdf\nOReilly Windows PowerShell Cookbook 3rd (2013).pdf\nOReilly Windows PowerShell Pocket Reference (2008).pdf\nOReilly Windows PowerShell Pocket Reference 2nd (2013).pdf\nOReilly Windows PowerShell for Developers (2012).pdf\nPackt Publishing Instant Oracle Database and PowerShell How-to (2013).pdf\nPackt Publishing Microsoft Exchange 2010 PowerShell Cookbook (2011).pdf\nPackt Publishing Microsoft SharePoint 2010 and Windows PowerShell 2.0, Expert Cookbook (2011).pdf\nPackt Publishing Microsoft Windows PowerShell 3.0 First Look (2012).pdf\nPackt Publishing SQL Server 2012 with PowerShell V3 Cookbook (2012).pdf\nPackt Publishing Windows Server 2012 Automation with PowerShell Cookbook (2013).pdf\nSAMS PowerShell for SharePoint 2010, How-to (2011).pdf\nSAMS Windows PowerShell Unleashed (2007).pdf\nSapien Press Windows PowerShell v1.0, TFM 2nd (2007).pdf\nSybex Automating Active Directory Administration with Windows PowerShell 2.0 (2011).pdf\nSybex Automating Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 with Windows PowerShell 2.0 (2011).pdf\nWiley Microsoft PowerShell, VBScript and JScript Bible (2009).pdf\nWiley Windows PowerShell 2 for Dummies (2009).pdf\nWiley Windows PowerShell 2.0 Bible (2011).pdf\nWrox Press Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Administration with Windows PowerShell (2009).pdf\nWrox Press Professional SQL Server 2008 Administration with Windows PowerShell (2009).pdf\nWrox Press Professional Windows PowerShell (2007).pdf\nWrox Press Professional Windows PowerShell Programming (2008).pdf\nWrox Press Professional Windows PowerShell for Exchange Server 2007 Service Pack 1 (2008).pdf\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9db7f6d02e72528f264a087500d1d789d5a58aa","amp;dn":"PowerShell+eBooks+Collection+%5BPDF%5D-OMNiSCiENT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9db7f6d02e72528f264a087500d1d789d5a58aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,219,127,109,2,231,37,40,242,100,160,135,80,13,29,120,157,90,88,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
