A conventional romantic triangle between mother, daughter, and Michele (Jean-Paul Belmondo), is barely under way when the war rears its ugly head once more. Seeking shelter in a bombed-out church, Cesira and Rosetta are attacked and raped -- a horrifying sequence, capped by a freeze-frame close-up of Rosetta, her face a taut mask of terror (this image was enough to prompt a virulent &quot;anti-smut&quot; editorial in The Saturday Evening Post). Once they've recovered from this appalling experience, mother and daughter are offered a ride back to Rome by friendly truck driver Florindo (Renato Salvatori). Though Cesira had hoped to keep her daughter from compromising herself as a means of survival, she is crushed to discover that Rosetta has given herself to the truck driver in exchange for a pair of stockings. When Cesira and Rosetta finally reconcile, it is a grievous occasion, mourning the death of their mutual love, Michele. A last-minute replacement for Anna Magnani, Sophia Loren brought hitherto untapped depths of emotion to her performance in Two Women; she later stated that she was utilizing &quot;sensory recall,&quot; dredging up memories of her own wartime experiences. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : La Ciociara.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 37mn\n      Overall bit rate : 2 010 Kbps\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : Simple@L3\n      Format settings, BVOP : No\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 37mn\n      Bit rate : 1 869 Kbps\n      Width : 720 pixels\n      Height : 400 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 16:9\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.260\n      Stream size : 1.27 GiB (93%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 37mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 128 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 89.1 MiB (6%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\n      Writing library : LAME3.98\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054749/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054749/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nItalian and German audio; English, Spanush and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted originally at KG by newland, whom we thank\n\nVittorio De Sica - La Ciociara (1960)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46724cb5fadbb88f5fce0596f12886bb70bd46da","amp;dn":"Vittorio+De+Sica+-+La+Ciociara+%281960%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46724cb5fadbb88f5fce0596f12886bb70bd46da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,114,76,181,250,219,184,143,95,206,5,150,241,40,134,187,112,189,70,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
