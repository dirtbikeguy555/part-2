It is about the power of reading, the price of betrayal, and the possibility of redemption. And it is also about the power of fathers over sons -- their love, their sacrifices, their lies.\nThe first Afghan novel to be written in English, The Kite Runner tells a sweeping story of family, love, and friendship against a backdrop of history that has not been told in fiction before, bringing to mind the large canvasses of the Russian writers of the nineteenth century. But just as it is old-fashioned in its narration, it is contemporary in its subject -- the devastating history of Afghanistan over the past thirty years. As emotionally gripping as it is tender, The Kite Runner is an unusual and powerful debut.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66aeda71229b88178cbfdaa6e438b747ff01e4f5","amp;dn":"kite+runner%2C+The+-+Khaled+Hosseini-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66aeda71229b88178cbfdaa6e438b747ff01e4f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,174,218,113,34,155,136,23,140,191,218,166,228,56,183,71,255,1,228,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
