The band is composed of bassist, keyboardist, and lead vocalist Geddy Lee, guitarist Alex Lifeson, and drummer and lyricist Neil Peart. The band and its membership went through a number of re-configurations between 1968 and 1974, achieving their current form when Peart replaced original drummer John Rutsey in July 1974, two weeks before the group\\'s first United States tour.\nRush has won a number of Juno Awards, and was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1994. Over their careers, the members of Rush have been acknowledged as some of the most proficient players on their respective instruments, with each band member winning numerous awards in magazine readers\\' polls. As a group, Rush possesses 24 gold records and 14 platinum (3 multi-platinum) records. Rush\\'s sales statistics place them third behind The Beatles and The Rolling Stones for the most consecutive gold or platinum studio albums by a rock band. Rush also ranks 79th in U.S. album sales with 25 million units. Although total worldwide album sales are not calculated by any single entity, as of 2004 several industry sources estimated Rush\\'s total worldwide album sales at over 40 million units.\n\n.: Rush Group :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img190.imageshack.us/img190/3539/rushsmall.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img190.imageshack.us/img190/3539/rushsmall.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums :.\n\nStudio albums\n1974 - Rush (The Rush Remasters) @320\n1975 - Caress Of Steel @320\n1975 - Fly By Night @320\n1976 - 2112 (The Rush Remasters) @320\n1977 - A Farewell To Kings @320\n1978 - Hemispheres @320\n1980 - Permanent Waves (The Rush Remasters) @320\n1981 - Moving Pictures @320\n1982 - Signals @320\n1984 - Grace Under Pressure @320\n1985 - Power Windows (The Rush Remasters) @320\n1987 - Hold Your Fire @320\n1989 - Presto (The Rush Remasters) @320\n1991 - Roll The Bones @320\n1993 - Counterparts (The Rush Remasters) @320\n1996 - Test For Echo @320\n2002 - Vapor Trails Less Vapor, The Bubba Skarda Remaster @320\n2004 - Feedback (EP) @320\n2007 - Snakes &amp; Arrows @320\n\nLive albums\n1976 - All The World\\'s A Stage @320\n1981 - Exit...Stage Left (The Rush Remasters) @320\n1989 - A Show Of Hands @320\n1998 - Different Stages (3 CD) @320\n2003 - Rush In Rio (2 CD) @320\n2005 - R30-30th Anniversary World Tour (2 CD) @320\n2008 - Snakes &amp; Arrows Live (2 CD) @320\n\nCompilation albums\n1997 - Retrospective, Vol. 1 (1974-1980) @320\n1997 - Retrospective, Vol. 2 (1981-1987) @320\n2003 - The Spirit Of Radio Greatest Hits 1974-1987 @320\n2006 - Gold (2 CD) @320\n2009 - Retrospective 3 (1989-2008 CD+DVD) @320\nCD\nDVD (VIDEO_TS)\n\nTribute albums\n1996 - Working Man - A Tribute To Rush @320\n\nBootleg albums\n1974 (Aug 26) Return To Cleveland (2 CD) @320\n1976 (May 30) One Hot Night - Springfield @320\n1976 (Oct 25) 2112 Seattle Night @320\n1978 (Dec 02) Buenas Nochas!
