This series reveals how the world we live in today was entirely shaped by the railways, charting the glorious evolution of rail transportation and how it left its mark on our lives, landscape and culture. Hop aboard an old-fashioned locomotive and set off down the line to a new part of the country with the established stars of the BBC Two Farm series, Peter Ginn, Alex Langlands and Ruth Goodman who have immersed themselves in the story of how the railways made us what we are today. Our team of experts also get their hands dirty - driving the train, working in the station, manning the signal box and learning how to run every aspect of a 19th and early 20th century railway. This is a trip not to be missed.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  Part 1 \r\nThey begin by exploring how the introduction of steam railways in the early 19th century created a domestic revolution, from the way people lived to the food they ate. Arriving at Ffestiniog Railway in Snowdonia, they find out how millions of tons of slate were moved down the mountain, while underground, Alex experiences the brutal conditions face by miners in the Llechwedd Quarry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e3/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/47/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e8/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f8/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6c/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a0/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e2/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/06/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/29/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e5/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3e/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d0/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0d/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/45/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/92/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/11/Full-Steam-Ahead-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video: Bitrate: CRF-22 (~2817 Kbps)\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 161 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59 mins,\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.22 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07lpglf","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44d0263696da10edbde731964aec786458f4af1b","amp;dn":"BBC+Full+Steam+Ahead+1of6+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44d0263696da10edbde731964aec786458f4af1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,208,38,54,150,218,16,237,189,231,49,150,74,236,120,100,88,244,175,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
