The film ties together the various ancient anecdotes with a storyline bounded by the capture in Austria of Richard the Lionheart (Ian Hunter) on one end and Richard's triumphant return to England on the other. Robin Hood is already an outlaw at the outset of the film, while Maid Marian (Olivia de Havilland) is initially part of the enemy camp, as one of Prince John's (Claude Rains) entourage. Marian warms up to Robin's fight against injustice (and to Robin himself), eventually becoming a trusted ally. James Cagney was originally announced for the role of Robin Hood, just before Cagney left Warner Bros. in a salary dispute. William Keighley was the original director, but he worked too slowly to suit the tight production schedule and was replaced by Michael Curtiz (both men receive screen credit). A lengthy opening jousting sequence was shot but removed from the final print; portions of this sequence show up as stock footage in the 1957 Warners film The Story of Mankind. The chestnut-colored Palomino horse ridden by de Havilland in the Sherwood Forest scenes later gained screen stardom as Roy Rogers' Trigger. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029843/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0029843/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSubtitles:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-6775&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-6775&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nDirectors:\nMichael Curtiz\nWilliam Keighley\n\n\n\n\tErrol Flynn\t... \tRobin Hood\n\n\tOlivia de Havilland\t... \tMaid Marian\n\tBasil Rathbone\t... \tSir Guy of Gisbourne\n\n\tClaude Rains\t... \tPrince John\n\tPatric Knowles\t... \tWill Scarlett","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9888190e90e388c512b4eee57efbff157649ee4c","amp;dn":"The+Adventures+of+Robin+Hood++%281938%29++Errol+Flynn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9888190e90e388c512b4eee57efbff157649ee4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,136,25,14,144,227,136,197,18,180,238,229,126,251,255,21,118,73,238,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
