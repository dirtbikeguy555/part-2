If you are looking for the definitive  version, you need to obtain the Letterboxed ntsc Laserdisc  edition. (from which this Avi file was ripped. I Have made minor alterations in aspect ratio, but this is about as good as it gets. Your not good going to have the quality of a DVD rip because LD dose have its limitations. But, this is far better than a VHS rip; and the best you'll get till a DVD is released.)\n\n[b]PLOT[/b]: Romania, 1942, a detachment of the German Army is sent to gaurd a mysterious Romanian citadel located on a strategic mountain pass. When soldiers begin to be mysteriously murdered, the SS arrives to deal with what is thought to be partisan activity. What the SS finds, however, is an evil force trapped within the Keep and a force which will do anything in order to escape.\n\n[b]NOTE[/b]: One of the strongest aspects of this undeniably &quot;odd&quot; film is the fantastic soundtrack score composed by German instrumental legends Tangerine Dream.\n\n[b]IMDB[/b]: [url]http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085780/[/url]\n[b]WIKI[/b]: [url]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Keep_%28film%29[/url]\n\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFormat profile                   : OpenDML\nFile size                        : 694 MiB\nDuration                         : 1h 31mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 056 Kbps\nWriting application              : AVI-Mux GUI 1.17.8.3, Feb 16 201019:42:50\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 31mn\nBit rate                         : 925 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 320 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 2.25:1\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nResolution                       : 8 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.161\nStream size                      : 607 MiB (88%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nFormat_Settings_ModeExtension    : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 31mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 84.0 MiB (12%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 795 ms (19.88 video frames)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 216 ms\nTitle                            : VTS_01_1 T80 2_0ch 256Kbps DELAY 0ms\nWriting library                  : LAME3.98r\nEncoding settings                : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 -b 128\n\n[u][i][b]Please don't expect to get the movie in a few minutes, I only have limited bandwidth.
