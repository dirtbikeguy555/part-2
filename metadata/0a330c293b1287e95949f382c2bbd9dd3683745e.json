Now, only plot quests will generate bosses.)\n    Buffs now update when torch level changes\n    Some Dodges now properly display as Misses\n    Removed waits when applying effects that did not have results (for example, curing blight on a hero that isn't blighted)\n    Fixed battle icon rendering gold when being ambushed\n    Selective RNG shaping and tuning to prevent unintended edge cases\n    Weapon icons visually upgrade as you increase weapon level (armor icons will be coming in a future patch)\n    Click to dismiss a hero 'bark' - toggle in the Options screen\n    Added logic to avoid edge case bark stacking delays\n    Health bars animate to show damage more clearly\n    Damage Over Time (DoT) is now properly applied without delay at the start of an enemy turn saving 1.8 secs of hang time per DoT'd enemy!\n    Various save file fixes\n    Improved save recovery\n    Windows XP support *\n    OpenGL 2.1 support *","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a330c293b1287e95949f382c2bbd9dd3683745e","amp;dn":"Darkest+Dungeon+Build+7907","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a330c293b1287e95949f382c2bbd9dd3683745e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,51,12,41,59,18,135,233,89,73,243,130,194,187,217,221,54,131,116,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
