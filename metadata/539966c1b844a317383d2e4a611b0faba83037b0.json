If you ever want to remove the\r\npre-activated/re-activating portion of this setup, you just\r\ndelete the $oem$ folder inside sources within the iso.\r\n\r\nI've left my usual scripts folder in the iso, but being as this\r\nis a fairly new Win10 build, I don't know if all of them function\r\nas intended. The KMS Gen ticket block reg key is already set by\r\nthe KMS_VL_ALL script. I'll include a link to abbodi's project\r\nin case you wish to try to understand more.\r\n\r\nCredits:\r\nabbodi1406, qewlpal - KMS Activator\r\nmurphy78 - Integration, ISO design, Script and testing\r\n\r\nEnjoy,\r\nmurphy78 :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:539966c1b844a317383d2e4a611b0faba83037b0","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Windows+10+Enterprise+x32+14393.10+en-US+Activated","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"539966c1b844a317383d2e4a611b0faba83037b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,153,102,193,184,68,163,23,56,61,46,74,97,27,15,171,168,48,55,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
