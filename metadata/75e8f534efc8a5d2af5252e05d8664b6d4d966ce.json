It introduces patterns both conceptually and through the application of many classic &quot;Gang of Four&quot; design patterns to the development of a case study application written in Java.\n\nDouglas C. Schmidt, Professor of Computer Science at Vanderbilt University's School of Engineering, provides students and professional programmers with 4+ hours of example and case study based video learning on the concepts and application of design patterns. Design Patterns in Java LiveLessons describes how to master the complexity of developing software by learning and applying object-oriented patterns and frameworks. It centers on a case study that showcases pattern- and object-oriented design and programming techniques using Java. This case study will help you evaluate the limitations of alternative software development methods (such as algorithm decomposition) and demonstrate by example how patterns and object-orientation help to alleviate such limitations. More than a dozen patterns from the book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (the so-called &quot;Gang of Four&quot;' book) are applied in the case study.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75e8f534efc8a5d2af5252e05d8664b6d4d966ce","amp;dn":"InformIT+-+Design+Patterns+in+Java+LiveLessons","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75e8f534efc8a5d2af5252e05d8664b6d4d966ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,232,245,52,239,200,165,210,175,82,82,224,93,134,100,182,212,217,102,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
