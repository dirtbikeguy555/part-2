But between 1981 and 1999, they released countless B-sides, non-LP singles, and EPs, resulting in a sprawling discography ripe for a compilation. So, in 1999, the Beasties released the two-disc compilation The Sounds of Science, which covers every incarnation of the band from Pollywog Stew to Hello Nasty. Inevitably, some well-known songs are missing -- only three cuts from Licensed to Ill are here, and their breakthrough single &quot;Rock Hard&quot; had to be pulled when AC/DC refused permission for a sample. Ultimately, that doesn&amp;#039;t matter, since the set captures the spirit of the Beasties so well. Usually, compilations that don&amp;#039;t follow chronological order are a little muddled, but The Sounds of Science benefits from its jumbled sequencing, since it emphasizes the band&amp;#039;s astonishing musical reach and consistency. After all, every album since Paul&amp;#039;s Boutique has followed a similarly unpredictable pattern, as the group moved from hip-hop to punk to funk to jazz. What&amp;#039;s remarkable about The Sounds of Science is that it has all the obvious suspects, but since they&amp;#039;re rubbing singles with album tracks and B-sides like &quot;Skills to Pay the Bills,&quot; two outtakes from the abandoned country album, alternate versions of &quot;Jimmy James&quot; and &quot;Three MC&amp;#039;s and One DJ,&quot; Fatboy Slim&amp;#039;s brilliant remix of &quot;Body Movin&amp;#039;,&quot; goofs like the Biz Markie-sung cover of &quot;Benny and the Jets,&quot; and the excellent new single &quot;Alive,&quot; it all sounds fresh. There&amp;#039;s much more than hits here, but The Sounds of Science achieves something most anthologies don&amp;#039;t: it summarizes the attitude and spirit of the band, while offering some new revelations even for dedicated fans.
