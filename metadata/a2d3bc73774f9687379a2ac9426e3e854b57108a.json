Abigail enjoys long naps in fairy-filled glades, running through corridors in tragically romantic haunted castles, and drinking goblet after goblet of spiced wine.\n===============\n\n\nSophie Scaife almost ran away once, trading her ticket to college for a ticket to Tokyo. But a delayed flight and a hot one-night stand with a stranger changed her mind, putting her firmly on track to a coveted position at a New York fashion magazine.\n\nWhen the irresistible stranger from that one incredible night turns out to be her new boss Ã¢â‚¬â€œ billionaire and publishing magnate Neil Elwood Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sophie canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t resist the chance to rekindle the spark between themÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and the opportunity to explore her submissive side with the most Dominant man sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever known.\n\nNeil is the only man who has ever understood SophieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s need to submit in the bedroom, and the only man who has ever satisfied those desires. When their scorching, no-strings-attached sexual relationship becomes something more, Sophie must choose between her career and heartÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ or risk losing them both.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2d3bc73774f9687379a2ac9426e3e854b57108a","amp;dn":"Abigail+Barnette%2C+The+Boss+%28erotic+romance%29+epub+%5Bdovah%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2d3bc73774f9687379a2ac9426e3e854b57108a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,211,188,115,119,79,150,135,55,154,42,201,66,110,62,133,75,87,16,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
