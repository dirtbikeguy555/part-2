You play a freelance spy who takes jobs from his clients to break\n\n          into high security buildings and steal sensitive data.\n\n\n                                  I + N + S + T + A + L + L\n\n\n          1 Extract archives, mount .iso and run setup\n\n          2 Install the game\n\n          3 Play and have a fun! \n\n\n                             G + R + O + U + P   N + O + T + E + S\n\n\n          Recently our releases with cracked SteamWorks protection got nuked for:\n\n         \n          2w521jq.jpg&quot;\n\n          Well, we used 4 header-files for some hints, e.g. from SteamNetworking.h\n\n          and Stea COGENTs emulator source on 2 our releases, because we\n\n          had trouble making them to work properly.\n\n          Although we used these few header files they are still modified, and the\n\n          actual sourcecode is our own. COGENTs leaked and upped in public steamemu\n\n          doesnt actually work for a tons of newer  games (e.g. caused by\n\n          RemoteStorage, SteamUtils and some other interfaces) and somehow ours does\n\n          (see: Resident.Evil.Revelations.Update.2-WaLMaRT)\n\n          But in general you cant say its stolen. As you can simple google Open-\n\n          SteamWorks and voila. Almost all info you need to make own emulator is\n\n          there \n\n          and modified a little it: e.g. int32 -&gt; DWORD&gt;.\n\n          The only 2 releases that have a string from a headerfile we accidentaly\n\n          used are:\n\n          Resident.Evil.Revelations.Update.2-WaLMaRT\n          iBomber.Defense.Pacific-WaLMaRT\n\n          The rest didnt even use that particular header file and also contain no\n\n          COGENT strings . So all these releases would be an inva-\n\n          lid nuke anyway:\n\n          Patrician.IV.Steam.Special.Edition-WaLMaRT\n          Metro.Last.Light.Update.4.Repack-WaLMaRT\n          Gothic.3.Forsaken.Gods.Enhanced.Edition-WaLMaRT\n          Surgeon.Simulator.2013.Steam.Edition-WaLMaRT\n\n          As a bonus, we also included a screenshot with the folder containing our\n\n          sourcecode as proof. see: http://i.imgur.com/zoR5IA4.png\n\n\n                                      N + O + T + E + S\n\n\n                                     SMELLS LIKE A HONEY!\n\n\n                                G + R + E + E + T + I + G + S\n\n\n                      VOMIT  DOCUMENT  EAT  BRD  AiR  FiCO  XFORCE\n\n\n                                R + E + C + R + U + I + T + S\n\n\n                 LOOKING FOR A NICE SECURE PRIVATE 100MBIT+ AFFIL.
