It was largely filmed during the concerts running from 19 August 1988 through 23 August 1988 at the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York, with some additional footage from 21Ã¢â‚¬â€œ22 June 1988 at the Place d'Armes of the ChÃƒÂ¢teau de Versailles, Versailles, France (used to provide the performance of &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot;. Note that the Versailles show was only used for some of the video footage. The audio is from Nassau). It was released on VHS and Laserdisc formats. It has never been officially released on DVD. Each song in common with the CD release uses the same performance (except &quot;Run Like Hell&quot; and &quot;On the Turning Away&quot;, the latter of which has a different guitar solo at the end) with the audience a little higher in the mix. The remaining three songsÃ¢â‚¬â€&quot;Signs of Life&quot;, &quot;On the Run&quot;, and &quot;One Slip&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€all come from Nassau as well. The two tracks from the A Momentary Lapse of Reason LP were recorded on 23 August 1988, while &quot;On the Run&quot; was recorded on 19 August 1988. The determining factor in figuring out which of the remaining songs was from which night was the clothing differences, most notably which tie was being worn by Jon Carin.\n\n\nGeneral:\n\nComplete name : Delicate Sound of Thunder-1.m4v\nFormat : MPEG-4\nFormat profile : Base Media / Version 2\nCodec ID : mp42\nFile size : 868 MiB\nDuration : 100 mins (total)\nOverall bit rate : 2 219 Kbps\nEncoded date : UTC 2014-11-19 23:08:05\nTagged date : UTC 2014-11-19 23:43:27\nWriting application : HandBrake 0.9.9\n\n\nVideo:\n\nID : 1\nFormat : AVC\nFormat/Info : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;5d15343a351d1169736c&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames : 5 frames\nCodec ID : avc1\nCodec ID/Info : Advanced Video Coding\nBit rate : 1 959 Kbps\nWidth : 700 pixels\nHeight : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 4:3\nFrame rate mode : Constant\nFrame rate : 29.970 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.195\nStream size : 766 MiB (88%)\nWriting library : x264 core 130 r2273 b3065e6\nEncoding settings : (see text file)\nEncoded date : UTC 2014-11-19 23:08:05\nTagged date : UTC 2014-11-19 23:43:27\nColor primaries : BT.601 NTSC\nTransfer characteristics : BT.709\nMatrix coefficients : BT.601\n\n\nAudio:\n\nID : 2\nFormat : AC-3\nFormat/Info : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness : Big\nCodec ID : ac-3\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 256 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nChannel positions : Front: L R\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth : 16 bits\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 100 MiB (12%)\nEncoded date : UTC 2014-11-19 23:08:05\nTagged date : UTC 2014-11-19 23:43:26","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c011ce4a6e5a0cefdaf3ab47d6bef4328ec1b6b","amp;dn":"Delicate+Sound+of+Thunder+-Concert+Video-+LDRip+x264+-+%5B%3DFaith%3D%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c011ce4a6e5a0cefdaf3ab47d6bef4328ec1b6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,1,28,228,166,229,160,206,253,175,58,180,125,107,239,67,40,236,27,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
