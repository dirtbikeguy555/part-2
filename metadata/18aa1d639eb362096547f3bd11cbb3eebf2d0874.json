Exploring the cinematic quality and features offered by hybrid DSLRs, this book empowers the filmmaker to craft visually stunning images inexpensively.\n\nLearn to think more like a cinematographer than a videographer, whether shooting for a feature, short fiction, documentary, video journalism, or even a wedding. DSLR Cinema offers insight into different shooting styles, real-world tips and techniques, and advice on postproduction workflow as it guides you in crafting a film-like look.\n\nCase studies feature an international cast of cutting edge DSLR shooters today, including Philip Bloom (England), Bernardo Uzeda (Brazil), Rii Schroer (Germany), Jeremy Ian Thomas (United States), Shane Hurlbut, ASC (United States), and Po Chan (Hong Kong). Their films are examined in detail, exploring how each exemplifies great storytelling, exceptional visual character, and how you can push the limits of your DSLR.\n\n* Inside perspective from a master class of DSLR shooters * Emphasis on visual technique related to great stories * Progression from the fundamental tools needed by DSLR shooters to advanced techniques * Wide array of technical information: composition, lighting, camera movement, lenses, audio, postproduction workflow, and more * Lavish, full-color illustrations showcase real world examples from real DSLR videos * Companion Web site shows you the films discussed in the book, and more\n\n\n# Paperback: 320 pages\n# Publisher: Focal Press; 1 edition (November 1, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0240815513\n# ISBN-13: 978-0240815510","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18aa1d639eb362096547f3bd11cbb3eebf2d0874","amp;dn":"DSLR+Cinema%3A+Crafting+the+Film+Look+with+Video%2C1st+Ed+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18aa1d639eb362096547f3bd11cbb3eebf2d0874","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,170,29,99,158,179,98,9,101,71,243,189,17,203,179,238,191,45,8,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
