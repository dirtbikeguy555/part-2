Waller [epub]\r\n\r\nIn May 1940, as Nazi panzers overran the Netherlands, Felix Kersten received a summons he dared not refuse. A successful and prosperous physical therapist who had ministered to the Dutch royal family, Kersten was &quot;asked&quot; to forsake his adopted home in the Netherlands and become personal physician to Nazi ReichsfÃ¼hrer Heinrich Himmler.\r\n\r\nWhile others might have spent the ensuing years paying fearful obeisance to this monstrous and unpredictable master, Kersten discovered that he had both the means and the courage to manipulate the surprisingly naive Himmler. In doing so, he saved thousands of lives and actually persuaded Himmler to join in a plot to overthrow Himmler's hero, Adolf Hitler","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7da505965ec71ff2a8e192138883ee0105a0314b","amp;dn":"The+Devil%26rsquo%3Bs+Doctor%3A+The+Plot+to+Turn+Himmler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7da505965ec71ff2a8e192138883ee0105a0314b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,165,5,150,94,199,31,242,168,225,146,19,136,131,238,1,5,160,49,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
