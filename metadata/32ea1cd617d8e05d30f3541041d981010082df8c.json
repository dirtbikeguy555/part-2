One woman will transform herself to gain power. And no one will emerge unscathed...\n\nThorvald Spear wakes in a hospital to find he's been brought back from the dead. What's more, he died in a human vs. alien war that ended a century ago. Spear had been trapped on a world surrounded by hostile Prador forces, but Penny Royal, the AI inside the rescue ship sent to provide backup, turned rogue, annihilating friendly forces in a frenzy of destruction and killing Spear. One hundred years later the AI is still on the loose, and Spear vows for revenge at any cost.\n\nIsobel Satomi ran a successful crime syndicate, but after competitors attacked she needed power and protection. Negotiating with Penny Royal, she got more than she bargained for: Turning part-AI herself gave Isobel frightening power, but the upgrades hid a horrifying secret, and the dark AI triggered a transformation that has been turning her into something far from humanÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nSpear hires Isobel to track Penny Royal across worlds to its last known whereabouts. But he cheats her in the process and quickly finds himself in her crosshairs. As Isobel continues to evolve into a monstrous predator, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clear her rage will eventually win out over reason. Will Spear finish his hunt before he himself becomes the hunted?\n\nDark Intelligence is the explosive first novel in a brand new trilogy from military SF master Neal Asher and a new chapter in his epic Polity universe.\n\n\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32ea1cd617d8e05d30f3541041d981010082df8c","amp;dn":"Neal+Asher+-+Dark+Intelligence+%28Transformation+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32ea1cd617d8e05d30f3541041d981010082df8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,234,28,214,23,216,224,93,48,243,84,16,65,217,129,1,0,130,223,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
