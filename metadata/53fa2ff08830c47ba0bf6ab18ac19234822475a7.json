Itâ€™s possible with Cython, the compiler and hybrid programming language used by foundational packages such as NumPy, and prominent in projects including Pandas, h5py, and scikits-learn. In this practical guide, youâ€™ll learn how to use Cython to improve Pythonâ€™s performanceâ€”up to 3000xâ€” and to wrap C and C++ libraries in Python with ease.\r\n\r\nAuthor Kurt Smith takes you through Cythonâ€™s capabilities, with sample code and in-depth practice exercises. If youâ€™re just starting with Cython, or want to go deeper, youâ€™ll learn how this language is an essential part of any performance-oriented Python programmerâ€™s arsenal.\r\n\r\n* Use Cythonâ€™s static typing to speed up Python code\r\n\r\n* Gain hands-on experience using Cython features to boost your numeric-heavy Python\r\n\r\n* Create new types with Cythonâ€”and see how fast object-oriented programming in Python can be\r\n\r\n* Effectively organize Cython code into separate modules and packages without sacrificing performance\r\n\r\n* Use Cython to give Pythonic interfaces to C and C++ libraries\r\nOptimize code with Cythonâ€™s runtime and compile-time profiling tools\r\n\r\n* Use Cythonâ€™s prange function to parallelize loops transparently with OpenMP","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53fa2ff08830c47ba0bf6ab18ac19234822475a7","amp;dn":"Cython+-+A+Guide+For+Python+Programmers+-+1st+Ed+%282015%29+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53fa2ff08830c47ba0bf6ab18ac19234822475a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,250,47,240,136,48,196,123,160,191,106,177,138,193,146,52,130,36,117,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
