She schemes to replace him on the throne with his stepbrother and her submissive young son Seong-won (Kim Dong-wook). Indifferent to his motherÃ¢Â€â„¢s plans, the timid prince falls in love at first sight with Hwa-yeon (Jo Yeo-jeong), an aristocratÃ¢Â€â„¢s daughter, who has already found love with Kwon-yoo (Kim Min-joon), a commoner. The king is eventually poisoned to death by the queen mother, who is desperate to be in power. Hwa-yeon is moved to a closely watched humble residence, with the queen mother planning to assassinate Hwa-yeon and her son to secure her position in the palace.\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\n\r\nFormat.......: MP4\r\nFile Size....: 1.99 GB\r\nDuration.....:2hr 03min\r\nBitrate......: 2300\r\nSource.......: BLURAY\r\nEncoder&quot;.......DDL\r\nSAMPLE.........
