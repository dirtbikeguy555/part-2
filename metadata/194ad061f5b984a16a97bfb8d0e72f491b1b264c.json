It lacks the editing power of a general-purpose editor such as Adobe Premiere, but is streamlined for fast linear operations over video. It has batch-processing capabilities for processing large numbers of files and can be extended with third-party video filters. It is mainly geared toward processing AVI files, although it can read MPEG-1 and also handle sets of BMP images.\n\n\nWhat's New in version 1.9.8:\n- Fixed occasional hang with certain conversion paths from 8-bit (256 color) to YCbCr formats.\n- Fixed bug where two curve points on top of each other in the curve editor didn't save properly in script files.\n- Fixed decompression error in IFF ANIM decoder when entire bitplanes were skipped.\n- Filters: Fixed glitches in IVTC pattern in the first five frames of video.\n- Filters: Fixed occasional crash when 3D acceleration is enabled and the 3D device is lost.\n- Filters: Fixed bugs where the curve display would either show the wrong frames or fail to step in certain circumstances.\n- Filters: Blends are no longer allowed on filters where the input and output have different formats; this didn't work and produced a corrupted image.\n- Filters: Fixed crash in smoother filter with MMX disabled.\n- Decoders: Fixed crash in Motion JPEG decoder on certain kinds of corrupt data.\n- Frameserver: Fixed random crash issue related to stream format structure.\n- Hex editor: Fixed bug where 'O' and 'S' activated open and save commands instead of Ctrl+O and Ctrl+S.\n\n\nOS: Win 9x/ME/NT/2K/XP/2K3/Vista/7\nRelease Date: 24/12/2009\nBonus: VirtualDub-1.9.8-AMD64, VirtualDub-1.9.8-src","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:194ad061f5b984a16a97bfb8d0e72f491b1b264c","amp;dn":"VirtualDub+1.9.8+Stable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"194ad061f5b984a16a97bfb8d0e72f491b1b264c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,74,208,97,245,185,132,161,106,151,191,184,208,231,47,73,27,27,38,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
