While working as a marriage counselor for more than 30 years, he identified five love languages: Words of Affirmation, Quality Time, Receiving Gifts, Acts of Service, and Physical Touch. In a friendly, often humorous style, he unpacks each one. Some husbands or wives may crave focused attention; another needs regular praise. Gifts are highly important to one spouse, while another sees fixing a leaky faucet, ironing a shirt, or cooking a meal as filling their &quot;love tank.&quot; Some partners might find physical touch makes them feel valued: holding hands, giving back rubs, and sexual contact. Chapman illustrates each love language with real-life examples from his counseling practice.\nHow do you discover your spouseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and your own Ã¢â‚¬â€œ love language? ChapmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s short questionnaires are one of several ways to find out. Throughout the book, he also includes application questions that can be answered more extensively in the beautifully detailed companion leather journal (an exclusiveset). Each section of the journal corresponds with a chapter from the book, offering opportunities for deeper reflection on your marriage.\n\nAlthough some readers may find choosing to love a spouse that they no longer even like Ã¢â‚¬â€œhoping the feelings of affection will follow laterÃ¢â‚¬â€œ a difficult concept to swallow, Chapman promises that the results will be worth the effort. &quot;Love is a choice,&quot; says Chapman. &quot;And either partner can start the process today.&quot; --Cindy Crosby.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10468553ba439267a739ee41202eab1cd78d2136","amp;dn":"The+5+Love+Languages+-+The+Secret+to+Love+That+Lasts+%28Epub%2CMobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10468553ba439267a739ee41202eab1cd78d2136","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,70,133,83,186,67,146,103,167,57,238,65,32,46,171,28,215,141,33,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
