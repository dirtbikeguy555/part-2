Read Forbes today for rigorous, to-the-point business analysis.\r\n\r\nForbes (/fÉ”Ërbz/) is an American business magazine. Published bi-weekly, it features original articles on finance, industry, investing, and marketing topics. Forbes also reports on related subjects such as technology, communications, science, and law. Its headquarters is located in Jersey City, New Jersey. Primary competitors in the national business magazine category include Fortune and Bloomberg Businessweek. The magazine is well known for its lists and rankings, including its lists of the richest Americans (the Forbes 400) and rankings of world's top companies (the Forbes Global 2000). Another well-known list by the magazine is the The World's Billionaires list.\r\n\r\nThe motto of Forbes magazine is &quot;The Capitalist Tool&quot;.[3] Its chairman and editor-in-chief is Steve Forbes, and its CEO is Mike Perlis.\r\n\r\nForbes.com is part of Forbes Digital, a division of Forbes Media LLC. Forbes's holdings include a portion of RealClearPolitics. Together these sites reach more than 27 million unique visitors each month. Forbes.com employs the slogan &quot;Home Page For The World's Business Leaders&quot; and sometimes claims to be the world's most widely visited business web site.[24] The 2009 Times report said that, while &quot;one of the top five financial sites by traffic [throwing] off an estimated $70 million to $80 million a year in revenue, [it] never yielded the hoped-for public offering&quot;.[12]\r\n\r\nForbes.com uses a &quot;contributor model&quot; in which a wide network of &quot;contributors&quot; writes and publishes articles directly on the website.[25] Contributors are paid based on traffic to their Forbes.com pages; the site has received contributions from over 2,500 individuals, and some contributors have earned over US$100,000, according to the company.[25] Forbes currently allows advertisers to publish blog posts on its website alongside regular editorial content through a program called AdVoice, which accounts for more than 10 percent its digital revenue.[26] Forbes.com also publishes subscription investment newsletters, and an online guide to web sites, Best of the Web.\r\n\r\nDavid Churbuck founded Forbes's web site in 1996. The company's current chief executive officer is Mike Perlis; the current chief product officer is Lewis D'vorkin; the current editor of the magazine is Randall Lane. The site uncovered Stephen Glass's journalistic fraud in The New Republic in 1998, an article that drew attention to internet journalism. At the peak of media coverage of alleged Toyota sudden unintended acceleration in 2010 it exposed the California &quot;runaway Prius&quot; as a hoax, as well as running five other articles by Michael Fumento challenging the entire media premise of Toyotas suddenly gone bad. The site, like the magazine, publishes many lists focusing on billionaires and their possessions, especially expensive homes, a critical aspect of the website's apparent popularity.\r\n\r\n=======================================\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/shtihl22\r\n\r\n=======================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7540b44bb3124c79127fe149f4a62211c4c6e723","amp;dn":"Forbes+USA+-+August%2C+2016+True+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7540b44bb3124c79127fe149f4a62211c4c6e723","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,64,180,75,179,18,76,121,18,127,225,73,244,166,34,17,196,198,231,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
