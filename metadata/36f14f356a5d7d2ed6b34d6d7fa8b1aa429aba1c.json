(2011)\n\n\n\n\nAdvance copy.\n\n\nThis title will be released on July 12, 2011.\n\n\n\n\n\nMulti-platinum rock band, Incubus, have re-engaged renowned producer Brendan O&quot;Brien (Pearl Jam, Rage Against The Machine, Bob Dylan) to produce the band&quot;s sixth studio album, If Not Now, When? The highly anticipated new album features lead single &quot;Adolescents&quot;, an inimitable showcase of the band's frenetic rock roots. Delving further into the album, tracks like 'Promises, Promises' and 'Friends &amp; Lovers' reveal new levels of elegance, space, and psychedelia in the band's ever evolving sound.\n\n\nIncubus became one of the most popular alt-metal bands of the new millennium, setting themselves apart from a crowded field with a tireless touring ethic and a broad musical palette. Formed in 1991 in the San Fernando Valley suburb of Calabasas, CA, the band's early lineup was comprised of tenth-grade classmates Brandon Boyd (vocals, percussion), Mike Einziger (guitar), Alex Katunich (aka Dirk Lance; bass), and JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Pasillas (drums). Their early funk-metal sound was heavily influenced by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but broadened over the next few years to incorporate thrash, rap-metal, post-grunge rock, and grinding alt-metal ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  la Korn or the Deftones. By the time the musicians had graduated from high school, they had already been playing all-ages shows around Southern California on a regular basis. In 1995, Incubus added hip-hop turntablist DJ Lyfe (aka Gavin Koppel) to their lineup and recorded the independently released album Fungus Amongus. That, coupled with a strong local following, helped the band earn a deal with the Epic Records subsidiary Immortal.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art/ID Tags\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.If Not Now, When\n02.Promises, Promises\n03.Friends And Lovers\n04.Thieves\n05.Isadore\n06.The Original\n07.Defiance\n08.In The Company Of Wolves\n09.Switchblade\n10.Adolescents\n11.Tomorrow's Food\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36f14f356a5d7d2ed6b34d6d7fa8b1aa429aba1c","amp;dn":"Incubus+-+If+Not+Now%2C+When%3F+%282011%29+mp3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36f14f356a5d7d2ed6b34d6d7fa8b1aa429aba1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,241,79,53,106,93,125,46,214,179,77,109,127,168,177,170,66,154,186,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
