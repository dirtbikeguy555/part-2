Adguard removes all the annoying ads, blocks loading of dangerous websites, and will not allow anyone to track your activities on the Internet.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n- Comfort and safety\r\n- You will be amazed how much more comfortable and safer the Internet will be after you install Adguard.\r\n- Adguard for Windows\r\n- Short list of important changes: greatly reduced memory usage, we introduced convenient addition of new ad filters, integration with WoT is now a separate extension, added support for new browsers, fixed conflicts with popular programs and defects in the processing of requests and more.\r\n- Memory usage reduction\r\n- We have significantly optimized memory usage. Now, even if you use an old computer or a weak netbook, Adguard will work silently in a background without slowing down your device. We compared memory footprint with the one of the preceding version. And we must say showed a result several times lower.\r\n- More ad filters\r\n- In addition, Adguard has became an even more comprehensive program. Now users can install any ad filters. What does it mean? In addition to the filters that are already installed in Adguard by default, you can add third-party ones, such as a list of filters that allow Adguard to block ads in different segments of the Internet â€“ websites in different languages, in particular. All of this can be done directly in the program, simply by selecting a filter you want and clicking on the â€œAdd selectedâ€ button.\r\n- Displaying the possible danger\r\n- Integration with Web of Trust is now brought out in the separate extension, which can be disabled. Also a warning when visiting a suspicious website has changed. With the help of WoT, our Adguard is able to notify you instantly about the reputation of websites and show the reasons for which the site is considered to be suspicious. â€œCategories of suspicionâ€ can be, in particular: scam, potentially illegal, misleading claims or unethical, poor customer experience, privacy risks and others.\r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\n\r\n1.
