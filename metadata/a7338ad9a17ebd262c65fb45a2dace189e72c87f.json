No regenerating health bars. No conveniently placed ammo drops. It's just you, outnumbered and outgunned, grabbing the weapons of fallen enemies to shoot, slice, and maneuver through a hurricane of slow-motion bullets.\r\nWith its unique, stylized graphics SUPERHOT finally adds something new and disruptive to the FPS genre. SUPERHOTâ€™s polished, minimalist visual language helps you concentrate on the most important - on the fluidity of gameplay and the cinematic beauty of destruction.\r\nThirty months in the making. Thousands of hours put into development and design. From its humble origins in the 7 Day FPS game jam, through a hugely successful Kickstarter campaign to a plethora of awards and nominations from industry experts, SUPERHOT is a labor of love by itâ€™s independant, dedicated team and thousands of backers from all around the globe.\r\nEndless Mode - How long can you last against unyielding waves of enemies?\r\nChallenge Mode - Take on SUPERHOT with your bare hands, no restarts, timed runs, and more.\r\nReplay Editor - Edit and upload your best runs for all to see on Killstagram.com.\r\nExtras - Delve further into SUPERHOT with mini-games, ASCII art, and [redacted].\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: Windows 7 / 8 / 10\r\nProcessor: Intel Core2Quad Q6600 2,40 GHz\r\nMemory: 4 GB RAM\r\nGraphics: GeForce GTX 650 (1024 MB RAM) or better\r\nStorage: 3 GB available space\r\nMouse, Keyboard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7338ad9a17ebd262c65fb45a2dace189e72c87f","amp;dn":"SUPERHOT+%28v2.5.0.9%29+%5BGOG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7338ad9a17ebd262c65fb45a2dace189e72c87f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,51,138,217,161,126,189,38,44,101,251,69,162,218,206,24,158,114,200,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
