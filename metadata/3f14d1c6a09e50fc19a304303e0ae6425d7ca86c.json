Eisold began moving away from hardcore in an attempt to make music entirely by himself; unable to play guitar, he began playing with vintage synths and effects pedals, crafting songs that ranged from harsh to romantic (often within the same track). Eisold released Cold Cave's debut album, the demo collection Coma Potion, in 2008 via his own publisher/label Heartworm Press as a limited edition of 100 copies. Later that year he issued a pair of EPs, The Trees Grew Emotions and Died on Dais and Painted Nails on Hospital. Cold Cave was even more prolific in 2009, with the project's first official full-length, Love Comes Close, arriving along with the singles Etsel &amp; Ruby and The Laurels of Erotomania, the limited-edition cassettes Electronic Dreams and Stars Explode, and the collection Cremations. Cold Cave also played that year's No Fun Festival with a lineup that included former Xiu Xiu member Caralee McElroy, Prurient's Dominick Fernow, and Heartworm Press co-manager Max G. Morton. For 2011's more expansive and polished Cherish the Light Years, Eisold collaborated with Fernow once again as well as keyboardist/vocalist Jennifer Clavin, Yeah Yeah Yeahs guitarist Nick Zinner, and former Chavez member Matt Sweeney on bass. Along with his bands and label/publishing house, Eisold also runs the bookstore and art space Juanita &amp; Juan's. \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tAlternative\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.The Great Pan Is Dead\n02.Pacing The The Church\n03.Confetti\n04.Catacombs\n05.Underworlds USA\n06.Icons Of Summer\n07.Alchemy And You\n08.Burning Sage\n09.Villians Of The Moon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n               ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f14d1c6a09e50fc19a304303e0ae6425d7ca86c","amp;dn":"Cold+Cave+-+Cherish+The+Light+Years+%282011%29+mp3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f14d1c6a09e50fc19a304303e0ae6425d7ca86c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,20,209,198,160,158,80,252,25,163,4,48,62,10,230,66,93,124,168,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
