In addition, it gives you modern advantages such as up to 32 voices of polyphony and up to 16-voice unison (with detune/spread function). Flexible external modulation settings and MIDI clock synchronization have also been added, giving you even greater creative potential.\n\nAlong with the provided Programs, a number of templates are included providing instant setups for running audio through the filter and other commonly-used functions.\n\n\nThe Polysix programmable six-voice polyphonic analog synthesizer was introduced in 1981. With a surprisingly full-sounding voice structure, chorus/phase/ensemble effects and performance functions such as chord memory, arpeggiator, and unison the Polysix became a world-wide hit. Its distinctive string and pad sounds are often heard to this day.\n\nIn addition to faithfully replicating the sound of the original, the Polysix software synthesizer also adds enhancements such as 32-voice polyphony (max), up to 16-voice unison (with detune/ spread function), flexible external modulation settings, MIDI clock synchronization, and a spread function that adjusts the spaciousness of the effects --- functionality that brings this classic synthesizer up to date for modern music production. \n\nThe interface provides reorganized knobs and switches that resurrect the Polysix in a contemporary &quot;rack-mountable&quot; form for even more intuitive operation and sound-creating versatility.\n\n\nThe Mono/Poly is KorgÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s four-VCO monophonic/polyphonic synthesizer that went on sale in 1981 and was considered the culmination of KorgÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s experience building analog synthesizers. It was released at the same time as the Polysix, and because of their capabilities as well as their price, these two instruments caused a revolution in the synthesizer world. Many musicians acclaimed the Mono/Poly as KorgÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best synthesizer yet, with a number of unique characteristics. It provided four VCOs, each providing adjustable pitch, waveform, octave, and level, which could be stacked together for massive sounds, or cycled through one at a time for constantly shifting timbres. Together with one VCF, one VCA, two EGs, and two MGs it provided a powerful yet accessible programming structure. But by far, its most signature characteristic was the Synchro and Cross Modulation functions that could run dual, or four-way cascaded modulation routings for creating revolutionary and aggressive tonal effects. It also featured the same futuristic Chord Memory and Arpeggiator functions as the Polysix.\n\nAll of this means that the Mono/Poly software synthesizer succeeds in establishing its own unique sound that cannot be produced by any previous analog synthesizer or any current analog modeling synthesizer.\n\n\nMDE-X is the exhilarating multi-effect plug-in first introduced in the Korg Legacy Collection. With the new Korg Legacy Collection Ã¢â‚¬â€œ DIGITAL EDITION, the MDE-X Version 1.2 is here, and now supports RTAS plug-in format, as well as VST and Audio Units formats. Featuring a low CPU drain design, MDE-X v1.2 provides 19 high quality effect types, derived from the technical innovation and research behind KorgÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Digital Recorders, TRITON synthesizers, and effects processors.\n\nEquipped with 128 immediately useful and editable effect programs, the MDE-X v1.2 can be used sound design, recording, mixdown sessions Ã¢â‚¬â€œ even live performance!\nDyna CompressorÃ£â‚¬ï¿½CompressorÃ£â‚¬ï¿½Multi Band LimiterÃ£â‚¬ï¿½Mastering LimiterÃ£â‚¬ï¿½OverDrive/Hi.Gain+WahÃ£â‚¬ï¿½4 Band EQÃ£â‚¬ï¿½Exciter/EnhancerÃ£â‚¬ï¿½Talking ModulatorÃ£â‚¬ï¿½DecimatorÃ£â‚¬ï¿½FlangerÃ£â‚¬ï¿½PhaserÃ£â‚¬ï¿½Polysix EnsembleÃ£â‚¬ï¿½MultiTap Chorus/DelayÃ£â‚¬ï¿½Stereo/Cross DelayÃ£â‚¬ï¿½LCR BPM DelayÃ£â‚¬ï¿½Reverb HallÃ£â‚¬ï¿½Reverb Smooth HallÃ£â‚¬ï¿½Reverb Wet PlateÃ£â‚¬ï¿½Reverb Dry Plate.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Please restart your computer before using the software.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo not make money with this software...\n\nRemember to BUY the stuff if you USE it.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nfuture-dada\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nthepiratebay.se - 1337x.to - flashtorrents.org - fenopy.se\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMMXIV (08).\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12fe90d1df329baf84ef466091b568d01711ed4a","amp;dn":"KORG+SYNTHESIZERS+OS+X+%2832-64bit%29+Team+AiR+%5Bdada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12fe90d1df329baf84ef466091b568d01711ed4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,254,144,209,223,50,155,175,132,239,70,96,145,181,104,208,23,17,237,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
