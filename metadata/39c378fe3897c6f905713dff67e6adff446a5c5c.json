Every engineer is required to obtain a basic knowledge of high temperature corrosion to prevent the colossal damage caused by it. This book contains chapters ranging from basic to advance topics to create an understanding of high temperature of various metals and alloys. With the emerging technologies such as nanotechnology, their role in controlling high temperature corrosion needs to be comprehended and new techniques developed to control high temperature corrosion. It is hoped that this book would fulfill these objectives and aspirations of the readers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39c378fe3897c6f905713dff67e6adff446a5c5c","amp;dn":"High+Temperature+Corrosion+-+Zaki+Ahmad","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39c378fe3897c6f905713dff67e6adff446a5c5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,195,120,254,56,151,198,249,5,113,61,255,103,230,173,255,68,106,92,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
