They are remembered above all for their hit &quot;In the Summertime&quot;. It remains their most successful and most instantly recognisable song. Their name was inspired by the poem Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer, from T. S. Eliot's Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats. According to Joseph Murrell's The Book of Golden Discs (1978 ), 'Mungomania' was possibly the most startling and unpredicted pop phenomenon to hit Britain since The Beatles. \n\n\nTracklist\n\n01-In The Summertime\n02-See Me\n03-Movin' On\n04-Maggie\n05-Mother Fucker Boogie\n06-Daddie's Brew\n07-Mighty Man\n08-Baby Let's Play House\n09-Johnny B.
