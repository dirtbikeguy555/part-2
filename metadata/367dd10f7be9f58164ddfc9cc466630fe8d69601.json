The primary purpose of Read My Lips is to educate women and men about the vulva and vagina in a manner that is smart, informative, and entertaining. Readers, both women and men alike, will come to think differently about women's genitals and become a little more curious and a lot more comfortable with them. They will learn more about the female body in terms of health, sex, pleasure, culture, and art. Though based on sound scientific and medical research, Read My Lips is accessible to the masses, so women and men who are curious about the clitoris, Brazilian waxing, labiaplasty, or whether the G-spot really exists, will find something of interest in these pages. Chapters focus on sex and the vulva/vagina which, in spite of the many interesting cultural and historical aspects of vulva and vagina lore, remains of central interest to many people - as it should, given that women's genitals, and how they work, especially in regard to sex, remain a mystery to so many well-intentioned lovers. In keeping with the overall theme of celebration and education, the authors take a sex-positive, pleasure-focused perspective on women's genitals, pointing out the parts that can help women to enjoy sex and feel more comfortable in their own bodies. Tips on technique will also be shared alongside information on vaginal health.[/font][/size][/color] [/quote]\r\n\r\n[img]http://s29.postimg.org/maokz8c9z/LRrsf_Znw85.gif[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:367dd10f7be9f58164ddfc9cc466630fe8d69601","amp;dn":"Read+My+Lips+A+Complete+Guide+to+the+Vagina+and+Vulva+--+SSEC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"367dd10f7be9f58164ddfc9cc466630fe8d69601","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,125,209,15,123,233,245,129,100,221,252,156,196,102,99,15,232,214,150,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
