Milwaukee filmmaker Mark Borchardt feverishly works to finish his independent horror film Coven, but with poor financing and lack of planning finds it nearly impossible to complete. The documentary follows Borchardt's filmmaking process from script to screen, and is interspersed with footage from both developing projects. American Movie was produced by Sarah Price, edited by Jun Diaz and Barry Poltermann and directed by Chris Smith.\n\nMore information: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.americanmovie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.americanmovie.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Movie&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Movie&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nEnjoy and, if possible, please keep seeding until you have uploaded at least as much as you have downloaded!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8413be6e36e4a4d0ea4da90699a6276880cb2275","amp;dn":"American+Movie+%281999%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8413be6e36e4a4d0ea4da90699a6276880cb2275","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,19,190,110,54,228,164,208,234,77,169,6,153,166,39,104,128,203,34,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
