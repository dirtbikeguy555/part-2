Mount it in a virtual machine using VirtualBox or VMware Player and install! Or, your own machine...if you dare...\n\nNote you probably won't be able to get internet access using it, as it is configured to connect to Kwangmyong which is NK's private intranet.\n\nYou can change the language to English by modifying the relevant languages section in\n\n/etc/sysconfig/i18n\n\nand\n\n/usr/share/config/kdeglobals\n\nfrom ko_KP to en_US. Note the dear leader doesn't let you have sudo privileges to alter such files (even though according to system preferences you're a system 'administrator') - so I booted a live CD of another Linux distro and chroot'ed in to modify them. May as well add yourself to the sudoers file while you're at it.\n\nThere's some dodgy processes in the background and a disk &quot;encrypter&quot; (good one Kim - hey, at least the NSA won't have access!)\n\nInterestingly, according to Will Scott (who taught computer science in North Korea) - most North Koreans don't use Red Star, but rather Windows XP and occasionally 7. Red Star seems to be reserved for enterprise applications. Nonetheless, good fun for poking around with!\n\nCredit to slipstream / raylee.
