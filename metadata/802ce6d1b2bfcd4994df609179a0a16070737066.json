Superficially stereotypical, she is dressed neatly in tweed and is frequently seen knitting or pulling weeds in her garden. Miss Marple sometimes comes across as confused or &quot;fluffy&quot;, but when it comes to solving mysteries, she has a sharp logical mind, and an almost unmatched understanding of human nature with all its weaknesses, strengths, quirks and foibles. In the detective story tradition, she often embarrasses the local &quot;professional&quot; police by solving mysteries that have them stumped.\n\n01 - The Murder at the Vicarage (1930)\n02 - The Body in the Library (1942)\n03 - The Moving Finger (1943)\n04 - A Murder is Announced (1950)\n05 - They Do It with Mirrors, or Murder with Mirrors (1952)\n06 - A Pocket Full of Rye (1953)\n07 - 4.50 from Paddington, or What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw!
