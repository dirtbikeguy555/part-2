YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll play as one of four new survivors armed with a wide and devastating array of classic and upgraded weapons. In addition to firearms, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll also get a chance to take out some aggression on infected with a variety of carnage-creating melee weapons, from chainsaws to axes and even the deadly frying pan. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be putting these weapons to the test against (or playing as in Versus) three horrific and formidable new Special Infected. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll also encounter five new ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œuncommonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ common infected, including the terrifying Mudmen. Helping to take L4DÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s frantic, action-packed gameplay to the next level is AI Director 2.0. This improved Director has the ability to procedurally change the weather youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll fight through and the pathways youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll take, in addition to tailoring the enemy population, effects, and sounds to match your performance. L4D2 promises a satisfying and uniquely challenging experience every time the game is played, custom-fitted to your style of play.\n\n\n\n\nGame: left For Dead 2\nPlatform: XBOX 360\nFormat: ISO\nLanguage: English\n\n\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nG U R U F U E L\n           .com\n\nHARDWARE.
