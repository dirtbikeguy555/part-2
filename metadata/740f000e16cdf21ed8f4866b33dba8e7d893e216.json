Nunez. \n\n2010\nENGLISH\nISBN: 019534071X \n320 pages \nCHM \n2.75 MB\n\n Does the brain create the mind, or is some external entity involved? In addressing this &quot;hard problem&quot; of consciousness, we face a central human challenge: what do we really know and how do we know it? Tentative answers in this book follow from a synthesis of profound ideas, borrowed from philosophy, religion, politics, economics, neuroscience, physics, mathematics, and cosmology, the knowledge structures supporting our meager grasps of reality. This search for new links in the web of human knowledge extends in many directions: the &quot;shadows&quot; of our thought processes revealed by brain imagining, brains treated as complex adaptive systems that reveal fractal-like behavior in the brain's nested hierarchy, resonant interactions facilitating functional connections in brain tissue, probability and entropy as measures of human ignorance, fundamental limits on human knowledge, and the central role played by information in both brains and physical systems. In Brain, Mind, and the Structure of Reality, Paul Nunez discusses the possibility of deep connections between relativity, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and consciousness: all entities involved with fundamental information barriers. Dr. Nunez elaborates on possible new links in this nested web of human knowledge that may tell us something new about the nature and origins of consciousness. In the end, does the brain create the mind? Or is the Mind already out there? You decide. By incorporating examples from disciplines not traditionally used by neuroscientists, he succeeds in demonstrating how complex systems can be formed from the interactions of many simpler parts.\n --Journal of the American Medical Association &quot;Brain, Mind and the Structure of Reality is a worthwhile read for scientists as well as nonscientists interested in the origins of consciousness. The author presents many thought-provoking observations and hypotheses and in many cases demonstrates his ability to present complex physical and mathematical phenomena in a way that will be readily understood by readers without substantial training in either discipline.&quot; --JAMA Enjoy this great book! \nbrain mind and the structure,\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515ngarrGwL._SS500_.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/515ngarrGwL._SS500_.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCareers in Child Care\n\n McGraw-Hill; 3 edition \nMarjorie Eberts ,Margaret Gisler\n2007 \nENGLISH\nISBN-10: 0071482113 \n242 pages \nPDF \n1.18 MB\n\n Careers in child care are tremendously rewarding; it is also a field with diverse opportunities.

The core of the book deals with the long-term trends in areas such as health, diet and nutrition, wealth and income, poor Americans, housing, transportation and communications, education, safety, environmental protection, social and cultural indicators, and freedom and democracy. The authors' thesis is that there has been more material progress in the U.S. in the twentieth century than in the entire world in all previous centuries combined. Yet in the book's foreword Simon's widow contends that the killing of millions of people around the world because of Nazism, Stalinism, and Maoism must also be factored into any analysis of that century. The astounding progress in the U.S. will hopefully be replicated in the twenty-first century and extended to other nations throughout the world. \n Mary Whaley\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51h7tefl5CL._SS500_.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51h7tefl5CL._SS500_.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nScience and Myth: What We Are Never Told \n\nSOPHIA PERENNIS\nWolfgang Smith\n2010 \nENGLISH\nISBN: 1597310972, 1597310980 \n193 pages \nPDF \n3.41 MB \n\n In Science and Myth the author shows, in the first place, that science too has its mythology, unrecognized and unacknowledged though the fact be. These scientistic myths, however, turn out to constitute what he terms anti-myths: &quot;a kind that would banish all others, and in so doing, undermine not only religion and morality, but indeed all culture in its higher modes.&quot; What invalidates the contemporary &quot;scientific&quot; world-view and renders it &quot;mythical&quot; in the pejorative sense, he goes on to contend, proves finally to be the underlying hypothesis that human perception terminates, not in an external object, but in a subjective phantasm. Not only does the author maintain cogently that visual perception, in particular, does penetrate to the external world, but basing himself on traditional sources-fromVedic to Biblical-he shows that sight as such opens in principle to a veritable gnosis: a &quot;seeing of the Real.&quot;\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41u4Zj%2BgU-L._SS500_.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41u4Zj%2BgU-L._SS500_.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSelf-Therapy for the Stutterer \n\n Stuttering Foundation of America \nMalcolm Fraser, L.H.D.\n2010\nENGLISH\nISBN-10: 0933388454 \n196 pages \nPDF \n1.17 MB\n\n Outlines a self-therapy program which describes what the person who stutters can and should do to tackle the problem and control stuttering.
