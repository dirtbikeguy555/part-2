But unlike the traditional narrative, a story already shaped by the knowledge of what Joan would become and told in hindsight, Castorâ€™s Joan of Arc: A History takes us back to fifteenth century France and tells the story forwards. Instead of an icon, she gives us a living, breathing woman confronting the challenges of faith and doubt, a roaring girl who, in fighting the English, was also taking sides in a bloody civil war. We meet this extraordinary girl amid the tumultuous events of her extraordinary world where no one â€” not Joan herself, nor the people around her â€” princes, bishops, soldiers, or peasants â€” knew what would happen next.\r\n\r\nAdding complexity, depth, and fresh insight into Joanâ€™s life, and placing her actions in the context of the larger political and religious conflicts of fifteenth century France, Joan of Arc: A History is history at its finest and a surprising new portrait of this remarkable woman","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fbdaffacdd4f0fbf75350549301bf825e1773a8","amp;dn":"Joan+of+Arc%3A+A+History","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fbdaffacdd4f0fbf75350549301bf825e1773a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,189,175,250,205,212,240,251,247,83,80,84,147,1,191,130,94,23,115,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
