Do well in high school, thereby receiving a great college scholarship. Now that sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s finally graduated, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s time for her to find a gorgeous loft apartment and land her dream job at the cityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s best publishing house. But when Jessica Bard, RydenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s college nemesis steals her perfect job, Ryden is forced to move back to her childhood home.
