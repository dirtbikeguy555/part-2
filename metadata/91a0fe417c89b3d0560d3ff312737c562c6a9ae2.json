In this final volume, Runciman examines the revival of the Frankish kingdom at the time of the Third Crusade until its collapse a century later. The interwoven themes of the book include: Christiandom, the replacement of the cultured Ayubites by the less sympathetic Mameluks as leader of the Moslem world, and the coming of the Mongols. He includes a chapter on architecture and the arts, and an epilogue on the last manifestations of the Crusading spirit","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91a0fe417c89b3d0560d3ff312737c562c6a9ae2","amp;dn":"A+History+of+the+Crusades%3A+Volume+3+-+The+Kingdom+of+Acre","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91a0fe417c89b3d0560d3ff312737c562c6a9ae2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,160,254,65,124,137,179,208,86,13,63,243,18,115,124,86,44,106,154,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
