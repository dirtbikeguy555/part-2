Kaufman\nNarrated by: Raun K. Kaufman\nLength: 8 hrs and 15 mins\nFormat: Unabridged\nRelease Date:07-15-14\n\nAs a boy, Raun Kaufman was diagnosed by multiple experts as severely autistic, with an IQ below 30, and destined to spend his life in an institution. Years later, Raun graduated with a degree in biomedical ethics from Brown University and has become a passionate and articulate autism expert and educator with no trace of his former condition. Thanks to the Son-Rise Program, a revolutionary method created by his parents, Raun experienced a full recovery from autism. In Autism Breakthrough, Raun presents the ground-breaking principles behind the program that helped him and thousands of other families with special children. Parents and educators learn how to enable their children to create meaningful, caring relationships, vastly expand their communications, and to participate successfully in the world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:893a1175325890023c856917c104321dae5cc906","amp;dn":"Autism+Breakthrough+-+Raun+K.+Kaufman+-+Audiobook+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"893a1175325890023c856917c104321dae5cc906","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,58,17,117,50,88,144,2,60,133,105,23,193,4,50,29,174,92,201,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
