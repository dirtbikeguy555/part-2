Salvatore, Ed Greenwood, the creator of the Forgotten RealmsÃ‚Â®, further chronicles the exploits of Elminster as he fights for the future of FaerÃƒÂ»n.\n \nChaos grips FaerÃƒÂ»n as vainglory, prophecy, and ancient forces comingle in the shadows cast by war.  Agents of the Shadovar lurk in the corners of Candlekeep in search of the arcane secrets that will power their war machine toward Myth Drannor. Gods and their Chosen run amok, all in a gambit to seize power. And a threat foretold by an ancient seer stirs.\n \nAt the heart of it all, Mystra, the great Goddess of Magic, has withdrawn from the world. Without her protection, Elminster, her greatest champion, fears for the nascent Weave, the fabric of magic Mystra wields to bind FaerÃƒÂ»n. Will the Nightseer Shar, mistress of the great and fearsome Shadovar, seize the opportunity to blanket the world with her Shadow Weave?\n \nWith the help of Storm Silverhand and his protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ© Amarune, Elminster works frantically to strengthen the WeaveÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tethers and forestall what seems an inevitable reckoning. But other interests machinate for their own sinister ends.\n \nAs the Sundering draws nigh, Elminster and his heroic cohort must see the signs for what they are. The choice of worlds lies in the balance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab55b5c4c6b6502bb7237cb04fa470903c32be1b","amp;dn":"Ed+Greenwood+-+The+Herald+%28The+Sundering+VI%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab55b5c4c6b6502bb7237cb04fa470903c32be1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,85,181,196,198,182,80,43,183,35,124,176,79,164,112,144,60,50,190,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
