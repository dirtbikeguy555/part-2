His self-titled album opens with the unadorned guitar-and-vocal Ã¢â‚¬Å“Demon Host,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but adds increasingly more complex, yet still spare, production elements as the record progresses. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Until the NightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ features tinkling autoharp, garage rock organ, and a languid oriental melody, while Ã¢â‚¬Å“Trouble Comes KnockingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is driven by sleazy strip-club saxophone and a throbbing bass drum beat. Throughout, TIMBER TIMBRE sounds like the soundtrack to some great lost Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ60s B-movie, at once colorfully original and creepily unsettling.\nTrack Listing\n1: Demon Host\n2: Lay Down In The Tall Grass\n3: Until The Night Is Over\n4: Magic Arrow\n5: We'll Find Out\n6: I Get Low\n7: Trouble Comes Knocking\n8: No Bold Villain","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bbc14e55232848ade492c840a790a53969896fe1","amp;dn":"Timber+Timbre++-+Timber+Timbre+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bbc14e55232848ade492c840a790a53969896fe1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,193,78,85,35,40,72,173,228,146,200,64,167,144,165,57,105,137,111,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
