Police psychoanalyst Dr. Michael Glass is called for examining Tramell, and is intrigued by the seductive and manipulative woman. On the other hand , his friend Det. Roy Washburn is sure Tramell is guilty. Tramell asks Glass to treat her for her 'risk addiction' problem, and with each therapy session , Glass gets more and more suspicious about her intentions. As more and more murders are committed, including that of Glass's ex-wife, Glass becomes obsessed with proving Tramell's guilt even though the evidence is contradictory .[/size][/b]\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/ErhrCZH&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/ErhrCZH&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/GNLTewM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/GNLTewM&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/avsaQ2B&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/avsaQ2B&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/aIFislN&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/aIFislN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/Ks4ciBo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/Ks4ciBo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://someimage.com/czdJdOs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://someimage.com/czdJdOs&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nCast\n\n\n\n    Sharon Stone as Catherine Tramell\n    David Morrissey as Dr. Michael Glass\n    David Thewlis as Roy Washburn\n    Charlotte Rampling as Dr. Milena Gardosh\n    Heathcote Williams as Dr. Jakob Gerst\n    Hugh Dancy as Adam Towers\n    Indira Varma as Denise Glass\n    Anne Caillon as Laney Ward\n    Iain Robertson as Peter Ristedes\n    Stan Collymore as Kevin Franks\n    Kata DobÃƒÂ³ as Magda\n    Flora Montgomery as Michelle Broadwin\n    Jan Chappell as Angela\n\n\nMEDIA-INFO\n\nBox Office\n\n\nBudget:$70.000.000 (estimated)\nOpening Weekend:$448.743 (Mexico) (28 April 2006)\nGross:$1.533.491 (Mexico) (26 May 2006) \n\n\nDid You Know?\n\nTrivia\nRobert Downey Jr. was set to star but had to drop out when he was charged with drug possession.

Bruce Greenwood was set to star but dropped out because he hadn't been signed on yet and \n\nfeared the actors strike. Benjamin Bratt was banned by Sharon Stone for not being a good actor.\n\nGoofs\nAt the end of the movie, there is a scene where Dr. Glass is sitting in his wheelchair in the outdoor hallway of the Crazy House. \n\nCatherine walks up to him and she places her book on a table beside a chair.

However, Stone has reportedly been \n\nchampioning the film's production and, if greenlighted, said she would not be starring in the final installment to the trilogy but \n\nwould hope to instead be its director. \n\n\n\n*Title.....................:  Basic Instinct 2\n*Genre.....................:    Action | Adventure | Thriller\n*Encoded/Released By.......: tomcat12\n*Year/Language.............: 2006/English\n*Source....................: Blu-ray Remux\n*Type/Writing Library......: MPEG-4 AVC/ x264 core 133 r2334 rc=2pass \n*Conteiner.................: mp4\n*File size.................: 3.17 GiB\n*Overall Bit Rate..........: 3 978 Kbps\n*Video Bit Rate............: 3 602 Kbps\n*AUDiO:....................: AAC / 6CH / 384 Kbps\n*Resolution................: 1 920 x 800 pixels\n*FPS/AR....................: 23.976 fps/2.40:1\n*Runtime/sample...................: 1h 54mn/01min \n*SUBTiTLES srt:.................:  English,Arabic,Greek,Polish,\nPortuguese,Romanian.\n                 Menu \n\n00:00:00.000 : Driving Under the Influence \n00:08:04.901 : &quot;I'm Traumatized&quot; \n00:15:15.748 : The Evaluation \n00:19:40.221 : Chesslov \n00:28:33.128 : She's Back on the Street \n00:38:08.786 : No Comment \n00:43:50.253 : &quot;Got a Minute&quot; \n00:49:06.944 : Just Checking Your Policy \n00:56:39.062 : You Can Smell the Blood \n01:04:57.435 : Leaving Because of Me? \n01:11:40.796 : Mind's on Someone Else \n01:19:57.960 : Finding Adam \n01:27:03.260 : What if I Told You \n01:32:29.753 : Are You Feeling Alright? \n01:39:09.110 : Ich Reche Blut (I Smell Blood) \n01:43:20.194 : This Is the Real Interview.\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fc0f33d96bee2da0fbaf44def89bfd4fe2ad566","amp;dn":"Basic+Instinct+2+2006+1080p+BDRip+AAC+x264-tomcat12","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fc0f33d96bee2da0fbaf44def89bfd4fe2ad566","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,192,243,61,150,190,226,218,15,186,244,77,239,137,191,212,254,42,213,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
