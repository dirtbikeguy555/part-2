Sheâ€™s disturbed to discover the culprit is a raven, and tries to shoo it away. Which is when the killer strikes. \r\nDS Nathan Cody, still bearing the scars of an undercover mission that went horrifyingly wrong, is put on the case. But the police have no leads, except the body of the bird â€“ and the victimâ€™s missing eyes. \r\nAs flashbacks from his past begin to intrude, Cody realises he is battling not just a murderer, but his own inner demons too. \r\nAnd then the killer strikes again, and Cody realises the threat isnâ€™t to the people of Liverpool after all â€“ itâ€™s to the police. \r\nFollowing the success and acclaim of the Callum Doyle novels, A Tapping at My Door is the first instalment of David Jacksonâ€™s new Nathan Cody series. \r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f75c97ad32a0b1f6094242fed0376a7e02fb684","amp;dn":"A+Tapping+at+my+Door+-+David+Jackson+%5BEN+EPUB+MOBI+AZW3%5D+%5Bebook%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f75c97ad32a0b1f6094242fed0376a7e02fb684","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,117,201,122,211,42,11,31,96,148,36,47,237,3,118,167,224,47,182,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
