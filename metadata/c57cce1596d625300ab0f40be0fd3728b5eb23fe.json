The game represents a unique and unforgettable experience as it transports players in a weird town which crouches, ominous, in the far reaches of an ancient steppe. It was once a small drover settlement, huddled around a monstrous abattoirâ€”but something about the butchery it was near has changed it. It has developed an odd social structure over the course of several generations. It could have quietly continued along its weird way, but a sudden outbreak of an unknown and inevitably lethal disease has decimated the citizens. Prayers did not help. Science did not help. So, finally, they have turned to outsiders for help: three of them enter the town in hope of finding a cure orâ€”failing thatâ€”an explanation. The first outsider was a ruthless investigator, assigned by local authorities. The second is a far-sighted Ripper who has used his extraordinary abilities to gain a reputation as an ingenious surgeon, who has come to the town in search of his father's terrible heritage. The thirdâ€”and lastâ€”outsider is an eccentric girl rumored to have mystic healing abilities; she may become the town's salvation were it not for the constant fear that plagues her, the memory of the horrors of her recent past.\r\nOn the surface, Pathologic is a first person horror adventure game where you control one of three &quot;heroes.&quot; Dig deeper, however, and youâ€™ll find an experience that will affect your emotional and psychological state. In the world of Pathologic youâ€™ll find yourself in situations where morals and good deeds are meaningless in the face of raw despair and endless need. Talk to the denizens of the town and decide for yourself if you wish to ease someone elseâ€™s pain or save every bit of precious medicine to protect yourself from the invisible and inexorable plague. Become witness to the miasma of horror as the plague begins to overcome the town.\r\nNew Enhancements\r\nBrand New in-house English script: For the first time ever, the game has cast off the major issue that had previously disallowed international audiences from accessing it. \r\nBrand New Voice-overs\r\nNew content: A certain amount of text that had previously been cut from the international version of the game have now been restored \r\nUpdated textures and higher resolutions support. \r\nNew visual effects.\r\nNewly Included Fan-Made Polish translation thanks to the hard work and generosity of Jakub Derdziak &amp; Aldona Derdziak.\r\nAn indie cult classic.\r\n12 days in a plague-ridden town. Time is running, and mostly itâ€™s running out; numerous events unfold, whether youâ€™re there to witness them or not.\r\n70+ hours of real-time gameplay without grinding or repetitive quests. As time goes by, more and more things happen, inviting you to participate and change the course of events.\r\n3 playable characters with 3 unique storylines. The Bachelorâ€™s, the Haruspexâ€™s, and the Changelingâ€™s plots are interconnected, but every side of the trilemma is represented separately via unique events, quests, dialogues, and subplots.\r\nThe plot is critically acclaimed and often regarded as the high point of the game. Itâ€™s not just about the fate of the dying townâ€”itâ€™s about an ideological conflict, represented by a multitude of characters and factions, each with their own idea of what life, death, and miracles are.\r\nAn open-world game. While the plot is there to grab you, the town has no artificial boundaries: you are free to explore it from day one, carving out your own story.\r\nSurvival is tough. The dying town demands that you constantly keep an eye on your status, maintaining a full belly and decent immunity. That will require tough choices.\r\nCommunicate, barter, rob, or steal. There are many ways to acquire your bare necessities, each of them with its own benefits and drawbacks.\r\nThe atmosphere of bleakness and despair without cartoonish evil or bad guys. Playtime is overâ€”there will be no jump scares or simple solutions. You will have to do it the hard way.\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: XP or Later\r\nProcessor: AMD Athlon 64 2.3 GHz / Intel Pentium 2.2 GHz \r\nMemory: 2 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: Radeon HD 4890 1024MB / GeForce 210 512MB \r\nDirectX: Version 9.0 \r\nHard Drive: 2 GB available space","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c57cce1596d625300ab0f40be0fd3728b5eb23fe","amp;dn":"Pathologic+Classic+HD+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c57cce1596d625300ab0f40be0fd3728b5eb23fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,124,206,21,150,214,37,48,10,176,244,11,224,253,55,40,181,235,35,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
