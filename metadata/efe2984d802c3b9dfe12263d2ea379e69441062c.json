Even while the group recorded several albums for IRS, Orbit remained in the studio to learn the ropes\nand began producing and remixing for artists including Sting, Madonna, Prince, the Human League, Erasure, and Belinda Carlisle.\n\nOrbit concurrently recorded his own material, and released his first solo album, Orbit, in 1987. That same year, he inaugurated\nthe ambient project Strange Cargo, which released follow-up albums in 1990 and 1993. Also during the late '80s, Orbit latched\nonto the acid house explosion in England and founded one of the scene's most notable labels, Guerilla Records.\n\nOrbit's own Bassomatic recorded for Guerilla alongside British progressive acts Spooky and React 2 Rhythm plus excellent Chicago\nproducers Felix da Housecat and DJ Pierre. Through Virgin, Bassomatic also released an album, Set the Controls for the Heart of the Bass.\n\nThough his release schedule slowed slightly during the '90s, William Orbit continued producing and remixing at a furious pace.\nHe also founded a new label, N-Gram Recordings, and prepared to release the classical crossover work Pieces in a Modern Style.\nThe album, which featured electronic interpretations of classical pieces, drew angry protests from composers Arvo PÃƒÂ¤rt and\nHenryk GÃƒÂ³recki, and they helped block the album's release.\n\nIn 1998, after 15 years of behind the scenes post-production, Orbit's name hit the mainstream thanks to his helming the Madonna\ncomeback album Ray of Light (Orbit not only produced the entire LP, but co-wrote many of the tracks). The album won Grammy\nawards for Best Pop Album and Best Dance Recording, and its success led to a host of remixing and production work,\nincluding Blur's 1999 album, 13.\n\nIn 2000, Orbit finally released Pieces in a Modern Style, and the album became an unexpected hit thanks to Ferry Corsten's\ntrance remix of Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings. In 2006 he returned with Hello Waveforms on the Sanctuary label.\nFinley Quaye appeared on the album along with former Torch Song/Strange Cargo vocalist Laurie Mayer.\nMy Oracle Lives Uptown followed in 2009 on the Kobalt label, and one year later he released Pieces in a Modern Style 2,\nanother edition of classical material, including Orbit's version of &quot;Swan Lake.&quot;\n\n\nTrack List\n\nThe 80's\n\n01.
