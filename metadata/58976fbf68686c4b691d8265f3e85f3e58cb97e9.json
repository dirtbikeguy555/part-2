Serving as the third single on April 8, 2012 through Interscope Records, it also appeared on the EP, Lana Del Rey (2011), the re-release of her second album, Born to Die - The Paradise Edition (2012), and the second disc of the compilation album, Now That's What I Call Chill!.[2] Produced by Emile Haynie, the song was written by Del Rey, Haynie, and Dan Heath. As a downtempo pop ballad with alternative hip hop influences, it was featured in the television series Ringer, along with &quot;Video Games&quot;, propelling Del Rey into the mainstream. A controversial performance of the song on SNL placed Del Rey under scrutiny and polarized opinion. Charting across Europe and Asia, &quot;Blue Jeans&quot; reached the top ten in Belgium, Poland, and Israel. Two music videos were created for the song. The first was self-produced. The second was shot and directed by Yoann Lemoine, featuring film noir elements and a crocodile. In the video, Del Rey's fictional boyfriend is played by Bradley Soileau, husband of pop singer, Porcelain Black.\n\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFile size                                : 10.2 MiB\nDuration                                 : 4mn 16s\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Variable\nOverall bit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nAlbum                                    : Born To Die The Paradise Edition\nTrack name                               : Blue Jeans (Full Video Version)\nPerformer                                : Lana Del Rey\nGenre                                    : Indie Pop\nRecorded date                            : 2012\nWriting library                          : LAME3.98.4\nCover                                    : Yes\nCover type                               : Cover (front)\nCover MIME                               : image/jpg\nmajor_brand                              : mp42\nminor_version                            : 0\ncompatible_brands                        : isommp42\n\nAudio\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nDuration                                 : 4mn 16s\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 9.80 MiB (96%)\nWriting library                          : LAME3.98.4\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58976fbf68686c4b691d8265f3e85f3e58cb97e9","amp;dn":"Lana+Del+Rey+-+Blue+Jeans+%28Full+Video+Version%29+MP3+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58976fbf68686c4b691d8265f3e85f3e58cb97e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,151,111,191,104,104,108,75,105,29,130,101,243,232,95,62,88,203,151,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
