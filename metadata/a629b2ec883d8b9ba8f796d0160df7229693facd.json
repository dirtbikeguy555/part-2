Its primary aim is to show how the planets and their satellites, comets, meteors, interplanetary dust, solar radiation and cosmic rays continually interact, sometimes violently, and it reflects humanity's progress in exploring and interpreting this history. The book is intended for a general readership at a time when human and robotic exploration of space is often in the news and should also appeal to students at all levels. It covers the essentials but refers to a large literature which can be accessed via the internet","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a629b2ec883d8b9ba8f796d0160df7229693facd","amp;dn":"A+History+of+the+Solar+System+%28Claudio+Vita-Finzi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a629b2ec883d8b9ba8f796d0160df7229693facd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,41,178,236,136,61,139,155,168,247,150,208,22,13,247,34,150,147,250,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
