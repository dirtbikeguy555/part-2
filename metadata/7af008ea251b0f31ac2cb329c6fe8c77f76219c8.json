Both the game and the movie are based on J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the fourth novel in the Harry Potter series.\nThe game follows the three main characters of the film Ã¢â‚¬â€ namely Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley Ã¢â‚¬â€ and there is an entirely new spell-casting system that allows for collaborative spells. The characters themselves more closely resemble their film counterparts than in previous games. It also has higher-quality graphics than the previous Harry Potter video games. However, the game play in the fourth video game is much more action-oriented, which is a change from the previous games.\nIn addition, players can play the game with friends, and can combine their magic and spells to make them more powerful. Players can also capture moving beans using Accio and increase their power with collectors, creature, and character, cards.\nThere is no RPG iteration of the game, unlike with previous titles. In addition, it was pointed out that unlike the previous installments, there was not much room to &quot;run around&quot; such as in the previous games where you were allowed to move freely within the castle and on the grounds.\nThe game is divided into several non-consecutive levels, some of which are locked at the beginning of the game until the player collects enough Triwizard Shields to unlock it.\nIt is noted as the last Harry Potter game released on GameCube and Xbox, its also the first Harry Potter Game to get an E10+ Rating in North America.\n\nHarry Potter is unexpectedly chosen as a fourth contender for the title of Triwizard Tournament champion in his fourth year at Hogwarts. Over the course of the school year, he must learn the spells and tricks necessary for him to be able to get through three difficult tasks and, ultimately, escape the clutches of infamous evil wizard Lord Voldemort.\n\nCharacters\nThe following actors have contributed their voices to the game for their characters:\n\nDaniel Larner Ã¢â‚¬â€œ voice of Harry Potter (likeness provided by Daniel Radcliffe)\nHarper Marshall Ã¢â‚¬â€œ voice of Hermione Granger (likeness provided by Emma Watson)\nGregg Chillin - voice of Ron Weasley (likeness provided by Rupert Grint)\nLewis Macleod Ã¢â‚¬â€œ voice of Albus Dumbledore (likeness provided by Michael Gambon)\nStanley Townsend Ã¢â‚¬â€œ voice of Alastor &quot;Mad-Eye&quot; Moody (likeness provided by Brendan Gleeson)\nRalph Fiennes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Lord Voldemort\nTom Goodman-Hill Ã¢â‚¬â€œ voice of Peter Pettigrew (likeness provided by Timothy Spall)\nBoris Mitkova Ã¢â‚¬â€œ voice of Viktor Krum (likeness provided by Stanislav Ianevski)\nClaudia Renton Ã¢â‚¬â€œ voice of Fleur Delacour (likeness provided by ClÃƒÂ©mence PoÃƒÂ©sy)\n\nInstall Notes :-\n1.
