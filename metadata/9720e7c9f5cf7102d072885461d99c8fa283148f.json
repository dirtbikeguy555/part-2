Maybe itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a snow-capped mountain, an urban cityscape or a sunset over the ocean. Whatever it is, you are so fascinated by its grandeur, nuances and vibrance. Without diverting your gaze, you raise your camera and press the shutter so you can hang onto this moment forever. But then ... your excitement fades as you realize the digital version pales in comparison to the real thing. If only there was a way to make the image fully reflect your photographic vision in brilliant contrast, depth, and color. \n\nWatch your images come to life with dramatic contrast, incredible detail and vivid color.\n\nUnlike our eyes, a camera lens can't compensate for all the tonal values we see right in front of us. If you shoot something bright, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll lose all the details in the shadows, if you shoot something dark, the highlights will be blown out. You can try to correct contrast, details, and vibrancy yourself, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s difficult to make images pop like you want. Thankfully, with Topaz Adjust you can give your images the soul and character you envisioned in the field. \n\nNew features include an updated user interface along with an added grid view mode.\n\nSystem Requirements\n\n- Intel-based Macs with OS 10.6, 10.7 or 10.8 (Topaz is NOT compatible with PowerPC processors - like G4 or G5.)\n- 4 GB RAM minimum - preferably more\n- Adobe Photoshop CS4-CS6-CC-CC 2014 (32-bit and 64-bit), Adobe Photoshop Elements 6-11***.\n- Apple Aperture 2 and 3, Lightroom 2-5, and iPhoto via Topaz Fusion Express\n\nLanguage: English\n\nHomepage :  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.topazlabs.com/adjust&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.topazlabs.com/adjust&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9720e7c9f5cf7102d072885461d99c8fa283148f","amp;dn":"Topaz+Adjust+5.1.0+%28MAC%29+plugin+photoshop+%5BChingLiu%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9720e7c9f5cf7102d072885461d99c8fa283148f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,32,231,201,245,207,113,2,208,114,136,84,97,217,156,143,162,131,20,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
