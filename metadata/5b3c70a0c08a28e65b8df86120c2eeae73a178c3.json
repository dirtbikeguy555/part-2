I activated mine with a legit key and it works.\nThe game is protected by Aspyrs own registration system called &quot;Software Passport&quot;,\nbut this is way easier to [k] than secuROM - it already happened before with CoD4\nand other games from Aspyr. So please, don't ask for serials or cracks right now,\nbecause there are NONE. But feel free to download this huge game of 12GB so you\nhave it ready to play once medicine comes out by a release group (it will happen)\n\nThe day a working patch is released, this post will be edited so you won't miss it.\n\n*** Crack is OUT : http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5404355\n\nAlso, feel free to buy the game if you can't wait (thats the spirit anyway :D)\n\nAlso, please be aware of this games pretty steep (for a Mac at least) hardware requirements:\n\nMinimum System Requirements:\n\nOperating System: 10.5.8 (Leopard), 10.6.2 (Snow Leopard)\nProcessor: Intel Core 2 Duo (Dual-Core)\nCPU Speed: 2.4 GHz\nMemory: 2 GB RAM\nHard Disk Space: 25 GB + 1 GB Swap File\nVideo Card (ATI): Radeon HD2600, (NVidia): Geforce 8600\nVideo Memory (VRam): 256 MB\nPeripherals: Macintosh mouse and keyboard or Microsoft Xbox 360 Wired Controller \n\nRecommended System Requirements\nCPU Speed: 2.6 GHz Intel Quad-Core\nVideo Card: Geforce 8800\nVideo RAM: 512 MB\n\nLucasArts and the LucasArts logo are registered trademarks of Lucasfilm Ltd.
