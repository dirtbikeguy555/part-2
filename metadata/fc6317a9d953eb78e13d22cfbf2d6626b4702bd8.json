His ambition puts him at odds with local chieftain Earl Haraldson (Gabriel Byrne), who insists on sending his raiders to the impoverished east rather than the uncharted west. When Ragnar teams up with his boat builder friend Floki (Gustaf Skarsgard) to craft a new generation of intrepid ships capable of conquering the rough northern seas, the stage is set for conflict.\r\n\r\nBut for all its warfare and bloodshed, Vikings is also a story of family and brotherhood, capturing the love and affection between Ragnar and his wife, Lagertha (Katheryn Winnick), a respected warrior in her own right. It is the tale of Ragnarâ€™s brother Rollo (Clive Standen), a fierce fighter who simmers with jealously; of Earl Haraldsonâ€™s wife Siggy (Jessalyn Gilsig), a dutiful beauty who may be less than loyal; and of the monk Athelstan (George Blagden), whose Christian morals clash with the Vikingsâ€™ pagan society. As ambition and innovation rattle a civilization, these characters will be put to the testâ€”and their way of life will never be the same again.\r\n\r\nVikings was created and written by Michael Hirst (Elizabeth, The Tudors).\r\n\r\n-Travis Fimmel as legendary Viking Ragnar Lothbrok. Originally a farmer, Ragnar claims to be a descendant of the god Odin, and he manages to rise to become a respected Earl of his home settlement Kattegat, as well as a feared warrior, a famed raider of undiscovered lands, and, finally, King of Denmark.\r\n-Katheryn Winnick as Lagertha, Ragnar's first wife; a shieldmaiden. Following the separation of her and Ragnar, Lagertha rises to become Earl of Hedeby in her own right, going by the name Earl Ingstad.\r\n-Clive Standen as Rollo, Ragnar's brother. Although a ruthless and skilled warrior, having spent his life in the shadow of his brother makes Rollo's feelings towards Ragnar constantly changing from loyal love and admiration, to hateful jealousy. The character is based on the great-great-great-grandfather of William the Conqueror.\r\n-Jessalyn Gilsig as Siggy, Earl Haraldson's wife, and later love-interest of Rollo. She possesses a strategic mind and a tireless urge to retain (or regain) her power and influence.\r\n-Gustaf SkarsgÃ¥rd as Floki, a gifted, albeit eccentric, shipbuilder and friend of Ragnar. Acknowledging his peculiar character traits, Floki considers himself a descendant of the trickster god Loki.\r\n\r\n-George Blagden as Athelstan, an Anglo-Saxon monk originally serving at the monastery of Lindisfarne in Northumbria. Captured by Ragnar on his first raid in England, Athelstan is torn between the customs of the Christian England and the pagan ways of Scandinavia.\r\n-Alexander Ludwig as Bjorn Ironside, Ragnar and Lagertha's son, given his epithet by his father, following his first battle with the Saxons (Seasons 2 and 3).\r\n-Nathan O'Toole as young Bjorn.
