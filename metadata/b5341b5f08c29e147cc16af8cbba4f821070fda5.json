It underlies a significant portion of modern synthetic chemistry and is integral to a molecular view of biological chemistry. The Wiley Series on Reactive Intermediates in Chemistry and Biology investigates reactive intermediates from the broadest possible range of disciplines. The contributions in each volume offer readers fresh insights into the latest findings, emerging applications, and ongoing research in the field from a diverse perspective. Topics may span theoretical approaches for predicting reactivity, physical methods of analysis, strategies for generating intermediates, utility for chemical synthesis, applications in biochemistry and medicine, impact on the environmental, occurrence in biology, and more. Readers should feel equally reassured by reviews in their specialty, inspired by helpful updates in allied areas and intrigued by topics not yet familiar","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5341b5f08c29e147cc16af8cbba4f821070fda5","amp;dn":"Wiley+Series+of+Reactive+Intermediates+in+Chemistry+and+Biology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5341b5f08c29e147cc16af8cbba4f821070fda5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,52,27,95,8,194,158,20,124,193,106,248,203,186,79,130,16,112,253,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
