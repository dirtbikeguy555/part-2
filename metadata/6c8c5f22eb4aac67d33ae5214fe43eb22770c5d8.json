Longing to help her and her family, he sells everything he can, but his kindness leads him only into more desperate poverty, and ultimately into debauchery. As a typical &quot;man of the underground&quot;, he serves as the embodiment of the belief that happiness can only be achieved with riches.\nThis work is remarkable for its vivid characterizations, especially of Dievushkin, the clerk, solely by means of his letters to the young girl and her answers to him.\n\n\nMP3 CD [Unabridged]\n\nPublisher: Blackstone Audiobooks; MP3 Una edition (February 1, 2004)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 078618616X\nISBN-13: 978-0786186167\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Thread-Promising-ebooks-Audio-Books-Torrents-by-The-Abee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Thread-Promising-ebooks-Audio-Books-Torrents-by-The-Abee&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n  SEED PLEASE , LET OTHERS GET IT TOO. \n `~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`\n\n\n                                                     :)__Abee","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c8c5f22eb4aac67d33ae5214fe43eb22770c5d8","amp;dn":"%28Classics%29+Poor+People+%5B64%5D+by+Fyodor+Dostoyevsky+ABEE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c8c5f22eb4aac67d33ae5214fe43eb22770c5d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,140,95,34,235,74,172,103,211,58,229,33,79,228,62,178,39,112,197,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
