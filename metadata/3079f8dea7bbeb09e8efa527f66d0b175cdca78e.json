As with any masterwork, it is something one will have to pursue. For those that seek it out at the proper time, 'Baraka' can act as a milestone of revelation. What the viewer takes from this film will solely be determined by the life experience they bring to it. 'Baraka' is unique in that it actually requires a commitment of time and concentration. This is a film that communicates its message without utilizing standard film language. Those that try to make the images conform to the conventional notions of Hollywood story telling are likely to give up in frustration. For a film with no plot,characters or dialog, it communicates an astonishing number of profound themes. Those who are familiar with National Geographic or the works of David Attenbourough will have little trouble in identifying the fascinating locals and tribes, but be forewarned: there are reasons that there are no subtitles or text on screen. Personal discovery is at the heart of the filmmaker's intentions. The ambient soundtrack by Michael Stearns weaves the images together on a separate plain, producing a hypnotic pathway for the images to flow. Once you allow yourself to be pulled along by this current of sound the images will link themselves together and the true revelations hidden within 'Baraka' will make themselves apparent. You may find as I did that your subconscious will be at work on 'Baraka' for many weeks after the experience, unlocking doors to a greater understanding.\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n---------------\nContainer...........: Matroska\nVideo Encoder.......: x264\nVideo Aspect Ratio..: 2.19:1 (1920x876)\nAudio Codec.........: DTS\nAudio BitRate.......: 1536 kbit/sec\nAudio Channels......: 5.1 channels\nSubtitles...........: English\nSource..............: Blu-Ray\nFile Size...........: 6.24 GB (avg bitrate of 7.2 Mbit)\nDXVA compliant......: Yes\n\n\n\n\nPlease look into the soundtrack as well:\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6057454/Baraka_-_Soundtrack_%28Michael_Stearns%29_%281993%29_%5BFLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6057454/Baraka_-_Soundtrack_%28Michael_Stearns%29_%281993%29_%5BFLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3079f8dea7bbeb09e8efa527f66d0b175cdca78e","amp;dn":"Baraka.1992.1080p.BluRay.x264-EuReKA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3079f8dea7bbeb09e8efa527f66d0b175cdca78e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,121,248,222,167,187,235,9,232,239,165,39,246,109,11,23,92,220,167,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
