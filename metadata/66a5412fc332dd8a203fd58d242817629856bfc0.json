The first sequence sets out the dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©cor, after a prologue where we hear that girls are partial to aggressive boys ... However, the protagonists are fragile creatures who discover their amorous attraction via a simple exchange of looks ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a furtive moment which the camera captures on the fly. Awkward and sensitive, these two youths, at the border between childhood and adolescence, give themselves an aura of freedom by going to discos, cigarettes between their lips. Happily, their ingenuousness does not lead to anything too terrible; exposed to the mocking gaze of adults, they manage to preserve the delicacy of their feelings and the justice of their attitudes.\n\nThe filmmaker observes his pre-adolescents like creatures still in a state of innocence, before maturity catches up and leads them to the mediocrity of adults. PÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤r, at one point humiliated by a bigger lad who repeatedly slaps him, takes refuge in solitude, and then gives in once more to the attraction he feels for Annika ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a very young girl who wears her miniskirt with unforced impudence. Andersson captures the furtive gestures that express love, such as when the boy walks, pushing his motorbike, while the girl follows him, her hand delicately laid on the back saddle.&quot;\n\nGreat quality from a DVD source. Also with directory commentary. This film set a precedent in authenticity. As only a Swede could, Andersson captures young love with the camera in lingering shots against a background of social critique of the older generation. Absolutely fucking brilliant film.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66a5412fc332dd8a203fd58d242817629856bfc0","amp;dn":"En+k%C3%83%C2%A4rlekshistoria+a.k.a+A+Swedish+Love+Story+%28Andersson%2C+1970%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66a5412fc332dd8a203fd58d242817629856bfc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,165,65,47,195,50,221,138,32,63,213,141,36,40,23,98,152,86,191,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
