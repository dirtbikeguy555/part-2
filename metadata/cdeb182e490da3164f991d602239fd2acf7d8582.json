The Harrow &amp; The Harvest,\n&quot;is a new Southern sound,&quot; writes Colin Meloy of The\nDecemberists, &quot;with the sort of songs you wouldn't be\nsurprised to hear issuing from some verdant, wooded hollow\nin Appalachia; Songs you'd expect to hear hollered from an\nAsheville grange hall, all too late in the evening. Songs\nwith the wry humour of the back porch. Listen to this\nrecord with the lights low. Listen to it on an old radio,\ncradled next to your ear.&quot;. Welch and Rawlings met at\nBerklee College of Music in Boston. Together, they moved\nto Nashville, TN, where most of their work together has\nbeen produced. Since then, they have influenced and\ninspired new generations of country and folk singers,\nsongwriters and players. They have earned the slavish\nadmiration of many of the most lauded and loved voices of\nthe Americana milieu, and had their songs recorded by the\nlikes of Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris, and Solomon Burke.\n\nGroup E-Mail:\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;9de9fcf6e8f0fcefeef0f2f3f6f8e4ddfaf0fcf4f1b3fef2f0&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nEnjoy The Music!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdeb182e490da3164f991d602239fd2acf7d8582","amp;dn":"Gillian+Welch-The+Harrow+And+The+Harvest-2011-TAKU","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdeb182e490da3164f991d602239fd2acf7d8582","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,235,24,46,73,13,163,22,79,153,29,96,34,57,253,42,207,125,133,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
