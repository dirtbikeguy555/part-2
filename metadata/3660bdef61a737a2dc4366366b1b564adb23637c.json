In essence, the building structure or some element of it is the system.There are no separate collectors, storage units or mechanical equipment. Passive systems are simple in concept and use, have few moving parts and are buUt using common Construction materials. The most striking difference between passive and active systems is that one operates on the energy available in its immediate environment and the other imports energy to make the system work.\n\nThis book Contains all of the information necessary, to successful design an effective pasive solar heated buildng. It is:\n\n- A Primer: in the fundamental concepts of solar energy, heat theory and thermal comfort.\n- A Source Book: with descriptions, photographs, illustrations and performance data of many passive solar-hÃƒÂ©ated buildings.\n- A Workbook: containing a step-By-step process for designing and sizing passive solar heating systems; methods for calculating building heat loss, heat gain, system performance anda cost effectiveness; and sun charts and graphic tools for desigrting shading devices, determining the extent of solarobstructions and calculating solar radiation values.\n\nAbout the Author\nEdward Mazrta is an architect, a member of the American Institute of Architects,and president of Edwarta Mazria and Associates Inc., in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The author of many solar publications, he has.taught courses on architectural design in solar energy and has conducted many passive solar workshops throughout the country for architects, builders and owner-builders.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s15.postimg.org/nbnmiditn/The_Passive_Solar_Energy_Book.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s15.postimg.org/nbnmiditn/The_Passive_Solar_Energy_Book.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3660bdef61a737a2dc4366366b1b564adb23637c","amp;dn":"The+Passive+Solar+Energy+Book+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3660bdef61a737a2dc4366366b1b564adb23637c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,96,189,239,97,167,55,162,220,67,102,54,107,27,86,74,219,35,99,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
