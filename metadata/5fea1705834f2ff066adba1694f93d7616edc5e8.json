To rid all realms of Shinnok's menace I waged a war that plunged the earth into centuries of darkness and banished Shinnok to a place called the Netherealm. Now after Shao Kahn's defeat at the hands of the earth warriors, Shinnok has managed to escape his confines of the Netherealm. The war is now being fought once again, and this time it can be won by mortals.\n- The Words of Raiden\n\nNo Special System Requirements.\n\nInstallation:  \n1. Run Installation From Setup.\n2.
