He had eaten lobster everywhere he could find it, from fresh-off-the-dock to dive bars, and was left wondering why lobster could be so readily available (and so reasonably priced) at the source but reserved for high-end restaurants across the rest of the country. He pledged then and there to bring lobster to the masses.\n\nThe Great Lobster Cookbook includes more than 100 of MattÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best recipesÃ¢â‚¬â€from the famous Rock Lobster Roll and the Classic Lobster Boil to Lobster Eggs Benny, Lobster Poutine, and even a mouthwatering recipe for Vanilla Bean Lobster Ice Cream. Star chefs, such as Mark McEwan and Roger Mooking, also share their favorite lobster dishes.\n\nWith easy-to-follow recipes, notes on lobster anatomy, and basic cooking techniques, Matt demystifies the lobster, highlighting its versatility and taking readers on a cross-country journey into its world, from claw to tail.\n\nA new cookbook classic for every lobster lover, The Great Lobster Cookbook shows that lobster doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need to be reserved for special occasions.
