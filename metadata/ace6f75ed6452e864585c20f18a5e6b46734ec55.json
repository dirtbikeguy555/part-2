It features standup comedy and sketches[1] united by a theme for each episode. It is script-edited by Chris Morris and was initially executive-produced by Armando Iannucci, marking a rare reformation of a creative team formed for On The Hour in 1991.\n\nLee has stated that this is exactly the sort of show he wants to do, saying &quot;I don't want to do any television that I don't have complete control of.\n\nIt is currently in its third series, and a fourth has been commissioned for 2015\n \n \n\nThe main body of the show is a Stewart Lee stand-up comedy performance, recorded live at the Mildmay Club in Stoke Newington with a club audience. Usually two episodes of the show were recorded per evening. Each episode has a theme, around which Lee performs his material.\n\nThe stand-up is punctuated with sketches, written by Lee but more usually performed by Simon Munnery, Kevin Eldon and Paul Putner, with cameos from other TV and circuit comedians. By Series 3, the sketches were removed in favour of a single short film at the end of each episode.\n\nA recurring element of the show is the &quot;hostile interrogator&quot;, played by Armando Iannucci for the first two series and by Chris Morris in Series 3. In a darkened room, the interrogator quizzes Lee about his approach to stand-up comedy and his attitudes toward his audience and the comedy industry. In Series 1, the interrogator segments were not included in the main programme, accessed instead via the BBC Red Button and included on the DVD releases as bonus features. Due to their popularity, interrogator segments were integrated into the main body of the show by Series 2\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Lee's_Comedy_Vehicle&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Lee's_Comedy_Vehicle&lt;/a&gt;\n \n \n\n=================== What's In This Torrent ===================\n \n\n \nStewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle - S03 - E01 - Shilbottle\nStewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle - S03 - E02 - England\nStewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle - S03 - E03 - Satire\nStewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle - S03 - E04 - Context \nStewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle - S03 - E05 - London \nStewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle - S03 - E06 - Marriage \n \n \n\n\n\n===================== General =====================\nComplete name               : Stewart Lee's Comedy Vehicle.avi\nFormat                      : AVI\nFormat info                 : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                   : 350 MB\nDuration (ms)               : 28mn 14s\nOverallBitRate_Mode/String  : Variable\nTotal bitrate               : 1 732 Kbps\nEncoded application         : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nEncoded library             : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\n===================== Video =====================\nId                          : 0\nFormat                      : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile              : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings - BVOP      : 1\nFormat settings - QPel      : No\nFormat settings - GMC       : No warppoints\nFormat settings - Matrix    : Custom\nCodec Id                    : XVID\nCodec                       : XviD\nDuration (ms)               : 28mn 14s\nBitrate                     : 1 619 Kbps\nWidth                       : 720 pixels\nHeight                      : 416 pixels\nAspect ratio                : 1.731\nFramerate                   : 25.000 fps\nColorimetry                 : YUV\nColos space                 : 4:2:0\nBit depth                   : 8 bits\nScan type                   : Progressive\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)          : 0.216\nStream size                 : 327 MB (93%)\nEncoded library             : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nId                          : 1\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\nFormat version              : Version 1\nFormat profile              : Layer 3\nFormat settings mode        : Joint stereo\nFormat settings mode extens : MS Stereo\nCodec Id                    : 55\nCodec                       : MP3\nDuration (ms)               : 28mn 14s\nBitrate mode                : Variable\nBitrate                     : 101 Kbps\nBitRate_Nominal/String      : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                  : 2 channels\nSampling rate               : 48.0 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nStream size                 : 20.4 MB (6%)\nAlignement                  : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave duration         : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\nInterleave preload          : 548 ms\nEncoded library             : LAME3.98r\nEncoded library settings    : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 --abr 128\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ace6f75ed6452e864585c20f18a5e6b46734ec55","amp;dn":"Stewart+Lee%27s+Comedy+Vehicle+-+S03+-+Standup+-+Xvid+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ace6f75ed6452e864585c20f18a5e6b46734ec55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,230,247,94,214,69,46,134,69,133,194,15,24,165,230,180,103,52,236,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
