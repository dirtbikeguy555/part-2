Salt Spring Island, one of the Gulf Islands in British Columbia, Canada, offered him a place to create the kind of architecture that responded to its surroundings, and Schubart-designed homes populate the island. Built of wood and glass, suffused with light, and oriented to views, they display characteristic features: random-width cedar siding, exposed beams, rusticated stonework. Over time, SchubartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s homes on Salt Spring Island came to be considered uniquely Gulf Islands homes.\n\nThis inviting book offers the first introduction to the life and architecture of West Coast modernist Henry A. Schubart, Jr. (1916Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1998). While still in his teens, Schubart persuaded Frank Lloyd Wright to accept him as a Taliesin Fellow, and his yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s apprenticeship in the masterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s workshop taught him principles of designing in harmony with nature that he explored throughout the rest of his life. Michele Dunkerley traces SchubartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s career from his early practice in San Francisco at the noted firm Wurster, Bernardi &amp; Emmons, to his successful firm with Howard Friedman, to his most lasting professional achievements on Salt Spring Island, where he became the de facto community architect, designing more than 230 residential, commercial, educational, and religious projects. Drawing lessons from his mentors over his decades on the island, he forged an everyday architecture with his mastery of detail and inventiveness. In doing so, he helped define how the island could grow without losing its soul. Color photographs and site plans display SchubartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s remarkable homes and other commissions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa7c89c6bdf2c7488043e9d4240d531778024bd1","amp;dn":"Houses+Made+of+Wood+and+Light+-+The+Life+and+Architecture+of+Han","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa7c89c6bdf2c7488043e9d4240d531778024bd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,124,137,198,189,242,199,72,128,67,233,212,36,13,83,23,120,2,75,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
