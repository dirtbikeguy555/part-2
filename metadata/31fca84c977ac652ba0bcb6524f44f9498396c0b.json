Pie Jesu\n\nBy Eric Smith\n\nThis has got to be the Best Andrew Lloyd Weber compilation album out there. It's more original then the others, for the famed musical &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot; we finally get a break from the typical cast which gets tiring...and get more of a pop feel with &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, and The guitars just make it sound cool! And not to mention of course a new singer for &quot;All I Ask of You.&quot; (A good break for those fans who have the Original London Cast Recording) The true masterpieces of this CD are: &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, &quot;Superstar&quot;, &quot;Memory&quot; (From the Best Grizabella Ever, Elaine Paige), &quot;Starlight Express&quot;, &quot;Tell Me On A Sunday&quot;, &quot;Another Suitcase in Another Hall&quot; (Thankfully we get two different singers with this one and &quot;Don't Cry for me Argentina&quot;), &quot;I Don't Know How To Love Him&quot; and the conluding Latin-sung &quot;Pie Jesu&quot; with Sarah Brightman...which is simply Beautiful! Well, all of these are Simply beautiful and this really is a Must Buy for any Andrew Lloyd Weber or Modern-day Broadway fan. I got this for my sister six or seven years ago and I still listen to it all the way thru to this very day! Just goes to show how monumental Weber was in the Modern Day world of Broadway and we will always remember his musicals as some of the best in Broadway. Definatly Reccomended! I give this CD an A++!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31fca84c977ac652ba0bcb6524f44f9498396c0b","amp;dn":"The+Best+of+Andrew+Lloyd+Webber+-+Premiere+Collection+320cbr+%28Bi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31fca84c977ac652ba0bcb6524f44f9498396c0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,252,168,76,151,122,198,82,186,11,203,101,36,244,79,148,152,57,108,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
