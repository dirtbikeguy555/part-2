It is considered to be one of the most detailed descriptions of the inner workings and leadership of Nazi Germany but is controversial because of Speer's lack of discussion of Nazi atrocities and questions regarding his degree of awareness or involvement with them. First published in 1969, it appeared in English translation in 1970.\r\n\r\nAt the Nuremberg Trials, Speer was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his use of slave labor while Minister of Armaments. From 1946 to 1966, while serving the sentence in Spandau Prison, he penned more than 2,000 manuscript pages of personal memoirs. Because he was not allowed to write such memoirs while in prison, he smuggled these notes out and returned to them after his release. He was aided by Joachim Fest. The manuscript led to two books: first Erinnerungen (&quot;Recollections&quot;) (PropylÃ¤en/Ullstein, 1969), which was translated into English and published by Macmillan in 1970 as Inside the Third Reich; then as Spandauer TagebÃ¼cher (&quot;Spandau Diaries&quot;) (PropylÃ¤en/Ullstein, 1975), which was translated into English and published by Macmillan in 1976 as Spandau: The Secret Diaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nCover of the first edition\r\nAuthor Albert Speer\r\nOriginal title Erinnerungen\r\nTranslator Richard and Clara Winston\r\nLanguage German\r\nSubject Autobiography\r\nHistory\r\nPublisher Orion Books\r\nPublication date\r\n1970, 1995 &amp; 2003\r\nMedia type Print\r\nPages 832\r\nISBN 978-1-84212-735-3\r\nOCLC 87656\r\n\r\n=======================================\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/shtihl22\r\n\r\n=======================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5eea6ea46076fe02943cf5a013cfb0a53942d0ec","amp;dn":"Inside+the+Third+Reich+-+1997+-+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5eea6ea46076fe02943cf5a013cfb0a53942d0ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,234,110,164,96,118,254,2,148,60,245,160,19,207,176,165,57,66,208,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
