Fisher (Michael Elphick), a retired policeman, returns to Europe at the behest of his mentor, Osborne (Esmond Knight of The Red Shoes). Osborne, the author of an influential textbook called The Element of Crime, has given up his investigation into the Lotto Murders, in which a number of lottery ticket salesgirls have been killed and mutilated. The new chief of police, Kramer (former Benny Hill Show regular Jerold Wells), is a trigger-happy lunatic who objects to Fisher's methodical approach to crime solving. Osborne, meanwhile, seemingly losing his grip on reality, insists that the killer, Harry Grey, died in a car crash. Using Osborne's methods, Fisher tries to delve into the mind of Grey by following the path of a trip the killer took three years earlier, while Osborne was investigating him. Along the way, Fisher hooks up with a prostitute, Kim (Me Me Lai), who also has a link to Grey. As he gets closer to unraveling the mystery, Fisher finds himself taking on more and more aspects of the killer's persona. Von Trier uses a traditional film noir style voice-over, while visually, his film is a monochromatic sepia tone with occasional flashes of fluorescent blue.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : The Element of Crime.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 43mn\n      Bit rate : 1886 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 6.60 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n      IAS1 : English\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Custom\n      PlayTime : 1h 43mn\n      Bit rate : 1691 Kbps\n      Width : 720 pixels\n      Height : 400 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 16/9\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.244\n      StreamSize : 1.22 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 1h 43mn\n      Bit rate : 191 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Video0 delay : 14ms\n      StreamSize : 142 MiB\n\nIMDB: tt0087280\n\nEnglish audio; English, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nCriterion Collection rip, posted at Karagarga by vanjah (Extras stripped)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc4b99ac6fe2ea3d23173f05c95f9cda6870683d","amp;dn":"The+Element+Of+Crime+%28Lars+von+Trier%2C+1984%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc4b99ac6fe2ea3d23173f05c95f9cda6870683d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,75,153,172,111,226,234,61,35,23,63,5,201,95,156,218,104,112,104,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
