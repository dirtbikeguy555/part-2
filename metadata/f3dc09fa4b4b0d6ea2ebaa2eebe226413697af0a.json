CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t do it? You donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to! Adam has done it for you!\n\nPodcast king Adam Carolla first shared his unique, but always funny world view in his New York Times best seller, In Fifty Years WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll All Be Chicks - but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not done.\n\nIn President Me, Carolla shares his vision for a different, better America free from big issues like big government down to small problems like hotel alarm clock placement. Running on an anti-narcissism platform, President Carolla calls for a return to the values of an earlier time when stew and casserole were on every dinner table and there were no Ã¢â‚¬Å“service dogsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on airplanes. President Me hits right at the heart of what makes our country really annoying, and offers a plan to make all of our lives, but mostly AdamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, much better.
