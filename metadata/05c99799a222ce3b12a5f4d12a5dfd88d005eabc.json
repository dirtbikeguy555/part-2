After spending \n\nseveral years busking and performing in the area, Reed moved to \n\nChicago, Illinois in 1943 before being drafted into the United States \n\nNavy during World War II. In 1945, Reed was discharged and moved back \n\nto Mississippi for a brief period, marrying his girlfriend, Mary &quot;Mama&quot; \n\nReed, before moving to Gary, Indiana to work at an Armour &amp; Co. meat \n\npacking plant.\n\nReed&amp;#039;s crossover appeal peaked during the revival of interest in the \n\nblues during the early Sixties, a period that found him playing such \n\nhallowed venues as Carnegie Hall and the Apollo Theater. He also toured \n\nEngland, where he was revered by musicians such as the Rolling Stones, \n\nwho covered &quot;Honest I Do,&quot; and Van Morrison, who recorded &quot;Bright \n\nLights, Big City&quot; while with the group Them. Back in America, Reed&amp;#039;s \n\ninfluence extended to such groups as the Grateful Dead, who performed \n\nhis songs in their jugband days and recorded &quot;Big Boss Man&quot; on a 1971 \n\nlive album.\n\nJimmy Reed died in 1976, a few days short of his 51st birthday. He is \n\ninterred in the Lincoln Cemetery in Worth, Illinois.\n\nIn 1991 Jimmy Reed was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\n2 Albums:\n\n1. The Very Best of (40 tracks)\n2.
