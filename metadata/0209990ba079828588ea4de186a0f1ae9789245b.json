Fred (Bill Pullman) is an avant-garde jazz saxophonist who shares a luxurious but fashionably barren house with his wife Renee (Patricia Arquette). Fred suspects that Renee may be unfaithful to him, but realizes he has bigger things to worry about when a series of videotapes appear at his door that prove someone is watching his home from the outside and inside. When Renee is found murdered, Fred finds himself behind bars, but one morning Fred is no longer in his cell. He has seemingly been transformed into Pete Drayton (Balthazar Getty), a young auto mechanic who foolishly allowed himself to get involved with the wife of gangster Dick Laurent (Robert Loggia), a luscious blonde named Alice who looks exactly like Renee.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Lost Highway (1997).avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format profile : OpenDML\n      File size : 1.99 GiB\n      Duration : 2h 14mn\n      Overall bit rate : 2 127 Kbps\n      Movie name : S\n      Director : K\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2542/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2542/release\n      Copyright : h\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 2h 14mn\n      Bit rate : 1 666 Kbps\n      Width : 720 pixels\n      Height : 304 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 2.35:1\n      Frame rate : 24.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.317\n      Stream size : 1.56 GiB (78%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 2h 14mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 448 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 6 channels\n      Channel positions : Front: L C R, Surround: L R, LFE\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 430 MiB (21%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116922/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116922/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio: English and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted at KG by robertrath, whom we thank\n\nDavid Lynch - Lost Highway (1997)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0209990ba079828588ea4de186a0f1ae9789245b","amp;dn":"David+Lynch+-+Lost+Highway+%281997%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0209990ba079828588ea4de186a0f1ae9789245b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,9,153,11,160,121,130,133,136,234,77,225,134,160,241,174,151,137,36,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
