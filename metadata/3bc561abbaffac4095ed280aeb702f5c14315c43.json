An essential volume in any serious craftperson's library, this book covers setting up a smithy (anvil, forge, hammer, tongs, and all), and manufacturing everything from stone-carving chisels to decorative wall hooks.\n\n\nBy Alexander Weygers\nPublished by Ten Speed Press in 1997\nEPUB, Retail, 304 pages, English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bc561abbaffac4095ed280aeb702f5c14315c43","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Modern+Blacksmith%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bc561abbaffac4095ed280aeb702f5c14315c43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,197,97,171,186,255,172,64,149,237,40,10,235,112,47,92,20,49,92,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
