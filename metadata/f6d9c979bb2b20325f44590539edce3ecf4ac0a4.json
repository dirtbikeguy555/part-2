He finds himself forced to defend his home against an assault by local toughs, and discovers a frighteningly feral and vicious side to himself. Though Straw Dogs has a reputation for graphic violence, it actually looks tame by contemporary standards. Instead, the violence is psychological, and the suspense and shocks are induced by the editing--you're more terrified by what you think you see than by what you are actually shown.\n\n  Starring: Dustin Hoffman, Susan George, Peter Vaughan, T.P. McKenna.\n\n  Directed by: Sam Peckinpah.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 1hr. 58min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 688 x 400\n\n  Frame Rate: 23fps\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6d9c979bb2b20325f44590539edce3ecf4ac0a4","amp;dn":"Straw+Dogs+%281971%29+%28Dustin+Hoffman%2C+Susan+George%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6d9c979bb2b20325f44590539edce3ecf4ac0a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,217,201,121,187,43,32,50,95,68,89,5,57,237,206,62,207,74,192,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
