His earliest recognition, in fact, came as a songwriter associated with the Brill Building era of Tin Pan Alley in the early '60s. But he soon branched out into recording and performing, and by the early '70s was topping the charts with the self-written singles &quot;Cracklin' Rosie&quot; and &quot;Song Sung Blue.&quot; This enabled him to be one of the more noticeable figures in the singer/songwriter movement of the period, as he made a transition to more of an album artist and those albums began to earn gold and platinum certifications. He also developed into a dynamic concert performer, as demonstrated on his 1972 album Hot August Night. At the same time, however, his music became generally softer, which broadened his appeal while earning him opprobrium, when he was considered at all, by the rock critics who dominated pop music journalism. But his millions of fans didn't care about that, and they flocked to his shows and bought his albums in big numbers until well into the 1980s. After that, while his concert tours continued to post high grosses, his record sales became more modest. Still, as of 2001, he claimed worldwide record sales of 115 million copies, and as of 2002 he was ranked third, behind only Elton John and Barbra Streisand, on the list of the most successful adult contemporary artists in the history of the Billboard chart.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\nDisc One\n\n01.Solitary Man (Mono Version)\n02.Cherry, Cherry (Mono Version)\n03.I Got The Feelin' (Oh No, No) (Mono Version)\n04.Kentucky Woman (Mono Version)\n05.Girl, You'll Be A Woman Soon (Mono Version)\n06.You Got To Me (Mono Version)\n07.Red, Red Wine (Mono Version)\n08.Thank The Lord For The Night Time (Mono Version)\n09.I'm A Believer (Mono Version)\n10.Sweet Caroline\n11.Song Sung Blue\n12.Holly Holy\n13.I Am...I Said\n14.Cracklin' Rosie\n15.Play Me (Live)\n16.Morningside (Live)\n17.Crunchy Granola Suite (Live)\n18.Brooklyn Roads (Live)\n19.Soolaimon (Live)\n\n\nDisc Two\n\n01.America\n02.Hello Again\n03.Love On The Rocks\n04.Captain Sunshine (Live)\n05.He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother (Live)\n06.Yes I WillLady Magdalene (Live)\n07.Shilo (Live)\n08.Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show (Live)\n09.If You Know What I Mean\n10.Beautiful Noise\n11.You Don't Bring Me Flowers (With Barbra Streisand)\n12.DesirÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e\n13.Forever In Blue Jeans\n14.September Morn\n15.I've Been This Way Before\n16.Yesterday's Songs\n17.Heartlight\n18.Headed For The Future\n19.You Are The Best Part Of Me\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:017eaa415ecbd901c2a2943a19c438e130863b92","amp;dn":"Neil+Diamond+-+The+Essential+Neil+Diamond+%282001%29+mp3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"017eaa415ecbd901c2a2943a19c438e130863b92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,126,170,65,94,203,217,1,194,162,148,58,25,196,56,225,48,134,59,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
