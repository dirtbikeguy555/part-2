The opening song of this cd is probably the most normal of the disc. I think it's safe to say it's the &quot;terminator&quot; theme.\n\nI'll describe the entire soundtrack's overall feel to me in one paragraph -\n\nA mix of synthetic low atmospheric drones and squeeling sounds that combine to make menacing tones ( mainly used for the T-1000's music ). Eerie churchbell loops , synthetic snaredrum marching music with sampled cellos and live(?) dissonant horns. If you watch the movie and then listen to the soundtrack you'll like it alot better.\n\nOne of the best things I liked about the soundtrack though is that what I thought ( when I watched the movie ) were sound effects dubbed in were actually part of the soundtrack. Like the part where the terminator pulls the wheel out the T-1000's hand in the truck and it flips over the sound of the metal squeeling on the ground is actually part of the soundtrack! It's really amazing that such a bizzare and eerie soundtrack worked for this movie so well.\n\nI give it 5 stars for it's originality and excellent continutity with the movie.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ca9955d495965d11e46f505e24490fac1034e75","amp;dn":"Terminator+2+Judgement+Day+-+Motion+Picture+Soundtrack+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ca9955d495965d11e46f505e24490fac1034e75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,169,149,93,73,89,101,209,30,70,245,5,226,68,144,250,193,3,78,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
