Often, you'd hear a catchier, dancier pop &quot;radio edit&quot; of a song and find the mix on the album to be less appealing, sometimes to the extreme of sounding like a completely different song. It was for this reason that I had avoided Shania's &quot;Come On Over&quot; release, since I liked what I heard on the radio, but disliked the &quot;country mixes&quot; I heard while sampling her original CD. So I was pleasantly surprised to see that her record company has come to thier senses and released this &quot;International Version&quot; to compensate for those of us that prefer the remixed pop Shania. From &quot;Don't Impress Me Much&quot; and &quot;From this Moment On&quot; I realize she's had 4 successful singles from this album, and they're all here--for less than the price of buying one import single containing any of these mixes. If you're like me and resisted the original, buy this one--you won't be disappointed!\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nShania Twain - Come on Over\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Shania Twain\nAlbum................: Come on Over\nGenre................: Country\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1997\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: LAME 3.99\nVersion..............: MPEG 1 Layer III\nQuality..............: Insane, (avg. bitrate: 320kbps)\nChannels.............: Joint Stereo / 44100 hz\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.
