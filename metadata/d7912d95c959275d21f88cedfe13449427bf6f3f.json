What makes wood floors so desirable? Hardwood floors are unmatched for their beauty, durability, and ease of maintenance, so it's no surprise that the demand for hardwood has always been strong. In recent years that demand has been fueled by the availability of more types of wood, including exotic species such as Brazilian cherry, as well as engineered woods. This professional-level resource covers every aspect of installing residential wood flooring - from estimating and preparing the job site, through sanding and finishing, to repairs and maintenance. Hardwood floor expert Charles Peterson covers it all in this indispensable guide to the most popular flooring choice around.\n\n==========================================\n\nCare of Wooden Floors \n\nPublisher: Little A / New Harvest\n2012\nWill Wiles \nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0547953569\nISBN-13: 978-0547953564\nPDF,EPUB,MOBI\n304 pages\n1.95 MB\n\nA witty debut novel about a housesitting gig gone terribly, hilariously wrong.\n \nA British copywriter stays for a week at his composer friend OskarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s elegant, ultramodern apartment in a glum Eastern European city. The instructions are simple: feed the cats, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t touch the piano, and make sure nothing harms the priceless wooden floors. Content for the first time in ages, he accidentally spills some wine. Over the course of a week, both the apartment and the narratorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sanity fall apart in this original and Ã¢â‚¬Å“weirdly addictiveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Daily Mail) novel.\n \nAs the situation in and out of the sleek apartment spirals out of control, more of OskarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s notes appear, taking on an insistentÃ¢â‚¬â€even sinisterÃ¢â‚¬â€tone. Care of Wooden Floors is a must-read for anyone whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever bungled a housesitting gig, or felt inferior to a perfectionist friendÃ¢â‚¬â€that is to say, all of us","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7912d95c959275d21f88cedfe13449427bf6f3f","amp;dn":"Wood+Flooring%3A+Layout%2C+Installation+%26amp%3B+Finishing+%2B+Care+of+Wo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7912d95c959275d21f88cedfe13449427bf6f3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,145,45,149,201,89,39,93,33,248,140,237,254,19,68,148,39,191,111,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
