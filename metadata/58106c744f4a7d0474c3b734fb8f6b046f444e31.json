These were supplemented by other items relating to ChandlerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life, both broadcast and on Radio 4ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s web-sites.\n\nI have tried to gather them all together and make them available through this torrent. It contains the dramatisations, sequentially numbered, broadcast on the Saturday Play, viz:\n\n1. The Big Sleep\n2. The Lady in the Lake\n3. Farewell My Lovely\n4. Playback\n5. The Long Goodbye\n6. The High Window\n7. The Little Sister\n8. Poodle Springs\n\nThe last of these, Poodle Springs, was unfinished at the time of ChandlerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death in 1959, but was completed by crime writer Robert B. Parker to mark the centenary of Chandler's birth in 1988.\n\nThere are also two Afternoon Plays by Stephen Wyatt. Double Jeopardy is a play starring Patrick Stewart as Raymond Chandler about ChandlerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfamously difficult collaborationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with Billy Wilder on a screen adaptation of James M Cain's novel Double Indemnity, while Strangers on a Film dramatises another problematic collaboration with Alfred Hitchcock on a screenplay based on Patricia Highsmith's novel Strangers on a Train.\n\nIn addition to this, there is a feature upon ChandlerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s life, A Coat, a Hat and a Gun, a recording of Raymond Chandler and Ian FlemingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s conversation in 1958, and the soundtrack of a short video in which Toby Stephens talks about playing Philip Marlowe.\n\nDocuments relating to the plays are also included.\n\nThe mp3 files are, apart from the Fleming conversation, in 16 Bit stereo, and are coded to a relatively low bitrate, 64kbps, because this produces much smaller file sizes and in my opinion, following tests, does not impair quality discernibly in these speech recordings. Frequency is 22,050 Hz.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58106c744f4a7d0474c3b734fb8f6b046f444e31","amp;dn":"The+Raymond+Chandler+Audiobook+Collection++%28BBC+Drama%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58106c744f4a7d0474c3b734fb8f6b046f444e31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,16,108,116,79,74,125,4,116,195,183,52,251,143,107,4,111,68,78,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
