IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m calling it &quot;4.0? and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the biggest and best version of Evernote Essentials yet.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a little different for a couple of reasons:\n\nIn addition to the PDF version thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been around since the beginning, Evernote Essentials is also available as an DRM-free ePub (which you can read on many different devices including the iPad and iPhone using iBooks) and a Kindle-compatible .MOBI file. All of these files are included in the download youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll receive after purchasing Evernote Essentials.\nBy very popular demand, Evernote Essentials is now available in the iBookstore!\nIncluded in this new version are several new chapters, including two special chapters that my customers have been asking for since pretty much the beginning:\n\nHow to set up a new Evernote account\nHow I use Evernote\n\nAnd, of course, the text has been updated to include all of the latest* features and updates to the Evernote applications. It even has a fancy new cover!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d39478b2a31fe597224f22fe1dba5b6da372b8eb","amp;dn":"Evernote+Essentials+4.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d39478b2a31fe597224f22fe1dba5b6da372b8eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,148,120,178,163,31,229,151,34,79,34,254,29,186,91,109,163,114,184,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
