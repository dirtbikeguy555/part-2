As the kings of earnest country-inflected ...    Full Descriptionrock in an age when radical stances were de rigueur, CCR sported straight-ahead tunes, and may have seemed a bit unhip. But their music stands the test of time with a vengeance. For the doubtful listener, this outstanding, 20-track hits collection has evidence of their greatness in staggering abundance.\n\nThough they produced several excellent albums, Creedence was predominantly a singles band, and CHRONICLE compiles many of their biggest hits. From the slowly building saunter of &quot;Suzie Q&quot; and the spooky, R&amp;B-soaked &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot; to the fierce &quot;Fortunate Son&quot; and the swampy blues of &quot;Run Through the Jungle,&quot; CHRONICLE features the ensemble's signature tunes. Beautifully melancholy songs &quot;Who'll Stop the Rain&quot; and &quot;Someday Never Comes&quot; play off sunny, melodic anthems &quot;Down on the Corner&quot; and &quot;Lookin' Out My Back Door,&quot; fully revealing the band's wide range. The group's tight, no-frills musicianship leaves John Fogerty's keening voice and superb songwriting at the fore, and the results--brought together here on one of rock's best greatest-hits packages--make for some of the genre's most endearing and enduring music.\n\n\n 1.
