Kernighan, Dennis M. Ritchie\nPublisher: Prentice Hall\nDate: 1988\nPages: 288\nFormat: PDF\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0131103628\nISBN-13: 978-0131103627\nSize: 15.93 MB\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDescription:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe authors present the complete guide to ANSI standard C language programming. Written by the developers of C, this new version helps readers keep up with the finalized ANSI standard for C while showing how to take advantage of C&amp;39;s rich set of operators, economy of expression, improved control flow, and data structures. \n\nThe 2/E has been completely rewritten with additional examples and problem sets to clarify the implementation of difficult language constructs. For years, C programmers have let K&amp;R guide them to building well-structured and efficient programs. Now this same help is available to those working with ANSI compilers. \n\nIncludes detailed coverage of the C language plus the official C language reference manual for at-a-glance help with syntax notation, declarations, ANSI changes, scope rules, and the list goes on and on.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout the Author:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBrian W. Kernighan received his BASc from the University of Toronto in 1964 and a PhD in electrical engineering from Princeton in 1969. He was a member of the Computing Science Research center at Bell Labs until 2000, and is now a professor in the Computer Science Department at Princeton. He was a co-creator of several programming languages, including AWK, AMPL, and a number of tools for document preparation. \n\nHe is the co-author of 10 books and some technical papers, and holds 4 patents. He was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2002. His research areas include programming languages, tools and interfaces that make computers easier to use, often for non-specialist users. He is also interested in technology education for non-technical audiences. \n\nDennis Ritchie was a computer scientist notable for his influence on ALTRAN, B, BCPL, C, Multics, and Unix.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAmazon Customer Ratings (355 Reviews):\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n5 star: (287)\n4 star: (38)\n3 star: (17)\n2 star: (6)\n1 star: (7)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNo Password or Surveys.
