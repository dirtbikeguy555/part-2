Now in paperback: the book that Andrew Weil calls Ã¢â‚¬Å“offbeat, informative, and fun . . . a great read,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and that has been praised as Ã¢â‚¬Å“a delightful dance through scienceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (New York Times bestselling author Mark Hyman, M.D.) and as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“remarkable and insightful book [that] offers you the chance to achieve the best health of your lifeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Mark Liponis, M.D., Medical Director, Canyon Ranch).\n\n Written by bestselling author Gene Stone, The Secrets of People Who Never Get Sick arose from his desire to discover what might actually prevent him from getting sick himself. This book, the result of that exploration, tells the stories of twenty-five people who each possess a different secret of excellent healthÃ¢â‚¬â€a secret that makes sense and that Stone discovered has a true scientific underpinning. There are food secretsÃ¢â‚¬â€why to take garlic and vitamin C, eat more probiotics, become\n a vegan, drink a tonic of brewerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s yeast. Exercise secretsÃ¢â‚¬â€the benefits of lifting weights, the power of stretching. Environmental secretsÃ¢â‚¬â€living in a Blue Zone, understanding the value of germs. Emotional secretsÃ¢â‚¬â€seek out and stay in touch with friends, cultivate your spirituality. Physical secretsÃ¢â‚¬â€nap more, take cold showers in the morning. And the wisdom that goes back generations: Yes, chicken soup works.\n\n The stories make it personal, the research makes it real, and the do-it-yourself information shows how to integrate each secret into your own life, and become the next person who never gets sick.\n\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ace7673d7097bb43fa1e73e3218ffb2466dda6a","amp;dn":"The+Secrets+of+People+Who+Never+Get+Sick%3A+What+They+Know%2C+Why+It","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ace7673d7097bb43fa1e73e3218ffb2466dda6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,206,118,115,215,9,123,180,63,161,231,62,50,24,255,178,70,109,218,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
