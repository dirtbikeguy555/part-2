Redundant material relating to the now defunct British Standards - no longer referred to in degree teaching - has been removed.\n\nBuilding on the success of the earlier editions, this 9th edition of SmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Elements of Soil Mechanics brings additional material on geotechnical design to Eurocode 7 in an understandable format. Many worked examples are included to illustrate the processes for performing design to this European standard.\n\nSignificant updates throughout the book have been made to reflect other developments in procedures and practices in the construction and site investigation industries. More worked examples and many new figures have been provided throughout. The illustrations have been improved and the new design and layout of the pages give a lift.\n\nunique content to illustrate the use of Eurocode 7 with essential guidance on how to use the now fully published code\nclear content and well-organised structure\ntakes complicated theories and processes and presents them in easy-to-understand formats","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d21773927351f50c249a573c4ad1d20854d068f1","amp;dn":"Smith%27s+Elements+of+Soil+Mechanics%2C+9E+%5BPDF%5D%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d21773927351f50c249a573c4ad1d20854d068f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,23,115,146,115,81,245,12,36,154,87,60,74,209,210,8,84,208,104,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
