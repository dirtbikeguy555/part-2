But her new home, while splendorous, is not welcoming. Johannes is kind yet distant, always locked in his study or at his warehouse officeÃ¢â‚¬â€leaving Nella alone with his sister, the sharp-tongued and forbidding Marin.\n\nBut NellaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world changes when Johannes presents her with an extraordinary wedding gift: a cabinet-sized replica of their home. To furnish her gift, Nella engages the services of a miniaturistÃ¢â‚¬â€an elusive and enigmatic artist whose tiny creations mirror their real-life counterparts in eerie and unexpected ways . . .\n\nJohannesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ gift helps Nella to pierce the closed world of the Brandt household. But as she uncovers its unusual secrets, she begins to understandÃ¢â‚¬â€and fearÃ¢â‚¬â€the escalating dangers that await them all. In this repressively pious society where gold is worshipped second only to God, to be different is a threat to the moral fabric of society, and not even a man as rich as Johannes is safe. Only one person seems to see the fate that awaits them. Is the miniaturist the key to their salvation . . . or the architect of their destruction?\n\nEnchanting, beautiful, and exquisitely suspenseful, The Miniaturist is a magnificent story of love and obsession, betrayal and retribution, appearance and truth.\n\nReview\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A fabulously gripping read that will appeal to fans of Girl With a Pearl Earring and The Goldfinch, but Burton is a genuinely new voice with her visceral take on sex, race and class...Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Ã¢â‚¬â€The Guardian)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Miniaturist is that rarest of things - beautifully written, yet also a compelling page-turner. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s haunting, magical, and full of surprises, the kind of book that reminds you why you fell in love with reading.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Ã¢â‚¬â€S.J. Watson, author of *Before I Go To Sleep*)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœUtterly transporting...one of those rare debut novels that excels in every regard. The past is brought to life in potent, sensory detail: one feels steeped in it. BurtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s prose beguiles the reader...My first instinct on finishing this book was to immediately read it again.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Hannah Kent, author of Burial Rites)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“BurtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s writing is expressive and descriptive. While her prose is rich, it does not overwhelm the story...This historical novel with its strong female characters will appeal to those who enjoy the haunting undercurrents of Carlos Ruiz ZafonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Shadow of the Wind.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Ã¢â‚¬â€Library Journal)\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This debut novel, set in 17th-century Amsterdam, hits all the marks of crossover success: taut suspense, a pluck heroine- and a possibly clairvoyant miniature-furniture designer.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Ã¢â‚¬â€New York magazine)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49f58a9d6428f0077223584f17c1137a68f494d7","amp;dn":"The+Miniaturist+-+Jessie+Burton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49f58a9d6428f0077223584f17c1137a68f494d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,245,138,157,100,40,240,7,114,35,88,79,23,193,19,122,104,244,148,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
