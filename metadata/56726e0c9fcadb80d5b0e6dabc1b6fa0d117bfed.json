These initially included Warhammer Fantasy Battle, Warhammer 40,000, and Necromunda, and later added the Mordheim and Gorkamorka settings. \nInferno! had a policy of accepting unsolicited submissions and publishing new authors. Many writers who went on to publish novels for Black Library, such as C.L. Werner and Ben Counter, began their professional writing careers with short stories in Inferno! The magazine also published stories by established science fiction authors such as Barrington J. Bayley and Brian Stableford.\nThe success of Inferno!, along with the lessons learned and the contacts made during its early days, led to a spin-off comic, Warhammer Monthly. \nAll the currently scanned issues of Inferno! have been included in this pack.\n\n\nWarhammer Monthly\nWarhammer Monthly was a comics anthology published by Games Workshop's publishing arm, Black Library, from March 1998 to December 2004, running to 86 issues in total. The final two issues were published bi-monthly under the name Warhammer Comic. It featured stories set within the fictional universe of Games Workshop's miniature wargames Warhammer and Warhammer 40,000, amongst others.\nThe comic used an anthology format, usually featuring three or four stories each of seven to eight pages in length. The stories in Warhammer Monthly were usually serialised, and would run for several months. The most popular stories returned for more series, and were often collected in trade paperback form.\nWarhammer Monthly was cancelled after issue 86 as sales were poor in comparison to the numerous novels Black Library were producing. In 2006, Games Workshop licensed the comic books rights to Boom! Studios.\n\n\nBoom! Studios\nIn 2006, Boom! Studios got the license from Games Workshop to produce a line of comic books and graphic novels based on Warhammer Fantasy and Warhammer 40,000. These comics are particularly notable for featuring the work of fan favorite Warhammer novelist and comic writer Dan Abnett.\n\nSeries include:\n\nWarhammer 40,000:\nDamnation Crusade\nBlood and Thunder\nExterminatus\nFire and Honour\nDefenders of Ultramar\n\nWarhammer Fantasy:\nForge of War \nCondemned by Fire\nCrown of Destruction\n\nAs of mid-2009, it seems as if Boom Studios has lost the license to Warhammer and Warhammer 40,000, as with no explanation or announcement they removed all the comics and novels from their website.\n\n\nDue to mature content and scenes of extreme gore this torrent comes with an ADULT rating.\n\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56726e0c9fcadb80d5b0e6dabc1b6fa0d117bfed","amp;dn":"Warhammer+Monthly+and+Warhammer+Comics+%5BADULT%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56726e0c9fcadb80d5b0e6dabc1b6fa0d117bfed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,114,110,12,159,202,219,128,213,176,230,218,188,27,111,160,209,23,191,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
