Since 1979, David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson's Film Art has been the best-selling and widely respected introduction to the analysis of cinema.\n\nTaking a skills-centered approach supported by a wide range of examples from various periods and countries, the authors strive to help students develop a core set of analytical skills that will deepen their understanding of any film, in any genre. Frame enlargements throughout the text enable students to view images taken directly from completed films, while an optional, text-specific tutorial CD-ROM helps clarify and reinforce specific concepts addressed in the text with the use of film clips. Building on these strengths, the ninth edition adds coverage of new technologies, updated examples, and references to the authors' acclaimed weblog to provide unparalleled currency and connect students with the world of cinema today.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a55536ec5d204a6c136abca6ceee04879746e329","amp;dn":"Film+Art_+An+Introduction+-Bordwell%2FThompson-+-Mobi-+%5BSlender%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a55536ec5d204a6c136abca6ceee04879746e329","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,85,54,236,93,32,74,108,19,106,188,166,206,238,4,135,151,70,227,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
