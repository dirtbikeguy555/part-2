The boys have races and do crazy things with cars (anything from driving them into swimming pools to setting them on fire). Oh and there is always an earnest attempt to kill Richard Hammond every series.\n\nThis is the whole of Season 10, each show being 445MB so it can fit onto a single DVD5 (10 Shows).\n\nRelease Dates: 07/10/07 to 23/12/07\nVideo: XVID\nAudio: MP3 VBR\nSource: DVB-T\n\nPlease Seed, DsG!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d8415cb037085c55f5380375b08970677c5ebae","amp;dn":"Top.Gear.Season.10%5BDVBRip%5DXVID.MP3-DsG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d8415cb037085c55f5380375b08970677c5ebae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,132,21,203,3,112,133,197,95,83,128,55,91,8,151,6,119,197,235,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
