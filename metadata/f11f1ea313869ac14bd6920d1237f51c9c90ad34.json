Filled with a cast of unforgettable characters more richly drawn than any Lehane has ever created, The Given Day tells the story of two familiesâ€”one black, one whiteâ€”swept up in a maelstrom of revolutionaries and anarchists, immigrants and ward bosses, Brahmins and ordinary citizens, all engaged in a battle for survival and power. Beat cop Danny Coughlin, the son of one of the city's most beloved and powerful police captains, joins a burgeoning union movement and the hunt for violent radicals. Luther Laurence, on the run after a deadly confrontation with a crime boss in Tulsa, works for the Coughlin family and tries desperately to find his way home to his pregnant wife.\n\nHere, too, are some of the most influential figures of the eraâ€”Babe Ruth; Eugene O'Neill; leftist activist Jack Reed; NAACP founder W. E. B. DuBois; Mitchell Palmer, Woodrow Wilson's ruthless Red-chasing attorney general; cunning Massachusetts governor Calvin Coolidge; and an ambitious young Department of Justice lawyer named John Hoover.\n\nCoursing through some of the pivotal events of the timeâ€”including the Spanish Influenza pandemicâ€”and culminating in the Boston Police Strike of 1919, The Given Day explores the crippling violence and irrepressible exuberance of a country at war with, and in the thrall of, itself. As Danny, Luther, and those around them struggle to define themselves in increasingly turbulent times, they gradually find family in one another and, together, ride a rising storm of hardship, deprivation, and hope that will change all their lives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f11f1ea313869ac14bd6920d1237f51c9c90ad34","amp;dn":"THE+GIVEN+DAY+-+Dennis+Lehane+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f11f1ea313869ac14bd6920d1237f51c9c90ad34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,31,30,163,19,134,154,193,75,214,146,13,18,55,245,28,156,144,173,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
