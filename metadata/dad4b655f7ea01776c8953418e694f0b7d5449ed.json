It is a film-within-a-film, featuring Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon playing themselves as egotistical actors during the making of a screen adaptation of Laurence Sterne's 18th century metafictional novel Tristram Shandy. Gillian Anderson and Keeley Hawes also play themselves in addition to their Tristram Shandy roles. Since the book is about a man attempting but failing to write his autobiography, the film takes the form of being about failing to make the film.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dad4b655f7ea01776c8953418e694f0b7d5449ed","amp;dn":"Tristram+Shandy%3A+A+Cock+and+Bull+Story+2005","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dad4b655f7ea01776c8953418e694f0b7d5449ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,212,182,85,247,234,1,119,108,137,83,65,142,105,79,11,125,84,73,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
