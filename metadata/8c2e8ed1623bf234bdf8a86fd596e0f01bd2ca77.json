Because no one can be an expert on everything, designers have always had to scramble to find the information and know-how required to make a design work until now.\n\nUniversal Principles of Design is the first comprehensive, cross-disciplinary encyclopedia of design. Richly illustrated and easy to navigate, it pairs clear explanations of every design concept with visual examples of the concepts applied in practice. From the &quot;80/20 rule to chunking, from baby-face bias to Ockham's razor, and from self-similarity to storytelling, every major design concept is defined and illustrated for readers to expand their knowledge.\n\nThis landmark reference will become the standard for designers, engineers, architects, and students who seek to broaden and improve their design expertise.\n\n\n\n\nSome of the chapters:\n\n80/20 Rule \nCognitive Dissonance \nCost-Benefit \nDepth of Processing \nExpectation Effect \nFigure-Ground Relationship \nFitts' Law \nFlexibility-Usability Tradeoff \nHick's Law \nLaw of Pragnanz \nAppearance Effect \nPerformance Versus Preference \nPicture Superiority Effect \nRule of Thirds \nSerial Position Effects \nThree-Dimensional Projection \nTop-Down Lighting Bias \nUncertainty Principle \nvon Restorff Effect \nWaist-to-Hip Ratio \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c2e8ed1623bf234bdf8a86fd596e0f01bd2ca77","amp;dn":"Universal+Principles+of+Design_2003.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c2e8ed1623bf234bdf8a86fd596e0f01bd2ca77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,46,142,209,98,59,242,52,189,248,168,111,213,150,224,240,27,210,202,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
