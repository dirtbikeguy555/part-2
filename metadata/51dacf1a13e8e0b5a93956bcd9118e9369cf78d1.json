With five vivid delay modes and advanced options, this effect delivers pure inspiration.\r\n\r\nA TOOL FOR ALL OCCASIONS\r\nFive deeply modeled delay modes span crisp digital repeats, analog warmth, and experimental textures. Advanced options offer fast ways to open up your mix with pinpoint creative control. And an elegant interface puts new possibilities right before your eyes. From single instruments to entire mixes, REPLIKA XT will add new character to your music.\r\n\r\nFIVE WAYS TO DELAY\r\nEach of the five modes was inspired by some of the most revered delays in history, making REPLIKA XT an all-in-one solution for distinctive, high-quality echoes, space, and width.\r\n\r\nModern delivers clean, precise, controllable repeats.\r\nVintage Digital offers warm, crunchy repeats modeled after early samplers and digital delays.\r\nAnalogue replicates the dark, hazy sound of analog bucket-brigade pedals.\r\nTape provides the organic quality of famous tape echo units and the punchy, smooth sound of tape.\r\nDiffusion is something entirely its own â€“ swirling reverberant echoes that no physical space can provide.\r\n\r\nEASY TO REPEAT\r\nREPLIKA XT makes it easy to create sophisticated rhythms, widen your mix, or explore a universe of sound design possibilities. Use the pattern controls to quickly create rhythmic repeats that shift organically with the music. Dial in the perfect stereo image with panning for each delay and dry signal, or adjust ducking time to keep percussive hits tight â€“ uncompromising control at a glance.\r\n\r\nSEVEN STEPS TO EFFECTION\r\nCombine the delay modes with pristine effects to produce classic mixing tricks, and add shimmer, dimension, and motion to your music. REPLIKA XT includes seven time-based and pitch effects to add to your repeats. Or turn the delay down and use them on their own.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nDo not make money with this software...\r\n\r\nRemember to BUY the stuff if you USE it.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nfuture-dada\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\ndemonoid.pw\r\n1337x.to\r\nthepiratebay.se\r\nflashtorrents.org\r\nbtscene.cc\r\ntorrent-core.org\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nMMXVI (05)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51dacf1a13e8e0b5a93956bcd9118e9369cf78d1","amp;dn":"Native+Instruments+-+Replika+XT+v1.0.1+OS+X+%5Bdada%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51dacf1a13e8e0b5a93956bcd9118e9369cf78d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,218,207,26,19,232,224,181,169,57,86,188,217,17,142,147,105,207,120,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
