Traditional handbooks of heat transfer stress fundamental principles, analytical approaches to thermal problems, and elegant solutions to classical problems. The CRC Handbook of Thermal Engineering is not a traditional handbook. Engineers in industry need up-to-date, accessible information on the applications of heat and mass transfer-The CRC Handbook of Thermal Engineering provides it.\r\nPeer reviewed articles-selected on the basis of their current relevance to the development of new products-provide in-depth treatment of applications in diverse fields, such as:\r\nBioengineering\r\nDesalination\r\nElectronics\r\nEnergy conservation\r\nFood processing\r\nMeasurement techniques in fluid flow and heat transfer\r\n\r\nYou'll find complete, up-to-date information on the latest development in the field, including:\r\nRecent advances in thermal sciences\r\nMicrothermal design\r\nCompact heat exchangers\r\nThermal optimization\r\nExergy analysis\r\n\r\nA unique, one-stop resource for all your thermal engineering questions\r\nFrom the basics of thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat and mass transfer, to comprehensive treatment of current applications, the latest computational tools, to data tables for the properties of gases, liquids, and solids, The CRC Handbook of Thermal Engineering has it all!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:003fb5ed7b685faf4e3587b6f3ce62be8ff961ee","amp;dn":"The+CRC+Handbook+of+Thermal+Engineering+-+Frank+Kreith","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"003fb5ed7b685faf4e3587b6f3ce62be8ff961ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,63,181,237,123,104,95,175,78,53,135,182,243,206,98,190,143,249,97,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
