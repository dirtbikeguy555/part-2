It isn't arranged chronologically, which actually helps the programming by splitting up the covers over the course of the running order. \nThere's a bit more toughness to the earlier songs, both in the lyrics and the punchier performances. Yet in the end, the sonic differences are subtle enough that casual fans should still be able to enjoy them (unless they only want to hear the band performing reggae-pop versions of oldies they already know). Skimpy though it is, The Best of UB40, Vol. 1 is still the compilation for purists enamored of the band's early work, assuming they don't want to spend the money for the original albums. \nBut with its fairly well-balanced selection and inclusion of all the band's U.S. hits, most American listeners who want a UB40 compilation will find The Very Best of UB40 1980-2000 exactly what they're looking for. \n[The import version juggles the track listing and running order a bit, excising a couple of Labour of Love II's American cover hits in favor of older songs and reggae covers of Jamaican origin. Also, the version of &quot;Red Red Wine&quot; is the shortened edit, without the toasting break at the end.]  (AMG)\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/VLPuVl1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/VLPuVl1.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n01.
