When you master one exercise, you move on to the next, and so on. Because the later exercises build on the earlier ones, they are sometimes called the &quot;ten steps&quot;. When you reach the tenth exercise, you will be just about as strong as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s possible for a human being to be in that movement. For this reason, the tenth exercise in any chain is called the &quot;Master Step&quot;. How this all works will be crystal clear if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve picked up a copy of the Convict Conditioning bodyweight book.\nPrison-style midsection trainingÃ¢â‚¬â€\nfor an all show AND all go physique\n \n\nWhen convicts train their waists, they want real, noticeable resultsÃ¢â‚¬â€and by &quot;results&quot; we donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean that they want cute, tight little defined abs. We mean that they want thick, strong, muscular midsections. They want functionally powerful abs and hips they can use for heavy lifting, kicking, and brawling. They want guts so strong from their training that it actually hurts an attacker to punch them in the belly. Prison abs arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t about all show, no goÃ¢â‚¬â€a prison-built physique has to be all show and all go. Those guys donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just want six-packsÃ¢â‚¬â€they want six-packs from Hell.\n\nAnd, for the first time, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to show you how these guys get what they want. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not going to be using sissy machines or easy isolation exercisesÃ¢â‚¬â€weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going straight for the old school secret weapon for gut training; progressive leg raises.\n\nIf you want a six-pack from Hell, the first thing you need to do is focus your efforts. If a weightlifter wanted a very thick, powerful chest in a hurry, he wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t spread his efforts out over a dozen exercises and perform them gently all day long. NoÃ¢â‚¬â€heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d pick just one exercise, probably the bench press, and just focus on getting stronger and stronger on that lift until he was monstrously strong. When he reached this level, and his pecs were thick slabs of meat, only then would he maybe begin sculpting them with minor exercises and higher reps.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no different if you want a mind-blowing midsection. Just pick one exercise that hits all the muscles in the midsectionÃ¢â‚¬â€the hip flexors, the abs, the intercostals, the obliquesÃ¢â‚¬â€then blast it.\n\nAnd the one exercise weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to discover is the best midsection exercise known to man, and the most popular amongst soldiers, warriors, martial artists and prison athletes since men started working outÃ¢â‚¬â€the leg raise.\n\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll discover ten different leg raise movements, each one a little harder than the last. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to get the most out of each of these techniques, each of these ten steps, before moving up to the next step. By the time you get through all ten steps and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re working with the final Master Step of the leg raise series, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have a solid, athletic, stomach made of steel, as well as powerful hips and a ribcage armoured with dense muscle. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have abs that wouldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve made Bruce Lee take notice!\nThe Ten Commandments You Must Obey to\nEarn a Real Monster of an Athletic Core\n \n\nPaul Wade gives you ten key points, the &quot;Ten Commandments&quot; of leg raises, that will take your prison-style core training from just &quot;okay&quot; to absolutely phenomenal. We want the results to be so effective that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll literally shock you. This kind of accelerated progress can be achieved, but if you want to achieve it you better listen carefully to these ten key pointers youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll discover with the DVD.\n\nBodyweight mastery is a lot like high-level martial arts. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s more about principles than individual techniques. Really study and absorb these principles, and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be on your way to a six-pack from Hell in no time.\n\nThe hanging straight leg raise, performed strictly and for reps, is the Gold Standard of abdominal strength techniques. Once youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re at the level where you can throw out sets of twenty to thirty rock solid reps of this exercise, your abs will be thick and strong, but more importantly, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be functionalÃ¢â‚¬â€not just a pretty six-pack, but a real monster of an athletic core, which is capable of developing high levels of force.\n\nHanging will work your serratus and intercostals, making these muscles stand out like fingers, and your obliques and flank muscles will be tight and strong from holding your hips in place. Your lumbar spine will achieve a gymnastic level of flexibility, like fluid steel, and your chances of back pain will be greatly reduced.\n\nThe bottom line: If you want to be stronger and more athletic than the next guy, you need the edge that straight leg raises can give you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c27543d747e163139f077cc7a087014f1b45963","amp;dn":"Convict.Conditioning.Volume.3.Six.Pack+Dvdrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c27543d747e163139f077cc7a087014f1b45963","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,39,84,61,116,126,22,49,57,240,119,204,122,8,112,20,241,180,89,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
