In the following whirlwind that ensued (and prepare for quite the run-on sentence): the band played self booked tours; signed to drive thru records; released a self-titled EP (which went on to sell 400,000 copies, even after being available free for months); toured with the All American Rejects, Panic at the Disco, Motion City Soundtrack and more; and finally released their debut full length, Zombies! Aliens! Vampires! Dinosaurs! (which sold over 500,000 copies and over 1,000,000 copies of the single, &quot;Here (In Your Arms)&quot;).\n\nSince then the band has been determined to remain self-made men. They furnished Forrest's home garage into a very productive recording studio, created and maintained an online merch store from a spare bedroom, kept touring relentlessly while peppering in ep releases to culminate to the release of their self-funded grand opus, &quot;Would It Kill You?&quot;. Much of the record is about letting go, accepting and eventually celebrating the weirdness of life. Would it kill you to get married and live an awesome life together (no, clearly it'd be awesome [Forrest got married june 25th)? Would it kill you to play a show with LL Cool J (no, it'd probably be hilarious [Hellogoodbye played with ladies love cool james at the coca cola fest)? Would it kill you to work hard and be nice? (that's what the band is trying to do).\n\n1. (00:02:56) Hellogoodbye - Finding Something To Do\n2. (00:03:00) Hellogoodbye - Getting Old\n3. (00:02:35) Hellogoodbye - When We First Met\n4.
