It also provided popular initial exposure for several actors who would eventually become well known, such as Derek Jacobi, SiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢n Phillips, Patrick Stewart, John Rhys-Davies and John Hurt.\n\nI, Claudius follows the history of Rome, narrated by the elderly Claudius, from the death of Marcellus in the first episode to Claudius's own death in the last. The series opens with Augustus, the emperor of Rome, attempting to find an heir, and his wife Livia's plots to have her own son become emperor. \n\nThis plotting and double-crossing continue for many years, through the conspiracy of Sejanus, the rule of the emperor Caligula, and eventually, Claudius's own rule.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c869def1e19c876e0c193197edefd9a73689144","amp;dn":"Robert+Graves+-+I%2C+Claudius++%28BBC+-+All+Episodes%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c869def1e19c876e0c193197edefd9a73689144","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,134,157,239,30,25,200,118,224,193,147,25,126,222,253,154,115,104,145,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
