As you begin to think about all the things in your life you are grateful for, you will be amazed at the never ending thoughts that come back to you of more things to be grateful for. You have to make a start, and then the law of attraction will receive those grateful thoughts and give you more just like them.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nRhonda Byrne (born 12 March 1951) is an Australian television writer and producer, best known for her New Thought books The Secret (based on a film she produced of the same name) and its sequel The Power.
