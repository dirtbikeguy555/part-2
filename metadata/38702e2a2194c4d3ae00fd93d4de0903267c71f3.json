You can check out all the new features here, but before doing that lets take a look at all the known bugs.\n\nOne that we were warned about beforehand is EdgeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tendency to crash on systems using AMD graphics, hence this build being available only to the Fast Ring for now. HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the full list:\n\nSee my note above regarding the issue on PCs with AMD GPUs and frequent crashes in Microsoft Edge.\n\nUpgrading to this build on certain PCs may fail and roll back to the previously installed build with error 0x80070057 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 0x20007. This is a bug where too many device INFs are being migrated and hitting an internal limit. Possible workaround is to use Disk Cleanup to clean up system files and choose Device driver packages, Previous Windows installations and Temporary Windows installation files. You may also need to remove unnecessary peripherals and remove them from Device Manager and trying the upgrade again.\n\nIn this build there is a bug that may cause issues with Cortana speech. If you are experiencing problems with speech recognition, or are getting errors when trying to speak to Cortana, please visit the Windows Insider Program forumfor assistance in recovering from this bug.\nAs you can see, despite efforts to offer fixes and more stability some issues have still creeped up. Of course, this was to be expected as Windows 10 is still pre-release software. If you feel you need to stay away for a bit longer donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t worry as, we have full coverage on the main page to make sure you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t miss anything.\n\nWindows 10 build 10122 is now available to insiders subscribed to the Fast ring, but with it come a number of new bugs and issues.\n\nDespite being a significant jump from the previous version of 10074, the new 10122 version, doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have any revolutionary or unexpected new features, as the company is focusing on bug fixing and stabilizing code, ahead of the full release later this summer.
