It was designed to be more than a reference manual that provides an alphabetical listing of skin conditions-because the diagnosis isn't always straightforward and differential diagnoses must be consider. This text can help advance practice clinicians and physicians develop essential dermatology competency through the fundamental knowledge of lesion morphology which can direct them to an accurate diagnosis. Chapters are organized by morphology and accompanied by more than 600 color photos to aid in easier diagnosis of common skin diseases, and early recognition of &quot;high risk&quot; conditions that require prompt management. Content focuses on pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical presentations, diagnostics, differential diagnoses, management, complications, follow-up, patient education, referral and consultation. Special considerations address the unique needs of specific patient populations such as immunosuppression and pregnancy. And very importantly, new ICD-10 codes required by CMS for use October 2015 are included to help clinicians capture appropriate billing codes to maximize reimbursement","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d3ee558fb9acc1bbbf604046a916b86d461ba27","amp;dn":"Dermatology+for+Advanced+Practice+Clinicians+%5BPDF%5D%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d3ee558fb9acc1bbbf604046a916b86d461ba27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,62,229,88,251,154,204,27,187,246,4,4,106,145,107,134,212,97,186,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
