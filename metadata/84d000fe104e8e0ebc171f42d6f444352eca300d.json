It marks a shift in the sound from Chicago house, which they were previously known for, to disco, post-disco and synthpop-inspired house. The album provided itself as a soundtrack to the anime film Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem, which was a collaboration between the creators of the album, Leiji Matsumoto, and Toei Animation. All of the music videos for the tracks on the album are segments of the film. Interstella 5555 follows a story of a kidnapped extraterrestrial band. Discovery is recognized as a concept album in reviews by New Musical Express and Spin magazines. Early versions of the album included a &quot;Daft Club&quot; membership card. The card included a code which granted access to an online music service, which featured tracks later released on the album of the same name and Alive 1997.\n\t\nAmazon.com's Best of 2001 Review By Matthew Cooke - The French twosome behind Daft Punk, Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel De Homem-Christo, get away with an awful lot. They go around impersonating aliens and robots in their interviews, they put records out only once every three years, and they make music that evokes a million other artists--while not really sounding like any of them. The keyboard noodlings of Jean-Michel Jarre are in there somewhere, along with the otherworldly imagery and giant hooks of '70s rock icons like Boston or even Electric Light Orchestra. There are dashes of 1999-era Prince and oodles of new wave and disco cheese, from Harold Faltermeyer and Gary Numan to the Bee Gees, all set off with efficient house beats. So how have they managed to position themselves as electronic music's next great crossover artists? On Discovery, the follow-up to the 1998 worldwide smash Homework, the answer is obvious: they have no shame, and they know how to make us dance. Starting off with the irresistibly hummable &quot;One More Time,&quot; the record blows through a head-spinning array of styles and samples, creating a pop-culture stew of funky loops and dance-floor anthems. &quot;Aerodynamic&quot; eschews breakbeats for an Yngwie Malmsteen-ish guitar interlude that somehow ends up meshing in a crazy blend of stomping bass lines and hyped-up harmonics. &quot;Digital Love&quot; starts off silly and gets sillier, but the monosyllabic lyrics lull the senses just right, allowing the song's summery groove to grab hold with authority. &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot; is a resounding standout amidst the retro/Vocoder deluge that transpired after Cher's Believe turned the kitchy disco device into a worldwide pop music trend, spinning a clever groove around an ever-escalating string of computerized seduction. Everywhere on the record, gigantic beats are dropped with pinpoint precision, giving songs a momentum that transforms repetitive melodies into sudden revelations. The record's only misstep, the aptly named &quot;Short Circuit&quot; utilizes a keyboard riff that is nails-on-a-chalkboard awful, but it can't keep this from being one of the best records of 2001.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] One More Time\n[02] Aerodynamic\n[03] Digital Love\n[04] Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\n[05] Crescendolls\n[06] Nightvision\n[07] Superheroes\n[08] High Life\n[09] Something About Us\n[10] Voyager\n[11] Veridis Quo\n[12] Short Circuit\n[13] Face To Face\n[14] Too Long\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 01h:00m:50s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 144mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes v8.1.1.10  MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; Quicktime Mpeg N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi &amp; 200 dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Electronica Dance\nRelease Date\t&gt; 13 March 2001\nRecord Company\t&gt; Virgin Records\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; http://www.daftpunk.com\n\t&gt;\t&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daft_Punk \n\t&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/d/daftpunk.html \n\t&gt;\n\t&gt; http://www.bebo.com/daftpunk \n\t&gt; http://www.ilike.com/artist/Daft+Punk \n\t&gt;\n\t&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/daftpunk \n\t&gt;\t&gt;\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84d000fe104e8e0ebc171f42d6f444352eca300d","amp;dn":"%5B2001%5D+Discovery+-+Daft+Punk+144mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84d000fe104e8e0ebc171f42d6f444352eca300d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,208,0,254,16,78,142,14,188,23,31,66,214,244,68,53,46,202,48,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
