The original graphics &amp; liner notes look great and the CD, itself, is painted to look like a long playing vinyl disc of the post WW2 years.\n\nThen there are the songs, the interpretations, the arrangements. All impeccable. Sure, I could do without hearing &quot;Nancy With the Laughing Face&quot; or &quot;The House I Live In&quot; ever again but Sinatra is at his torchiest in &quot;I'm a Fool To Want You,&quot; his most tender in &quot;I've Got A Crush On You,&quot; his coolest in &quot;Body and Soul&quot; and his swingingest in &quot;Sweet Lorraine.&quot; And if I've read the enclosed booklet correctly, that song has Nat King Cole on piano and Buddy Rich on drums!!!!!!!\n\nRecorded from 1944 to 1952,the sound is remastered monaural and it is fine.
