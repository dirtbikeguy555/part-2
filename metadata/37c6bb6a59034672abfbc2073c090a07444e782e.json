On the night he and his girlfriend, Caroline, become engaged, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s told to pick up Charlie Wax at Orly. Charlie is an unorthodox government employee Ã¢â‚¬â€œ large, bald and bearded, foul-mouthed and eccentric. Charlie immediately takes James on a wild ride of murder and mayhem, through ethnic enclaves. As bodies pile up, the purpose remains opaque to James. Caroline, unhappy that James has been out of touch for a day, tells him to bring Charlie for dinner. Charlie can be charming Ã¢â‚¬â€œ where will it lead? Does the chess-playing James have what it takes?\n\nInfo: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1179034/\nRelease Date: 5 February 2010 (USA)\nGenre: Action | Crime | Thriller\nStars: John Travolta, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Kasia Smutniak\nQuality: BluRay 720p\nEncoder: FatNanda@Ganool\nSource: 720p Bluray x264-CBGB\nSize: 650MB ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37c6bb6a59034672abfbc2073c090a07444e782e","amp;dn":"From+Paris+with+Love+%282010%29+BluRay+720p+650MB+Ganool","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37c6bb6a59034672abfbc2073c090a07444e782e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,198,187,106,89,3,70,114,171,251,194,7,60,9,10,7,68,78,120,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
