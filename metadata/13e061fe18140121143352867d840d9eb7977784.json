We'll explore everything from how to set up animation preferences and create key frames, to learning how animation can be modified from 3ds Max's Trackbar and Curve Editor.\nWe'll learn how to animate objects along a path, how to work non-destructively with animation layers, and how to animate with the Link Constraint. We'll even learn how to work with Populate, 3ds Max's new crowd simulation tool.\nBy the end of the training, you'll be equipped with the understanding you need to animate comfortably inside of 3ds Max.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13e061fe18140121143352867d840d9eb7977784","amp;dn":"Digital+Tutors+-+Introduction+to+Animation+in+3ds+Max","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13e061fe18140121143352867d840d9eb7977784","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,224,97,254,24,20,1,33,20,51,82,134,125,132,13,158,183,151,119,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
