Yet the most powerful, persuasive communication has a human element...often delivered simply and personally through the telling of stories.\n\nThis book shows readers how to use personal stories to get their ideas across and create meaningful connections between themselves and their audience. Moving beyond the usual speech-openers or ice-breakers, the book gives readers a process for finding, developing, and using their own stories, including how to:\n\n* gain people's trust\n* use six different kinds of stories\n* shift from everyday thinking into story thinking\n* help shape group decisions and actions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12854bb909e8b35fec3b2b9842c4da553fa63233","amp;dn":"Whoever+Tells+the+Best+Story+Wins%3A+How+to+Use+Your+Own+Stories","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12854bb909e8b35fec3b2b9842c4da553fa63233","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,133,75,185,9,232,179,95,236,59,43,152,66,196,218,85,63,166,50,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
