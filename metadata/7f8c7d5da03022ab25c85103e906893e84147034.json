The ancient art of tattooing is a tradition we carry on to this day. While the past 10 years have seen no shortage of books about tattoos and tattooing, most are best described as Ã¢â‚¬Å“idea books.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Until now, none have profiled the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most renowned artists across a variety of styles. This book explores this most basic form of self-expression by showcasing the studios and work of 18 of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s top tattoo artists, including SuluÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ape Angela (San Diego), Aaron Bell (Seattle), Bugs (Los Angeles), Mo Cappoletta (London), Madame Chan (Brussels), Daniel DiMattia (Liege), Durga (Jakarta), Gakkin (Kyoto), Horiryu (Costa Mesa), Henning Jorgensen (Copenhagen), Rory Keating (San Diego), Brent McCowan (Carinthia), Maneko (Brasilia), Keone Nunes (Oahu), Noon (New York/London/Berlin), Sua SuluÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ape Petelo (Sydney), Te Rangitu (Waipapa), and Simon &amp; Eddie (Hartama). Each chapter profiles the artist in the context of where he or she fits into the overall tradition of tattooing, while the photos showcase not only the art but also the artists and their workspaces.\n\nAbout the Author\nDale Rio is an artist, photographer, and writer currently living in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
