The book addresses these paradoxes using a new theory of infinity, which entails that an infinite series is uncompletable when it requires something to possess an infinite intensive magnitude. Along the way, the author addresses the nature of numbers, sets, geometric points, and related matters.\r\n\r\nThe book addresses the need for a theory of infinity, and reviews both old and new theories of infinity. It discusses the purposes of studying infinity and the troubles with traditional approaches to the problem, and concludes by offering a solution to some existing paradoxes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e4fed9a38db1955c05b60e99bf262a2de069871","amp;dn":"Approaching+Infinity","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e4fed9a38db1955c05b60e99bf262a2de069871","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,79,237,154,56,219,25,85,192,91,96,233,155,242,98,162,222,6,152,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
