Legacy Piano series marks the next evolution in piano sampling and first virtual piano series to ever have round robin (repetition samples) on both sustains and staccato, which means you get a more varied, fluent and expressive piano.\n\nWe are launching our Legacy series with the release of one of the most precious and sought after pianos in the history of pianos, namely a specific series of ivory covered Steinway grand that were produced in Germany in 1928. This particular series and era is known to be one of the best and the building quality still stands unmatched Ã¢â‚¬â€œ even the strings are still original from 1928. It is the perfect piano for soundtrack composers, songwriters and people looking for an advanced emotional and resonant piano. In addition the instrument was recorded with two sets of microphones (close/internal) and (ambient/player), so users can adjust the sound to their liking ranging from recordings inside the piano to a natural player perspective.\n\n=======[ Instruction ]===============================================================\n\nFor Kontakt 5.3 (and above)\n\n--- [ METHOD I ] ---\n\n- Open Kontakt 5.3 (and above)\n- Go to File tab\n- Browse for the torrent folder\n- Drag n Drop the NKI files into the Right Panel to use.\n\n--- [ METHOD II ] ---\n\n- Go to Library tab\n- Click Add Library\n- Browse for the library folder's location\n- Click Ok/Yes\n- Accept or Yes when asked\n\n=======[ Extra ]=====================================================================\n\nI DO NOT OWN THIS PRODUCT - IF YOU ENJOY IT, PLEASE CONSIDER BUYING TO SUPPORT OWNER!\n\n=======[ Greets ]====================================================================\n\nGreeting to awesome uploaders:\n\n- deepstatus\n- datsn1pah\n- imafaggot","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a325d0f126dfc13d1a419b3ca2c74e1ecda06751","amp;dn":"8Dio+-+Legacy+1928+Steinway+Piano+%5BKontakt%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a325d0f126dfc13d1a419b3ca2c74e1ecda06751","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,37,208,241,38,223,193,61,26,65,155,60,162,199,78,30,205,160,103,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
