Translated and with an Afterword by David Horrocks.\n\nISBN: 978-0141182896 | 256 pages | ePUB + MOBI\n\n\nHERMANN HESSE (1877-1962) was a German poet and novelist who received the 1946 Nobel Prize in Literature.  His work explores an individual's search for authenticity, self-knowledge and spirituality.\n\nNow in a new translation by David Horrocks, STEPPENWOLF (1927) is a modernist work of profound wisdom that continues to enthral readers with its subtle blend of Eastern mysticism and Western culture.  Combining autobiographical and psychoanalytic elements, it reflects a profound crisis in Hesse's spiritual world during the 1920s.\n\nAt first sight Harry Haller seems a respectable, educated man.  In reality he is the Steppenwolf: wild, strange, alienated from society and repulsed by the modern age.  But as he is drawn into a series of dreamlike and sometimes savage encounters -- accompanied by, among others, Mozart, Goethe and the bewitching Hermione -- the misanthropic Haller discovers a higher truth, and the possibility of happiness.  This blistering portrayal of a man who feels himself to be half-human and half-wolf was the bible of the 1960s counterculture, capturing the mood of a disaffected generation, and remains a haunting story of estrangement and redemption.\n\nNOTE: For the translation by Basil Creighton, updated by Joseph Mileck, see: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9512098/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9512098/&lt;/a&gt; \n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nNOTE: I can be contacted via the SuprBay forum with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc.:\n                   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like these books and want others to have access to them, please consider seeding for as long as you can.
