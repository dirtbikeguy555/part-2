Suuronen, Marc Ruel (Springer, 2015).pdf\r\n\r\nThis book offers readers a comprehensive biomaterials-based approach to achieving clinically successful, functionally integrated vasculogenesis and myogenesis in the heart. Coverage is multidisciplinary, including the role of extracellular matrices in cardiac development, whole-heart tissue engineering, imaging the mechanisms and effects of biomaterial-based cardiac regeneration, and autologous bioengineered heart valves. Bringing current knowledge together into a single volume, this book provides a compendium to students and new researchers in the field and constitutes a platform to allow for future developments and collaborative approaches in biomaterials-based regenerative medicine, even beyond cardiac applications","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2765c29993a5e1c59ca2b7e557f6b8c397037409","amp;dn":"Biomaterials+for+Cardiac+Regeneration","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2765c29993a5e1c59ca2b7e557f6b8c397037409","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,101,194,153,147,165,225,197,156,162,183,229,87,246,184,195,151,3,116,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
