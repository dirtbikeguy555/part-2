Their mix of hard rock; folk melodies; blues licks; surreal, impossibly dense lyrics; and overall profundity defied easy analysis, but that didn't dissuade fans from giving them 11 gold and five platinum albums. At the same time, critics rarely took them seriously, and they were off the cutting edge of popular music since the end of the 1970s. But no record store in the country would want to be without multiple copies of each of their most popular albums (Benefit, Aqualung, Thick as a Brick, Living in the Past), or their various best-of compilations, and few would knowingly ignore their newest releases. Of their contemporaries, only Yes could claim a similar degree of success, and Yes endured several major shifts in sound and membership in reaching the 1990s, while Tull remained remarkably stable over the same period. As co-founded and led by wildman-flautist-guitarist-singer-songwriter Ian Anderson, the group carved a place all its own in popular music.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.A Song For Jeffrey\n02.Beggar's Farm\n03.A Christmas Song\n04.A New Day Yesterday\n05.BourÃƒÂ©e\n06.Nothing Is Easy\n07.Living In The Past\n08.To Cry You A Song\n09.Teacher\n10.Sweet Dream\n11.Cross-Eyed Mary\n12.Mother Goose\n13.Aqualung\n14.Locomotive Breath\n15.Life Is A Long Song\n16.Thick As A Brick (Extract)\n17.A Passion Play (Extract)\n19.Bungle In The Jungle\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.Minstrel In The Gallery\n02.Too Old To Rock 'N' Roll, Too Young To Die\n03.Songs From The Wood\n04.Jack-In-The-Green\n05.The Whistler\n06.Heavy Horses\n07.Dun Ringill\n08.Fylingdale Flyer\n09.Jack-A-Lynn\n10.Pussy Willow\n11.Broadsword\n12.Under Wraps II\n13.Steel Monkey\n14.Farm On The Freeway\n15.Jump Start\n16.Kissing Willie\n17.This Is Not Love\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          ****You Don't Have To Thank Me.
