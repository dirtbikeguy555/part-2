The inclusion of worked problems with solutions help you to learn and further problems then allow you to test and confirm you have fully understood each subject. In total the book contains 800 worked problems, 1000 further problems and 14 revision tests with answers online.\n\nThis an ideal text for foundation and undergraduate degree students and those on upper level vocational engineering courses, in particular electrical and mechanical. It provides a sound understanding of the knowledge required by technicians in fields such as electrical engineering, electronics and telecommunications.\n\nThis edition has been updated with developments in key areas such as semiconductors, transistors, and fuel cells, along with brand new material on ABCD parameters and FourierÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Analysis. It is supported by a companion website that contains solutions to the 1000 questions in the practice exercises, formulae to help students answer the questions and information about the famous mathematicians and scientists mentioned in the book. Lecturers also have access to full solutions and the marking scheme for the 14 revision tests, lesson plans and illustrations from the book","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86916dbac084a93fe562a2ab3f8bc3ffd32c66c3","amp;dn":"Electrical+Circuit+Theory+%26amp%3B+Technology+-+5th+Edition+-+John+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86916dbac084a93fe562a2ab3f8bc3ffd32c66c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,145,109,186,192,132,169,63,229,98,162,171,63,139,195,255,211,44,102,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
