A dynamic positioning allows you to apply local corrections.\r\nTo get the results you want, you will have to watch tutorials and not be afraid to try all of the settings. This is a tool for the advanced artist.\r\nThis is a very versatile program which takes time to understand completely due to the many options and functions it provides.\r\nMy goal is not to discourage you even before the purchase of VWD, I want to warn you that you will not be able to realize complex simulations without a consequent personal work.\r\nI strongly advise you to try the demo version that will allow you to create the same simulations than the full version. Its only limitation is the inability to export them into Poser. \r\nThis test will allow you to estimate the difficulties and your desire to overcome them.\r\nI will bring you all the help I can. There is already a community of people who have acquired expertise in VWD and may also help you.\r\nSome video tutorials exist in the freestuffs that provide considerable help to both novice and experienced users.\r\nI want myself to create tutorials showing how works each simulation I will publish on Youtube. Starting with the ones already published.\r\nThe program evolves every day and bugs that are regularly corrected.\r\nIt is important to know that VWD will allow you to make relive many products that you have abandoned and to which you no longer think.\r\n\r\nDAZ Studio Bridge:\r\nAdd the power of true dynamic cloth to Daz Studio. Give a new life to your content library.\r\nThis product allows you to use VWD Cloth and hair from Daz Studio\r\n\r\nProduct Page: \nhttps://www.renderosity.com/mod/bcs/?ViewProduct=114645\r\n\r\nCommunity Link:  \nhttps://pirates-forum.org/Forum-DAZ3D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b8c17bc5509d9ccedea19b5451f05547f0aff93","amp;dn":"DAZ3D+Poser+-+VWD+Cloth+and+Hair","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b8c17bc5509d9ccedea19b5451f05547f0aff93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,140,23,188,85,9,217,204,237,234,25,181,69,31,5,84,127,10,255,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
