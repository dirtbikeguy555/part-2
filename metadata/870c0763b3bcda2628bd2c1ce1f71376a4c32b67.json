In this, the first of two volumes chronologically collecting all his published adult short stories, we see how Dahl began by using his experiences in the war to write fiction but quickly turned to his powerful and dark imagination to pen some of the most unsettling and disquieting tales ever written.\n\nIn 27 stories, written between 1944 and 1953, we encounter such classic tales as 'Man from the South', featuring a wager with appalling consequences; 'Lamb to the Slaughter', in which a wife murders her husband yet has a novel idea for throwing the police off the scent; and in 'The Sound Machine', the horrific truth about plants is revealed.\n\nEnter the sinister, twisted world of Roald Dahl: whether you're young or old, you'll never want to leave.\n\n'Roald Dahl is one of the few writers I know whose work can accurately be described as addictive' Irish Times\n\n'The great magician' Spectator\n\nLook out for Volume Two, introduced by Anthony Horowitz\n\nRoald Dahl, the brilliant and worldwide acclaimed author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach, Matilda, and many more classics for children, also wrote scores of short stories for adults. These delightfully disturbing tales have often been filmed and were most recently the inspiration for the West End play, Roald Dahl's Twisted Tales by Jeremy Dyson. Roald Dahl's stories continue to make readers shiver today.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:870c0763b3bcda2628bd2c1ce1f71376a4c32b67","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Short+Stories+-+Vol+1+-+Roald+Dahl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"870c0763b3bcda2628bd2c1ce1f71376a4c32b67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,12,7,99,179,188,218,38,40,189,44,28,225,247,19,118,164,195,43,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
