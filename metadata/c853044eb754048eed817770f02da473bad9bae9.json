The topics address numerous aspects of medicine, demonstrating the current conceptual status of biomarkers as clinical tools and as surrogate endpoints in clinical research.\r\nThe use of biomarkers in basic and clinical research has become routine in many areas of medicine. They are accepted as molecular signatures that have been well characterized and repeatedly shown to be capable of predicting relevant disease states or clinical outcomes.\r\nIn Role of Biomarkers in Medicine, expert researchers in their individual field have reviewed many biomarkers or potential biomarkers in various types of diseases.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nPreface\r\n1 Cancer Biomarkers\r\n2 Dynamics of Cancer-Related Proteins in Patients with Bladder Cancer\r\n3 Emerging Biomarkers and Clinical Implications in Endometrial Carcinoma\r\n4 Oxidative Stress Biomarkers for Diabetic Retinopathy and Medical Management Affecting Oxidative Stress\r\n5 Novel Biomarkers to Understand Cardiovascular Complications in Diabetes\r\n6 Biomarkers, Obesity, and Cardiovascular Diseases\r\n7 High-Mobility Group Box-1 Protein a Potential Inflammatory Biomarker in Diabetic Retinopathy\r\n8 Potential Biomarkers for Physical Exercise-Induced Brain Health\r\n9 Biomarkers in Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury\r\n10 Biomarkers-Directed Strategies to Treat Autism\r\n11 Biomarkers in Rare Genetic Diseases \r\n \nhttps://s4.postimg.io/utggy88n1/Role_of_Biomarkers_in_Medicine.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c853044eb754048eed817770f02da473bad9bae9","amp;dn":"Role+of+Biomarkers+in+Medicine+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c853044eb754048eed817770f02da473bad9bae9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,83,4,78,183,84,4,142,237,129,119,112,240,45,164,115,186,217,186,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
