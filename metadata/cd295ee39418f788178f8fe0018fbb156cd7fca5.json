VINE VOICE\nSay what you will about the movie (I'm not a fan), but if you're an &quot;arena rock&quot; fan it's hard to beat the soundtrack to Days of Thunder. Obviously Guns n' Roses' take on Bob Dylan's &quot;Knockin' On Heaven's Door&quot; was the major hit from this soundtrack, but that also appeared on their Use Your Illusion II album, albeit as a slightly different version. There are still plenty of good tracks here that you won't find elsewhere, most notably Whitesnake frontman David Coverdale's &quot;The Last Note of Freedom&quot;. There are also solid AOR entries by John Waite, Joan Jett and - believe it or not - Chicago. Even the contributions from Tina Turner, Cher and Elton John are better than I expected.\n\nDespite its 1990 release date, Days of Thunder is a great 80's rock soundtrack that fits right in with the soundtracks for Navy Seals: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead, Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989 Film) and Over the Top.\n\nOh, and what's with all the 1-star reviews from people who were expecting the film's score? The track listing makes it perfectly clear what's on this disc.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd295ee39418f788178f8fe0018fbb156cd7fca5","amp;dn":"Days+Of+Thunder+-+Music+From+The+Motion+Picture+Soundtrack+320cb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd295ee39418f788178f8fe0018fbb156cd7fca5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,41,94,227,148,24,247,136,23,143,143,224,1,143,187,21,108,215,252,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
