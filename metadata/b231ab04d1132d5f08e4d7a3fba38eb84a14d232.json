Using the Arduino platform we will start by making simple projects and gradually build it all together until we have created a complete robot. You will not need to learn anything massively complicated or use any unfamiliar equipment. We have also included: inspiration for those after more advanced projects, a whole host of hints and tips and a large troubleshooting section, in case you need it. Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b231ab04d1132d5f08e4d7a3fba38eb84a14d232","amp;dn":"How+to+Build+a+Robot+-+2014++UK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b231ab04d1132d5f08e4d7a3fba38eb84a14d232","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,49,171,4,209,19,45,95,8,228,215,163,251,163,142,184,74,20,210,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
