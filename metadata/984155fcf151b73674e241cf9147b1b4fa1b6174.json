Trumpeter Chet Baker is heard shortly before he joined Gerry MulliganÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s quartet participating on a jam session with altos Charlie Parker and Sonny Criss. They play lengthy versions of four songs and there are plenty of heated moments on this bop set. - Allmusic.com \n\n\nThis jazz collector's gem captures a set by two tragic, self-destructive yet historically immortal giants at a club in Inglewood, CA, June 16 1952.  As a bonus, the pair are joined by the late Sonny Criss, one of the best and most under - recognized Parker - influenced alto players.  Parker was at this time an established musician, and Baker was just out of the Army, on his way up.  The concert, which is excellently recorded with sharp, crisp detail, gives everyone a chance to stretch out beyond the confines of a recording studio. \n\nEveryone here sounds inspired, with little wandering and no wasted notes.  Baker sounds like he's been listening to a lot of Dizzy &amp; Miles, and while his style hadn't yet fully formed, he more than keeps up with his company.  Parker and Criss play with rich-as-fudge, mercurial, blues-drenched tones.  If you're a Parker fan, you should own this release.  If you're a Baker fan, and you want a look at his early years, dig in.  If you love live jazz (bop/mainstream style) albums, this is one of the better ones. \n\nNote: \nThis record was made in the Trade Winds Club in Inglewood, California, on 16 June, 1952.  It was re-issued in 1992 under the label Jazz Door (JD 1209).  The sound quality is not ideal.  There is apparently a warning on the original disk: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHistoric Recording: please mind recording date when judging the sound qualityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. \n\nPersonnel: \nCharlie Parker (alto saxophone) \nChet Baker (trumpet) \nSonny Criss (alto saxophone) \nAl Haig (piano) \nHarry Babasin (double bass) \nLarance Marable (drums) \n\nBird &amp; Chet - Inglewood Jam: Live At The Trade Winds Tracks: \n01  The Squirrel (Dameron) 15:00 \n02  Irresistable You (DePaul, Raye) 6:21 \n03  Indiana (Donna Lee) (Hanley, MacDonald, Parker) 11:25 \n04  Lisa (Gershwin, Gershwin) 10:13","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:984155fcf151b73674e241cf9147b1b4fa1b6174","amp;dn":"Charlie+Parker+%26+Chet+Baker+-+Bird+%26+Chet+%281952%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"984155fcf151b73674e241cf9147b1b4fa1b6174","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,65,85,252,241,81,183,54,116,226,65,207,145,71,177,180,250,27,97,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
