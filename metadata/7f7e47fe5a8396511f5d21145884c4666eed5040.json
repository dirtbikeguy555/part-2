In each level, your boss gives you a job. Automate it by programming your little office worker. If you succeed, you'll be promoted up to the next level for another year of work in the vast office building. Congratulations!\r\nDon't worry if you've never programmed before - programming is just puzzle solving. If you strip away all the 1's and 0's and scary squiggly brackets, programming is simple, logical, beautiful, and something that anyone can understand and have fun with! Are you already an expert? There will be extra challenges for you.\r\nHave fun! Management is watching.\r\nLearn to program inside a giant computer made of humans. You'll be taught everything you need to know.\r\nAlready an expert? Each level comes with Optimization Challenges - difficult (and optional) challenges that test how well your solution optimizes for program size and execution speed.\r\nFrom the creators of Little Inferno and World of Goo.\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: XP or later\r\nProcessor: 1.5Ghz CPU \r\nMemory: 1 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: graphics card that supports Shader Model 2.0 or greater \r\nDirectX: Version 9.0c \r\nHard Drive: 200 MB available space","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f7e47fe5a8396511f5d21145884c4666eed5040","amp;dn":"Human+Resource+Machine+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f7e47fe5a8396511f5d21145884c4666eed5040","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,126,71,254,90,131,150,81,31,93,33,20,88,132,196,102,110,237,80,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
