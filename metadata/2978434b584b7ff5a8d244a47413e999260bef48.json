The disc is packed solid with sonic evidence of Coltrane's innate leadership abilities. He not only addresses the tunes at hand, but also simultaneously reinvents himself as a multifaceted interpreter of both hard bop as well as sensitive balladry -- touching upon all forms in between. The personnel on Blue Train is arguably as impressive as what they're playing. Joining Coltrane (tenor sax) are Lee Morgan (trumpet), Curtis Fuller (trombone), Kenny Drew (piano), Paul Chambers (bass), and Philly Joe Jones (drums). The triple horn arrangements incorporate an additional sonic density that remains a trademark unique to both this band and album.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2978434b584b7ff5a8d244a47413e999260bef48","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+-+Blue+Train+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+180g+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2978434b584b7ff5a8d244a47413e999260bef48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,120,67,75,88,75,127,245,168,210,68,164,116,19,233,153,38,11,239,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
