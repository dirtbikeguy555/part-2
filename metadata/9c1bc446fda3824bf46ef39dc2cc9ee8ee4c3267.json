Mr. Raymond explains to him that he has a time-twin, to whom he's relocated in space and time whenever one of them is in trouble. So he has to help his twin, biplane pilot Biggles, in his attempt to destroy a German super weapon, that could win their war. Of course it's hard for Jim to explain his sudden disappearances to his fiance, Debbie. \n \n SCREEN SHOTS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c1bc446fda3824bf46ef39dc2cc9ee8ee4c3267","amp;dn":"Biggles%3A+Adventures+in+Time+%281986%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c1bc446fda3824bf46ef39dc2cc9ee8ee4c3267","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,27,196,70,253,163,130,75,244,110,243,157,194,204,158,232,238,76,50,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
