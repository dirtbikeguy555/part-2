By 1985 he was one of the six original members of the group Commissioned, participating in 10 of the group's 12 albums.\n\nAfter his stint with Commissioned ended, he regained fame in the gospel community after selling millions of albums with his musical group Radical For Christ.\n\nIn 2002 Hammond returned to the group Commissioned to produce the Commissioned Reunion Live album.\n\nHammond produced Make Me Like The Moon, a stirring gospel ballad co-written by Chante Moore and Kenny Lattimore for their 2006 double-CD of gospel and R&amp;B love songs entitled Uncovered/Covered.
