(unlike  the current  trend) a  highly advanced,  but  ?\n         ?  easy to use algorithmic reverb, so no convolution  is  ?\n         ?  involved.                                              ?\n         ?                                                         ?\n         ?  why no convolution?                                    ?\n         ?                                                         ?\n         ?  several issues made us  believe that there is  a need  ?\n         ?  for algorithmic reverbs, such as having full  control  ?\n         ?  not only  over a  few, but  all important  parameters  ?\n         ?  which are needed to design a room to perfect results.  ?\n         ?                                                         ?\n         ?  so what was the aim?                                   ?\n         ?                                                         ?\n         ?  next to  the sound  of a  good reverb,  wich was  our  ?\n         ?  highest  priority  of  course,  it  is  mostly   very  ?\n         ?  important to  edit the  room/reverb to  suit into the  ?\n         ?  given situation.  even the  smoothest reverb  tail is  ?\n         ?  not much of use if it doesnÃ‚Âªt fit into the mix. every  ?\n         ?  master has different requests,  so the reverb has  to  ?\n         ?  give the user the possibility to always do a  certain  ?\n         ?  function in the mix.based  on our experience this  is  ?\n         ?  not too often the case with reverb units whether itÃ‚Âªs  ?\n         ?  hard- or software, unless you want to spend a lot  of  ?\n         ?  money - of course exceptions tighten the rule.         ?\n         ?                                                         ?\n         ?  another focus was the cpu usage.                       ?\n         ?                                                         ?\n         ?  we think  that many  plugins eat  a lot  of cpu, thus  ?\n         ?  complicating the workflow in an unacceptable way. the  ?\n         ?  ArtsAcoustic  Reverb  is  highly  optimized  to  work  ?\n         ?  flawlessly  on  most  processors/vst  hosts   without  ?\n         ?  eating up your cpu, no matter how hard you tweak  it.  ?\n         ?  we created  the ArtsAcoustic  Reverb to  compete with  ?\n         ?  the challenge to  reach the highest  quality possible  ?\n         ?  with a native plugin that is calculated by the hostÃ‚Âªs  ?\n         ?  cpu                                                    ?\n         ?                                                         ?\n         ?                                                         ?\n         ? &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.artsacoustic.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.artsacoustic.com&lt;/a&gt;                            ?\n         ?                                                         ?\n         ?                                                         ?\n         ?                                                         ?\n         ?                                                         ?\n         ?                                                         ?\n         ?
