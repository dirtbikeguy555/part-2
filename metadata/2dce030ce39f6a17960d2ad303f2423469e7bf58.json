Isaac Bashevis Singer called Hamsun &quot;the father of the modern school of literature in his every aspect -- his subjectiveness, his fragmentariness, his use of flashbacks, his lyricism.  The whole modern school of fiction in the twentieth century stems from Hamsun.&quot;\n\nHamsun first received wide acclaim with HUNGER (1890), a semi-autobiographical novel that describes a young writer's descent into near madness as a result of hunger and poverty in the Norwegian capital.  To many, the novel presaged the writings of Franz Kafka and other twentieth-century novelists with its internal monologue and bizarre logic.  A theme to which Hamsun often returned is that of the asocial, perpetual wanderer, an itinerant stranger (often the narrator) who shows up and insinuates himself into the life of small rural communities.  This wanderer theme is central to the novels MYSTERIES (1892), PAN (1894), UNDER THE AUTUMN STAR (1906), and others.\n\nHamsun's work is determined by a deep aversion to civilization and the belief that man's only fulfilment lies with the soil.  He saw mankind and nature united in a strong, sometimes mystical bond, and his prose often contains rapturous depictions of the natural world.  This primitivism (and its concomitant distrust of all things modern) found its fullest expression in GROWTH OF THE SOIL (1917), which was immediately recognized as an epic masterpiece.  In the story of Isak, who leaves his village to clear a homestead and raise a family amid the untilled tracts of the Norwegian back country, Hamsun evokes the elemental bond between humans and the land.\n\nConsistent to the end in his antipathy to modern Anglo-American culture (he once described the U.S. as &quot;a mulatto studfarm&quot;), Hamsun was a prominent advocate of Germany and other fascist regimes and supported the Nazi occupation of Norway in World War II.  Days after Hitler's death, Hamsun wrote a eulogy for him, saying &quot;He was a warrior, a warrior for mankind, and a prophet of the gospel of justice for all nations.&quot;  After the war Hamsun was imprisoned as a traitor, sentenced to the loss of his property, temporarily put under psychiatric observation, and spent his last years in poverty.\n\nHamsun's work remains popular to this day.  In 2009, a Norwegian biographer stated, &quot;We canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t help loving him, though we have hated him all these years. . .  That's our Hamsun trauma.  He's a ghost that wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stay in the grave.&quot;\n\n\nThe following books are in PDF or ePUB format as indicated:\n\n* DREAMERS (Knopf, 1921).  Translated by W. W.
