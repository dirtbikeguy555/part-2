Actually, James had been with Motown earlier, though nothing had come of it. After growing up in Buffalo and running away to join the Naval Reserves, he ran away from the Navy to Toronto, where he was in a band with future Buffalo Springfield members Neil Young and Bruce Palmer, and with Goldy McJohn, later of Steppenwolf. As the Mynah Birds, they signed to Motown and recorded, though no record was ever released.\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.You And I\n02.Mary Jane\n03.Bustin' Out (On Funk)\n04.High On Your Love Suite\n05.Love Gun (Pt. 1)\n06.Big Time\n07.Give It To Me Baby\n08.Super Freak (Pt. 1)\n09.Fire And Desire (With Teena Marie)\n10.Standing On The Top (With The Temptations)\n11.Dance Wit' Me (Pt. 1)\n12.Cold Blooded\n13.Ebony Eyes (Feat.
