R is a powerful open-source implementation of the statistical language S, which was developed by AT&amp;T. R has eclipsed S and the commercially-available S-Plus language, and has become the de facto standard for doing, teaching, and learning computational statistics.\n\nR is both an object-oriented language and a functional language that is easy to learn, easy to use, and completely free. A large community of dedicated R users and programmers provides an excellent source of R code, functions, and data sets. R is also becoming adopted into commercial tools such as Oracle Database. Your investment in learning R is sure to pay off in the long term as R continues to grow into the go to language for statistical exploration and research.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f030869c9e2d561b7923f0fe182fb8201d9571cc","amp;dn":"Beginning+R+An+Introduction+to+Statistical+Programming","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f030869c9e2d561b7923f0fe182fb8201d9571cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,48,134,156,158,45,86,27,121,35,240,254,24,47,184,32,29,149,113,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
