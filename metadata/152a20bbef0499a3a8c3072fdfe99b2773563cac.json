It contains 12 chapters divided into three sections. Section 1 ''Fundamentals of Graphene'' deals with quantum hall effect in graphene, electronic properties of carbon nanostructures and spectral statistics of graphene nanoflakes. In Section 2 ''Graphene Synthesis,'' the optimized synthesis procedures of graphene and its derivatives are presented. The application of graphene and its nanostructured-based materials for energy storage, conservation and other extensive applications are described in Section 3 ''Application of Graphene and its Nanostructures''. We believe that this book offers broader prospective to the readers in the recent advances in graphene research, starting from fundamental science to application","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:152a20bbef0499a3a8c3072fdfe99b2773563cac","amp;dn":"Recent+Advances+in+Graphene+Research","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"152a20bbef0499a3a8c3072fdfe99b2773563cac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,42,32,187,239,4,153,163,168,195,7,47,223,233,155,39,115,86,60,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
