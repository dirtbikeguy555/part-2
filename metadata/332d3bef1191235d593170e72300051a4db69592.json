Crowe\n\n\nConnecting the math and theory of fluid mechanics to practical applications can be a difficult process. Engineering Fluid Mechanics builds on the success of previous editions to help engineers learn how to apply concepts by keeping them engaged and active throughout the book. Simple and effective examples show how key equations are utilized in practice, and step-by-step descriptions provide details into the processes that engineers follow. Each chapter also outlines the three most important things they will be able to accomplish once the concepts are learned. With its physical/visual approach, engineers will quickly gain an intuitive understanding of the principles.
