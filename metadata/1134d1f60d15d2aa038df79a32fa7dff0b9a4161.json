Whether the\nanalogy of what is beautiful is to include a beautiful woman (without\nwhom mankind has no existence) just as much as a beautiful violin depends\n on how far you would wish to take it I suppose - even all the way perhaps!\n\nMultiple languages used n this movie include glorious German Italian French\nand mainly English - subtitles are optionally included for the non English\nspoken bits, along with Dutch Romanian Spanish and Portuguese.
