This is the version you want. 100% undubbed. \n\n\n* Persona 4, another in renown and award-winning Shin Megami\nTensei series, is a riveting murder mystery RPG featuring an\nentirely new cast, loads more story, content, action, and depth.\nShortly after an urban youth begins a year-long stay in the\ncountryside town of Inaba, the rural towns peace is shattered\nby a horrific murder that leaves no clues or suspects.\nAs the lone incident develops into a series of bizarre crimes,\nhe discovers that only he and his friends have the power to\nsolve the baffling case, bring those responsible to justice,\nand restore harmony to his new home.\n\n\n\n* Voiceacting restored to high-quality Japanase. As usual,\nFMV's have English subtitles and although being rencoded, don't\nsuffer from any quality loss. Their filesize is significantly\nsmaller than the originals, due to ATLUS stuffing them with\nuseless padding, thus resulting in a smaller ISO. But NOTHING\nwas ripped nor downsampled.\n\n* Kudos to Mugi for participating on subtitling the FMV's and\nto leingod for the Opening karaoke.\n\n* Now sit back and enjoy the game... the way it's meant to be\nplayed!
