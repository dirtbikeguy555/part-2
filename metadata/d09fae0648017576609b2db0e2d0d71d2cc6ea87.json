A spiritual jazz masterpiece.\n\nDisc 1, the original album, is taken from a flawless 1965 master discovered in EMI's London vaults, without the compression or equalisation found on previous CD releases.\n\nThe Disc 2 showpiece is a recording of the only time the suite was performed live in its entirety, at the sixth Antibes Jazz Festival in 1965. From Coltrane's own reference tapes, there are also two alternative takes each of &quot;Resolution&quot; and &quot;Acknowledgement&quot;, the latter featuring bassist Art Davis and tenor man Archie Shepp.\n\n\nJohn Coltrane\n\nA Love Supreme\n\n1965\n\n2002 Deluxe Edition\n\n\n 2CDs / 2002 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist / CD 1:\n\nA Love Supreme, Pt. 1: Acknowledgement\n\nA Love Supreme, Pt. 2: Resolution\n\nA Love Supreme, Pt. 3: Pursuance\n\nA Love Supreme, Pt. 4: Psalm\n\n\nTracklist / CD 2:\n\nIntroduction by AndrÃƒÂ© Francis\n\nA Love Supreme, Pt. 1: Acknowledgement [live]\n\nA Love Supreme, Pt. 2: Resolution [live]\n\nA Love Supreme, Pt. 3: Pursuance [live]\n\nA Love Supreme, Pt. 4: Psalm [live]\n\nA Love Supreme, Pt. 2: Resolution [alternate take]\n\nA Love Supreme, Pt. 2: Resolution (Breakdown)\n\nA Love Supreme, Pt. 1: Acknowledgement [alternate take] *\n\nA Love Supreme, Pt. 1: Acknowledgement [alternate take] *\n\nDisc 1 and Disc 2 (tracks 6 to 9) recorded December 1964 at Van Gelder Recording Studio, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey\nDisc 2 (tracks 1 to 5) recorded July 1965 at the Festival Mondial du Jazz Antibes, Juan-les-Pins, France\n\n\nPersonnel:\n\nJohn Coltrane Ã¢â‚¬â€œ tenor saxophone\n\nMcCoy Tyner Ã¢â‚¬â€œ piano\n\nJimmy Garrison Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass\n\nElvin Jones Ã¢â‚¬â€œ drums\n\nand\n\nArchie Shepp Ã¢â‚¬â€œ tenor saxophone *\n\nArt Davis Ã¢â‚¬â€œ bass * \n\n\nJohn Coltrane\nA Love Supreme\n1965\n2002 Deluxe Edition\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“One thought can produce millions of vibrations and they all go back to God.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (John Coltrane)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d09fae0648017576609b2db0e2d0d71d2cc6ea87","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+-+A+Love+Supreme+1965+%2F+Deluxe+Edition+%2F+2CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d09fae0648017576609b2db0e2d0d71d2cc6ea87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,159,174,6,72,1,117,118,96,155,45,176,226,208,215,29,44,198,234,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
