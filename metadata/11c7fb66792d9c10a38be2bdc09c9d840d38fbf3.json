It was produced by Alastair Scott-Johnston, and written by Laurie Wyman (with George Evans from the 12th Series onwards). For most of its run, it starred Stephen Murray, Jon Pertwee and Leslie Phillips.\n\nProgrammes were self-contained, without much in the way of ongoing continuity. A normal episode consisted of silly-ass Sub Lieutenant Phillips, scheming Chief Petty Officer Pertwee and bemused Lt. Murray trying to get out of trouble they created for themselves without being found out by their direct superior, Commander &quot;Thunderguts&quot; Povey.\n\n\n\nCast:\nDennis Price .......
