And improper cash flow can mean the death of a business. This course reviews all the important topics you need to know for proper cash flow management and analysis. Professors Jim and Kay Stice review the difference between net income and operating cash flow, show how to interpret a cash flow statement, introduce the Jim Stice operating cash flow matrix, and describe some real cash flow catastrophes and triumphs at companies such as General Motors and Home Depot.â€¨â€¨Want to hear more from Jim and Kay?
