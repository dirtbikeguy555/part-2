It unveils the story of his music, his life, his demise, and ultimately the fragility of great artistic genius. \r\nThere are few musicians who fundamentally change their instrument, and even fewer still who transcend their instrument altogether. Jaco Pastorius did both. \r\nIn 1976, Jaco's melodic singing bass style redefined the role of the bass in modern music. Almost overnight, critics hailed Jaco Pastorius as the future of modern music, alongside popular visionaries like David Bowie, Tom Waits, Patti Smith, Bryan Ferry, Lou Reed and Herbie Hancock. \r\nDriven only by his own desire to create the music he wanted to hear, Jaco transformed himself from a poor and unknown, scrappy Florida boy, into an international sensation - all without any formal musical training. Instead of chasing popular music, Jaco led his fans towards the music inside him. Defiantly jumping off amplifiers, heaving his bass through the air, and refusing to be just a &quot;sideman,&quot; Jaco broke down the barriers between audiences and genres.\r\nUnfortunately, for many of our most sensitive artists, great genius comes at great cost... and Jaco Pastorius was no exception.\r\nNow over 25 years since his violent and untimely death, his story will teach the world about true musicianship, family, and the indestructible power of the human spirit.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/54/Jaco-The-Film-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d3/Jaco-The-Film-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d7/Jaco-The-Film-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5c/Jaco-The-Film-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d0/Jaco-The-Film-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/85/Jaco-The-Film-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/92/Jaco-The-Film-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c2/Jaco-The-Film-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f7/Jaco-The-Film-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/10/Jaco-The-Film-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/48/Jaco-The-Film-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6f/Jaco-The-Film-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f8/Jaco-The-Film-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/ce/Jaco-The-Film-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b6/Jaco-The-Film-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/16/Jaco-The-Film-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: 2 404 Kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Per Second: 23.976 fps\r\nAudio Codec: AC3\r\nAudio Bitrate: 384 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\r\nAudio Streams: 6\r\nAudio Languages: english\r\nRunTime Per Part: 1h 56mn\r\nNumber Of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 2.26 GB\r\nSource: BluRay (Thanks to TREBLE)\r\nEncoded by: DocFreak08\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nSource: \nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Jaco:_The_Film","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec771ad6df359e921316ca9fc06cbc8341c51687","amp;dn":"Jaco+The+Film+720p+BluRay+x264+AC3+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec771ad6df359e921316ca9fc06cbc8341c51687","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,119,26,214,223,53,158,146,19,22,202,159,192,108,188,131,65,197,22,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
