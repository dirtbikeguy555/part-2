While Boards of Canada's blissful/melancholic IDM is an obvious inspiration, many of Tycho's productions play out like complete electronic dream pop songs in isolation rather than vignettes or extended mood pieces. Tycho debuted in 2002 with The Science of Patterns, a self-released four-track EP. Sunrise Projector, his first album, was released in 2004 on the Gammaphone label. After the 2006 album Past Is Prologue, recorded for Merck, he settled in with Ghostly International, where he released a trio of singles and EPs (&quot;The Daydream,&quot; &quot;Adrift,&quot; &quot;Coastal Brake&quot;) prior to the 2011 album Dive. While working on material and singles for his next LP, 2013 saw the re-release of Past Is Prologue, this time on Ghostly. Awake, Tycho's proper follow-up to Dive, was released in early 2014.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a0cc13390d8145ca7cf09f8ee3f749d7bcac030","amp;dn":"Tycho+-+Discography+%282002-2014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a0cc13390d8145ca7cf09f8ee3f749d7bcac030","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,12,193,51,144,216,20,92,167,207,9,248,238,63,116,157,123,202,192,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
