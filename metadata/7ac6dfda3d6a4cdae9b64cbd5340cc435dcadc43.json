An extraordinary situation calls for an extraordinary solution. At strife-torn Eastside High School in Paterson, New Jersey, that solution had a name: Principal &quot;Crazy Joe&quot; Clark. With a bullhorn in one hand and a baseball bat in the other, he slammed the door on losers at Eastside. Brought in as a last resort to stop the state government from taking control of the school, Clark chained the doors shut to keep troublemakers OUT and achievers IN. Parents fought him. Teachers resented him. Even his own boss doubted him. But lots of kids loved him. Clark turned Eastside around, appearing on the cover of &quot;Time Magazine&quot; and becoming a national symbol of tough-love education. &quot;If you don't succeed in life,&quot; Clark tells his students, &quot;don't blame your backgrounds. Don't blame the Establishment. Blame YOURSELVES.&quot; His message is simple: Don't lean on excuses, drugs, crime, or anger. LEAN ON ME...and learn.\n\n\nTAGLINE: A true story about a real hero. Eastside High was a training ground for jail. Then Joe Clark took over. Now the kids are getting something they never had. A future. \n\n\nAll stand-alone divx players compatible\n\n\nENJOY &amp; PLEASE SEED FOR AS LONG AS U CAN !!!!! \n\n\nALSO IF YOU HAVE ANY REQUESTS DON'T HESITATE TO ASK.
