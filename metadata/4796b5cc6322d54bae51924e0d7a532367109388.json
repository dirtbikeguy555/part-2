Ignore accusations of cynical marketing and inauthenticity, or speculation about surgery and DaddyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s money ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not important. And donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get distracted by the YouTube statistics or the online hyperbole, this isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t about new media. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s about something older and more mysterious than that; the extraordinary, resilient power of the pop song. For all of her trashy Americana and startling beauty, if Del Rey hadnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t arrived last summer with a song as luminously beautiful as Video Games, none of this would be happening.\n\nSo the only truly important question about Born to Die is whether thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more where that came from. Cynics look away: the answer is an emphatic yes. Nothing else quite matches Video GamesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ eerie perfection of form and melody ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ after all, 99% of singers go an entire career without finding one song that good ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but several run it perilously close, while revealing thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more to her than the love-stunned torch singer of Video Games.\n\nWhat makes Born to Die so richly fascinating ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and what marks Del Rey out from the standard issue &quot;IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m hot, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re hot&quot; pop starlet ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ is her preoccupation with Hollywood archetypes of American femininity, and her ability to shape-shift between them. So, on the stately, bloodstained title-track, Del Rey plays femme fatale, deliciously stoned and doomed, with an imperious vocal to match. On the addictive, sugar-rushing Off to the Races sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s trailer trash living the high life, her vocal veering deftly between husky cynicism and hiccupping glee; while on the tender This Is What Makes Us Girls sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the poor little rich girl looking melancholically back on youthful hedonism.\n\nIt all reaches its apotheosis on National Anthem where Del Rey, dissatisfied with merely being an all-American girl, becomes America itself, offering up deadpan slogans like &quot;money is the reason we exist&quot; before demanding utter patriotic devotion on the swaggering chorus. If that sounds knowing thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s because it is, not to mention intelligent, ambitious, and more interesting than anything Adele is likely to write even by the time her inevitable 72 collection hits the shelves of the future. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s also brilliantly realised, thanks to Del ReyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s extraordinary delivery, her ability to slip from deep toned haughtiness to breathless ecstasy to velvety vamping ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ often in the same gorgeous melody.\n\nBorn to Die isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t perfect: it slumps slightly towards the end, and the glossy trip-hop production grows wearying on lesser gothic melodramas like Dark Paradise. But itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the most distinctive and assured debut since GlasvegasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ eponymous disc in 2008, and makes you desperate to see where she goes from here. Del ReyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s defenders can take a break: Born to Die does their job better than they could hope to.\n-Jaime Gill (BBC Review) \n\n\nCD ripped by Someone else using X Lossless Decoder thank you.\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4796b5cc6322d54bae51924e0d7a532367109388","amp;dn":"Lana+Del+Rey...Born+To+Die...deluxe%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4796b5cc6322d54bae51924e0d7a532367109388","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,150,181,204,99,34,213,75,174,81,146,78,13,122,83,35,103,16,147,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
