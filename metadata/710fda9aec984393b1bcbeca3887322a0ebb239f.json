Rule is everything a straight--A pre-med student like Shaw shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want--and the only person sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never tried to please. She isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t afraid of his scary piercings and tattoos or his wild attitude. Though she knows that Rule is wrong for her, her heart just wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t listen.\n\nTo a rebel like Rule Archer, Shaw Landon is a stuck-up, perfect princess-and his dead twin brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s girl. She lives by other peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rules; he makes his own. He doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have time for a good girl like Shaw-even if sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the only one who can see the person he truly is.\n\nBut a short skirt, too many birthday cocktails, and spilled secrets lead to a night neither can forget. Now, Shaw and Rule have to figure out how a girl like her and a guy like him are supposed to be together without destroying their love . . . or each other. \n\nJet (Marked Men #2) by Jay Crownover (May 28th 2013) \n\nWith his tight leather pants and a sharp edge that makes him dangerous, Jet Keller is every girlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rock and roll fantasy. But Ayden Cross is done walking on the wild side with bad boys. She doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to give in to the heat she sees in JetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dark, haunted eyes. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s afraid of getting burned from the sparks of their spontaneous combustion, even as his touch sets her on fire.\n\nJet canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t resist the Southern Belle with mile-long legs in cowboy boots who defies his every expectation. Yet the closer he feels to Ayden, the less he seems to know her. While heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tempted to get under her skin and undo her in every way, he knows firsthand what happens to two people with very different ideas about relationships.\n\nWill the blaze burn into an enduring love. . . or will it consume their dreams and turn them to ashes? \n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:710fda9aec984393b1bcbeca3887322a0ebb239f","amp;dn":"Marked+Men+Series+%281-2%29+by+Jay+Crownover+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"710fda9aec984393b1bcbeca3887322a0ebb239f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,15,218,154,236,152,67,147,177,188,190,202,56,135,50,42,14,187,35,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
