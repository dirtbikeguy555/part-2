Ã¢â‚¬Å“Roots &amp; GroovesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (2007) finds Parker cutting loose with GermanyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s incredible WDR Big Band. Vol. 1 features a swinging Ray Charles tribute and Vol. 2, subtitled &quot;Back to Funk,&quot; has the alto saxophonist and vocalist taking it to the bridge on the music he is famous for. The concept of playing hard funk with a brassy big band in tow is somewhat unusual, but the results smash all preconceptions.\n\n\nMaceo Parker\n\n1.
