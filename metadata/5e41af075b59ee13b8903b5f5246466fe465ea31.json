From the classroom to the courtroom and from financial markets to supermarkets, Mlodinow's intriguing and illuminating look at how randomness, chance, and probability affect our daily lives will intrigue, awe, and inspire.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e41af075b59ee13b8903b5f5246466fe465ea31","amp;dn":"The+Drunkard%27s+Walk+How+Randomness+Rules+Our+Lives+by+Leonard+Ml","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e41af075b59ee13b8903b5f5246466fe465ea31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,65,175,7,91,89,238,19,184,144,59,95,82,70,70,111,228,101,234,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
