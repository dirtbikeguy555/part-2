Each case history is followed by questions on important aspects of the diagnosis, interpretation of investigations, and management. The answers are accompanied by a detailed discussion, including the differential diagnosis where relevant and other clinically important aspects of the condition. The book contains numerous illustrations of echocardiographic, radiographic and electrocardiographic data. The list of cases by diagnosis and category according to the cardiology curriculum from the JRCPTB and the extensive index allows the book to be used for revision and reference.\n\nThe book will be of particular use to post-membership trainees who are preparing for specialty knowledge based assessments in cardiology and acute general medicine and will also be of interest to those who wish to improve their skills in diagnosis and management of a broad range of cardiac diseases.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f133f12f26e6cf0b81d553b608683eff952aa8a","amp;dn":"Oxford+Case+Histories+in+Cardiology+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f133f12f26e6cf0b81d553b608683eff952aa8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,19,63,18,242,110,108,240,184,29,85,59,96,134,131,239,249,82,170,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
