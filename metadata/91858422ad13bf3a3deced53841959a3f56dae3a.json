The album reached number three on the UK Albums Chart. It reached number two on the Billboard 200. In the US the album spawned four singles, &quot;If You Love Somebody Set Them Free&quot;, &quot;Fortress Around Your Heart&quot;, &quot;Russians&quot; and &quot;Love Is the Seventh Wave&quot;. The album earned Grammy nominations for Album of the Year, Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, Best Jazz Instrumental Performance and Best Engineered Recording.\r\n\r\nThe album is named after a dream of Sting's. Although the single &quot;If You Love Somebody Set Them Free&quot; reached number three in the US, it was a relative flop in the UK, where the album's track &quot;Russians&quot; (about Cold War nuclear anxieties, which had peaked in the 1980s) proved more popular.\r\n\r\nIn the UK the album was kept off number one in the week of its release by Marillion's Misplaced Childhood and Born in the U.S.A. by Bruce Springsteen occupying the top two places. However, in the United States, the album reached number two on the Billboard 200.\r\n\r\nThe movie Bring on the Night documents some of the recording work that produced this album, as well as the subsequent tour.\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n1.If You Love Somebody Set Them Free\r\n2.Love Is the Seventh Wave\r\n3.Russians\r\n4.Children?s Crusade\r\n5.Shadows in the Rain\r\n6.We Work the Black Seam\r\n7.Consider Me Gone\r\n8.The Dream of the Blue Turtles\r\n9.Moon over Bourbon Street\r\n10.Fortress Around Your Hear\r\n\r\n*1985 A&amp;M Records - A&amp;M SP-3750\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel:\r\nSting: lead vocals, guitar, double bass on &quot;Moon over Bourbon Street&quot;\r\nOmar Hakim: drums\r\nDarryl Jones: bass guitar\r\nKenny Kirkland: keyboards\r\nBranford Marsalis: soprano and tenor saxophones, miscellaneous percussion\r\nDolette McDonald: backing vocals\r\nJanice Pendarvis: backing vocals\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91858422ad13bf3a3deced53841959a3f56dae3a","amp;dn":"Sting+-+The+Dream+Of+The+Blue+Turtles+%281985%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91858422ad13bf3a3deced53841959a3f56dae3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,133,132,34,173,19,191,58,61,236,237,83,132,25,89,163,245,109,174,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
