Sullivan (Private #11)\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nParis is burning â€“ and only Private's Jack Morgan can put out the fire. \r\n\r\nWhen Jack Morgan stops by Private's Paris office, he envisions a quick hello during an otherwise relaxing trip filled with fine food and sightseeing. But Jack is quickly pressed into duty after a call from his client Sherman Wilkerson, asking Jack to track down his young granddaughter who is on the run from a brutal drug dealer. \r\n\r\nBefore Jack can locate her, several members of France's cultural elite are found dead â€“ murdered in stunning, symbolic fashion. The only link between the crimes is a mysterious graffiti tag.
