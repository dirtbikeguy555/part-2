Often, the perfect tool is the one-liner, a small but powerful program that fits in one line of code and does one thing really well.\n\nIn Perl One-Liners, author and impatient hacker Peteris Krumins takes you through more than 100 compelling one-liners that do all sorts of handy things, such as manipulate line spacing, tally column values in a table, and get a list of users on a system. This cookbook of useful, customizable, and fun scripts will even help hone your Perl coding skills, as Krumins dissects the code to give you a deeper understanding of the language.\n\nYou'll find one-liners that:\n\nEncode, decode, and convert strings\nGenerate random passwords\nCalculate sums, factorials, and the mathematical constants p and e\nAdd or remove spaces\nNumber lines in a file\nPrint lines that match a specific pattern\nCheck to see if a number is prime with a regular expression\nConvert IP address to decimal form\nReplace one string with another\n\nAnd many more! Save time and sharpen you coding skills as you learn to conquer those pesky tasks in a few precisely placed keystrokes with Perl One-Liners.\n\n\n\nimage\nScientia est potentia\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:065402d0bdbe032578fba60eb90c01d62f1b7466","amp;dn":"Perl+One-Liners%2C+130+Programs+That+Get+Things+Done+%5BPDF%5D%7EStormRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"065402d0bdbe032578fba60eb90c01d62f1b7466","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,84,2,208,189,190,3,37,120,251,166,14,185,12,1,214,47,27,116,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
