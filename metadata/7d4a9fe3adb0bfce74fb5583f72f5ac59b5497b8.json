The downside of repetitive motion, however, is that it taxes a few select groups of muscles (hamstrings, quadriceps, hip flexors and Achilles) and neglects the remainder. This leads to muscular imbalances and, eventually, injury.\n\nThis book addresses these imbalances by using yoga postures to both stretch and lengthen these short, tight running hotspots in a way that is time-efficient and highly targeted.\n\nLike yoga it's a union of all these physical and mental aspects that affect the performance of the runner as a whole. Practice the techniques together to become a stronger, smoother runner who is less prone to injury. Breathe deeper and more efficiently to train for longer. Gain a clear head to tackle negative distractions as you train or race, and in life generally.\n\nSales points:\n\n1. Specifically targeted at runners who want to use yoga to improve their performance and prevent injury.\n\n2. Author is experienced at using yoga to help runners of all abilities.\n\n3. Yoga is increasingly popular as a counterbalance to more intensive running training.\n\n4. Includes poses, exercises and meditations for particular situations.\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d4a9fe3adb0bfce74fb5583f72f5ac59b5497b8","amp;dn":"Yoga+for+Runners+-+Lexie+Williamson+-+Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d4a9fe3adb0bfce74fb5583f72f5ac59b5497b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,74,159,227,173,176,191,206,116,251,85,131,247,47,90,197,155,84,151,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
