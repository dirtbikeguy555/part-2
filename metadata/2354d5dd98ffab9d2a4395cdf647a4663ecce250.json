The COMPLETE install DVD for Cinema 4D 11.5, WITH the Mac installers, plus I included all the extra language files from Maxon's site.\n\n\nIncludes:\n\nCinema 4D Studio install DVD for Mac OS X and Windows\n  Cinema 4D 11.514\n  BodyPaint 3D\n  Advanced Render\n  MOCCA\n  MoGraph\n  Thinking Particles\n  Hair\n  Dynamics\n  Sketch &amp; Toon\n  NET Render\nArchitecture Extension Kit\nEngineering Extension Kit\nBroadcast Extension Kit\n\nFrench language updater\nFrench help installer\nItalian language installer\nItalian help installer\nJapanese language updater\nJapanese help installer\nKorean language updater\nKorean help installer\nRussian help installer\nSpanish help installer\n\nAnd a text file containing the magic numbers. :)\n\n\n\n     English and German are included in the basic installation.  All the extras are archived in separate files in case you don't want everything, in ISO and Zip format so Windows users can have it too.\n\n\nMinimum system requirements:\n\n  Mac OS\n  - Mac OS X Tiger {10.4.11}, Leopard {10.5.3+} or Snow Leopard {10.6+}\n  - 1 GiB RAM\n  - G5 or Intel processor\n  - OpenGL-capable graphics card (all Macs are equipped with one)\n  - Monitor resolution of 1024x768 pixels with 24-bit colour depth\n  - 1 GB of free hard drive space (not including documentation)\n\n  Windows\n  - 2003 Server, XP, 2008 Server, Vista or Seven\n  - Internet Explorer 8 for Windows Seven operating systems\n  - 1 GiB RAM\n  - Pentium 4, Athlon 64, Sempron (K8 with SSE2) or VIA C7\n  - OpenGL-capable graphics card\n  - Monitor resolution of 1024x768 pixels with 24-bit colour depth\n  - 1 GB of free hard drive space (not including documentation)\n\n\n     Tested on a Mac Pro with Leopard {10.5.8}.  Virus-free and fully functional, as far as I can tell.  Maxon are not exaggerating in their advertizing.  They at least doubled the render speed compared to 11.0.  Shadow maps use all available cores now, not only one, and generate at least 10x faster!  If you like this and use it for commercial work, buy it.  It's worth every penny.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2354d5dd98ffab9d2a4395cdf647a4663ecce250","amp;dn":"Cinema+4D+Studio+11.514+complete+%7BMac+OS+X%2FWindows%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2354d5dd98ffab9d2a4395cdf647a4663ecce250","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,84,213,221,152,255,171,157,42,67,149,205,246,71,164,102,62,204,226,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
