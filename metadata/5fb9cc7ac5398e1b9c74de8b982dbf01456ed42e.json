This software can remove DPF or FAP automatically from program of car. Filter can be removed without causing any errors or abnormal car behavior. Speed limiter removal in many cars and trucks is possible. Special AD1 module helps to correct and reduce AdBlue consumption in trucks.\n\nRemoving of FAP / DPF is easy ! All you need is to read original file from car and process it with proper ECUsafe module, designed to find and remove all important DPF structures automatically, without your attendance. \n\nFile can be then directly written in ECU, or it can be tuned by you and then - written into car. DPF can be removed from car, sensors left unplugged (no sensors at all) or left in the exhaust. It does not matter.\n\nNo more regeneration, no more black smoke behind. No more DPF check light or lamps on the dashboard. Add DPF removal offer to your workshop capabilities !\n\nFollowing modules can cover your car range:\n-\n DP1 - VW, Audi, Seat, Skoda - all EDC16 &amp; EDC17 diesels (1.4 TDI, 1.9 TDI, 2.0 TDI, 2.5 TDI, 2.7 TDI, 3.0 TDI, 4.2 TDI, 5.0 TDI etc. )\n- DP2 - Fiat, Opel, Alfa, Lancia, Saab, Chevrolet - all EDC16 &amp; EDC17 diesels (1.9 JTD/CDTI, 2.0, 2.4 JTD, etc.) \n- DP3 - Peugeot, Citroen, Renault, Nissan - all EDC16 diesels, also PSA &amp; Fiat group EDC15,            Siemens SID PSA, Delphi DCM3.x.\n- DP4 - Ford, Jaguar, Honda, Volvo, Mazda EDC16 &amp; EDC17 and Siemens SID diesels\n- DP5 - BMW, Mini EDC16 &amp; EDC17 diesels.\n- DP6 - Mercedes EDC16 &amp; EDC17 diesels.\n- DP7 - Kia / Hyundai EDC16 &amp; EDC17 diesels, Suzuki EDC16 diesels.\n- DP8 - Fiat, Opel Marelli MJD diesels.\n- AD1 - AdBlue Scania (AdBlue removal / reduction)\n\nSoftware includes FAP/DPF level EEPROM editor. You can open EEPROM file. This is useful in case, when too high level of fill of FAP is stored in EEPROM of ECU. In that case even removing FAP from main memory of ECU may omit dashboard blinking error. You can edit EEPROM memory and set level of FAP to any level (or reset it). EEPROM checksum is calculated automatically.\n\nAdBlue can be also corrected directly from ECUsafe.\n\n\nThis is original not cracked and not extracted installation. The activation key should be generated for your PC hardware personally.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fb9cc7ac5398e1b9c74de8b982dbf01456ed42e","amp;dn":"ECUsafe+2.0.0.0+all+modules+original+setup+no+crack+or+keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fb9cc7ac5398e1b9c74de8b982dbf01456ed42e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,185,204,122,197,57,142,27,156,116,222,139,152,45,191,1,69,110,212,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
