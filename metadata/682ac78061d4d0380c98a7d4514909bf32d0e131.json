The sea holds all the voices of the earth and those that come from outer space. Water receives impetus from the stars and transmits it to living creatures. Water, the longest border in Chile, also holds the secret of two mysterious buttons which were found on its ocean floor. Chile, with its 2,670 miles of coastline and the largest archipelago in the world, presents a supernatural landscape. In it are volcanoes, mountains and glaciers. In it are the voices of the Patagonian Indigenous people, the first English sailors and also those of its political prisoners. Some say that water has memory. This film shows that it also has a voice. \r\n\r\nRip Specs (BD Rip)\r\n\r\nGeneral           : El boton de nacar 2015 720p BluRay DTS5.1 x264 DTS-GrupoHDS.mkv\r\nFormat            : Matroska at 8 993 Kbps\r\nLength            : 5.15 GiB for 1h 21mn 59s 373ms\r\n\r\nVideo #0          : AVC at 7 482 Kbps\r\nAspect            : 1280 x 720 (1.778) at 23.976 fps\r\n\r\nAudio #0          : DTS at 1 509 Kbps\r\nInfos             : 6 channels, 48.0 KHz\r\nLanguage          : es\r\n\r\nText #0           : UTF-8\r\nLanguage          : en\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt4377864/\r\n\r\nAudio Language: Spanish\r\nSubtitles: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:682ac78061d4d0380c98a7d4514909bf32d0e131","amp;dn":"El+boton+de+nacar+2015+720p+BluRay+DTS5.1+x264+DTS-GrupoHDS.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"682ac78061d4d0380c98a7d4514909bf32d0e131","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,42,199,128,97,212,208,56,12,152,167,212,81,73,9,191,50,208,225,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
