After the service, he attempts to console a fisherman (Jonas Persson) who is tormented by anxiety, but Tomas can only speak about his own troubled relationship with God. A school teacher (Maerta Lundberg) offers Tomas her love as consolation for his loss of faith. But Tomas resists her love as desperately as she offers it to him. This is the second in Bergman's trilogy of films dealing with man's relationship with God.\n\nName.........: Winter Light.avi\nFilesize.....: 699 MB (or 716,758 KB or 733,960,192 bytes)\nRuntime......: 01:21:15 (116,887 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1135 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID'd as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 61 kb/s, monophonic VBR\nFrame Size...: 592x448 (1.32:1) [=37:28]\nFPS..........: 23.976\n\nSwedish audio, english and portuguese subtitles.\n\nnot my rip.\n\n\n*********************************** FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
