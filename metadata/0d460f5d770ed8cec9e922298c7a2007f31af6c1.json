Nevertheless, it is recognized as one of the most important political films, and got its due by being seletected to the National Film Registry, Library of Congress, in 1992. Based on actual events, this landmark film depicts a strike by Mexican-American mineworkers in New Mexico. With the exception of five actors, the cast comprises non-professionals, mostly participants in the real-life strike. The film is remarkably prophetic in its portrayal of the wives of the oppressed workers which seem to anticipate the women's liberation movement that would rise over a decade later. Against a backdrop of social injustice, a riveting family drama is played out by the characters of Ramon and Esperanza Quintero, a Mexican-American miner and his wife. In the course of the strike, Ramon and Esperanza find their roles reversed: an injunction against the male strikers moves the women to take over the picket line, leaving the men to domestic duties. The women evolve from the men's subordinates into their allies and equals.\n\nFile Name .........................................: Salt of the Earth.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 850,525,524 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:33:53\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: DivX 5.1.1\nFrame Size ......................................: 640x480 (AR: 1.333)\nFPS .................................................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1070 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.145 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 44100 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 128 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047443/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0047443/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio; French, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted at Karagarga by maldoror1020, whom we thank","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d460f5d770ed8cec9e922298c7a2007f31af6c1","amp;dn":"Salt+of+the+Earth+%28Biberman%2C+1954%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d460f5d770ed8cec9e922298c7a2007f31af6c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,70,15,93,119,14,216,206,201,233,34,41,140,122,32,7,243,26,246,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
