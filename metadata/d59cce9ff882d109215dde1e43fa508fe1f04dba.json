Well, Vanaheim. We're going to Vanaheim for adventures, fun and bleak existential horror! Does Loki join the pursuit of Angela and her tiny, diaper-wearing charge? Well, we'd have to be really cruel to mention him here if he's not going to turn up. Loki Lies, not solicits. Solicits are always 100% honest. Plus, find out why saying 'All good angels go to heaven' would get you stabbed by Angela. She's a little touchy on the topic of the afterlife.
