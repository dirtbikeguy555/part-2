During that time, Puente - rooted in Spanish Harlem, of Puerto Rican descent - never strayed far from his jazz roots.\n In 1983, he started reeling off a string of several Latin jazz albums with octets or big bands for Concord that gave him greater exposure and respect in the jazz world than he ever had.\n\n Among the numbers featured here are rousing salsa renditions of Miles Davis' &quot;All Blues,&quot; and Duke Ellington's &quot;Sophisticated Lady,&quot; as well as other tunes by Thelonious Monk, George Shearing, Chick Corea, Sonny Rollins, and John Coltrane. Some of Puente's best-known compositions including &quot;Oye Como Va,&quot; &quot;Mambo King,&quot; and &quot;Machito Forever&quot; are also included. Standout tracks include a 4/4 version of &quot;Take Five,&quot; and a blisteringly fast &quot;Donna Lee,&quot; featuring a wonderful piccolo solo.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Best of the Concord YearsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ provides another chance to hear several fiery Afro-Cuban jazz performances, proving that &quot;The King of Latin Music&quot; refused to slow down, even after it was expected of him.\n\n\n\nTito PuenteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Latin Jazz Ensemble and Orchestra\n\n The Best of the Concord Years\n\n 1983 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1996\n\n\n \n 2 CDs / 2000 / 320Kbps\n\n\n\nTracklist / CD 1:\n   \n 1.
