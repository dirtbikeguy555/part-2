While the audience sees the presentation on the main display, Display Foldback lets the stage see a custom display with the current presentation, a preview of the next scheduled item, a clock and private alerts.\n\nCustomize the way the stage sees PowerPoint presentations with variable thumbnails for previous, current and next slide.\n\n\nVJ Mode (Video Jockey):\n\nOne-Click Video Switching\n\nThis is the perfect place for planned spontaneity. In VJ Mode, switching backgrounds during a live song or scripture takes one click.\n\nThe option to view your media library in the Live Area makes it easy to fade between backgrounds on the fly while keeping up with song lyrics or scripture changes\n\n\nWeb Integration:\n\nFull Screen YouTube Videos\n\nWith URL scheduling and full screen YouTube video playback, EasyWorship 2009 helps you connect your audience to the web. Use the online feature to show your church's new website or latest YouTube video.\n\nEasyWorship 2009 also provides access to the online media store, which includes integrated downloads so media is automatically placed in the correct library in EasyWorship.\n\n\nAudio Integration:\n\nScheduled Playback\n\nImport and organize your audio files for scheduled playback during a presentation, or assign a single audio file to multiple lyric or scripture slides. EasyWorship's new media player displays total and elapsed time with controls for volume, mute, play/pause, repeat and seek.\n\n\nUpdated User Interface:\n\nCleaner, More Intuitive Design\n\nNow theme-aware for XP, Vista and Windows 7, EasyWorship 2009 introduces updated buttons and icons throughout, modernized look and feel, general layout improvements and updated interface controls for video, DVD and feeds.\n\nPlease SEED SEED as long as possible.............\n\nTo Know more about the software visit:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.easyworship.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.easyworship.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nUploaded By Abraham","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0eb23004632081bcc33d922a43e7cc887e6620c","amp;dn":"Easy+Worship+%282009%29+with+Crack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0eb23004632081bcc33d922a43e7cc887e6620c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,235,35,0,70,50,8,27,204,51,217,34,164,62,124,200,135,230,98,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
