Players can choose from 50 levels and 3 gameplay modes. New puzzles are unlocked by building contraptions quickly and efficiently.\r\n\r\n    Inventor Mode: Starting with simple puzzles, players are introduced to the widgets that are used to build machines â€” gears, pipes, balloons, chimes, hammers, wheels, props, and more.\r\n    Time Challenge Mode: If you finish a puzzle in Inventor Mode, it will be unlocked here. This time, it will take fewer moves to reach a solution, but you only have 30 seconds to find it.\r\n    Move Challenge Mode: Take your time and plan ahead.
