From their beginnings as Oklahoma weirdos to their mid-'90s pop culture breakthrough to their status as one of the most respected groups of the 2000s, the Lips rode one of the more surreal and haphazard career trajectories in pop music. An acid-bubblegum band with as much affinity for sweet melodies as blistering noise assaults, their off-kilter sound, uncommon emotional depth, and bizarre history (packed with tales of self-immolating fans and the like) firmly established them as true originals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c0a07f6fd44a98af537e0e002cf75d8d1485575","amp;dn":"The+Flaming+Lips+-+With+a+Little+Help+From+My+Fwends+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c0a07f6fd44a98af537e0e002cf75d8d1485575","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,10,7,246,253,68,169,138,245,55,224,224,2,207,117,216,209,72,85,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
