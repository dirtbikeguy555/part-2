It is planned to be released on April 29, 2013 through the Sony Music Entertainment subsidiary label, RCA. Written and recorded throughout 2012, Sempiternal showed the band pool diverse influences from electronic music, ambient music and pop. &quot;Sempiternal&quot; is an archaic English word denoting the concept of &quot;everlasting time&quot; that can never actually come to pass.[2] It stems from the Latin root word &quot;Sempiternal&quot;. The album's cover art is a depiction of the Flower of Life. This will be the last album to feature rhythm guitarist Jona Weinhofen, who left shortly after recording finished in January 2013, and the first album to feature keyboardist Jordan Fish.\n\nTrack listing\n\nNo.\tTitle\tLength\t\n1.\t&quot;Can You Feel My Heart&quot;  \t3:47\n2.\t&quot;The House of Wolves&quot;  \t3:25\n3.\t&quot;Empire (Let Them Sing)&quot;  \t3:45\n4.\t&quot;Sleepwalking&quot;  \t3:50\n5.\t&quot;Go to Hell, for Heaven's Sake&quot;  \t4:02\n6.\t&quot;Shadow Moses&quot;  \t4:03\n7.\t&quot;And the Snakes Start to Sing&quot;  \t5:01\n8.\t&quot;Seen it all Before&quot;  \t4:07\n9.\t&quot;Antivist&quot;  \t3:13\n10.\t&quot;Crooked Young&quot;  \t3:34\n11.\t&quot;Hospital for Souls&quot;  \t6:44\n\nThis is a CD quality, 320 kbps leak, so as always ENJOY!\n\n:)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f130d64f918347b6ffb518f69fba8bfbc21e0c1","amp;dn":"Bring+Me+The+Horizon+-+Sempiternal+%28320+kbps%29+LEAKED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f130d64f918347b6ffb518f69fba8bfbc21e0c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,19,13,100,249,24,52,123,111,251,81,143,105,251,168,191,188,33,224,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
