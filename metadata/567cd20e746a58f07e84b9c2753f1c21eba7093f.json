Japan is now referred to as Area 11, and its\npeople the 11's. A Britannian who was living in Japan at the time, Lelouch,\nvowed to his Japanese friend Suzaku that he'd destroy Britannia. Years later,\nLelouch is in high school, but regularly skips out of school to go play chess\nand gamble on himself. One day, he stumbles on terrorists 11's who've stolen\na military secret and is caught by a member of the Britannian task force sent\nafter them, who is Suzaku. As the rest of the squad arrives, Suzaku is shot for\ndisobeying orders, while the military secret, a young girl, gives Lelouch the\npower of Geass, which makes anyone obey any order. While Suzaku is\nsecretly made the pilot of Britannia's brand new prototype Knightmare,\nLancelot, Lelouch becomes the masked Zero to lead the rebellion\nto destroy Britannia once and for all.\n\nCode Geass R2:\nIt's been one year since the failure of the Black Rebellion and the\nsupposed death of Zero. Britannia has assigned Area 11 a &quot;correctional\neducation&quot; status, where Elevens are made an example of by brute force,\nto try to prevent any future uprisings and suppress rebellious thoughts.\nUnsuspecting high school student Lelouch, oblivious to his rebellious\npast as Zero, stumbles upon a scheme on his life and the life of a\nmysterious woman known as C.C., who reveals to him his forgotten\npurpose and his &quot;true&quot; self. Destroying his assailants and declaring\nhimself Zero once again, Lelouch sets out to finish what he started.\n\nGenres:\naction, drama, psychological,\nscience fiction, supernatural\n\nThemes:\nmecha, military,\nreal robot\n\nObjectionable content: Significant\n(bloody violence and/or swearing and/or nudity)\n\n\nFormat .......................................................: Matroska\nFile size ......................................................: 98.5 MiB\nDuration ..................................................: 24mn 09s\nOverall bit rate .........................................: 570 Kbps\nWidth .....................................................: 1280 pixels\nHeight ......................................................: 720 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio ........................................: 16:9\nFrame rate ..............................................: 23.976 fps\nAudio .............................: Eng &amp; Jap AAC @ 48KHz\nSubs .....................................................................:ASS\n\n//==========================================\\\\\n((&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;))\n\\\\==========================================//\n\n\n\n\n\n!!Check out my favorite anime movies/short OVA super packs!!\n************************************************************************\n***********Anime movie &amp; short OVA super pack VOL.1***********\n***********Anime movie &amp; short OVA super pack VOL.2***********\n************************************************************************\n!!Lots of rare, hard to find titles and must have classics.
