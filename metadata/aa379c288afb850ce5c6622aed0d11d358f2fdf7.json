It will be the first album released by the second lineup of the band, featuring bassist and keyboardist Ian Peres, guitarist Aidan Nemeth and drummer Dave Atkins, formed after original members Chris Ross and Myles Heskett left in August 2008.\n\nThe album was recorded between April and May 2009 at Sound City Studios and Sunset Sound Studios in Los Angeles, California. The title of the album comes from a position in yoga described by vocalist and guitarist Andrew Stockdale as &quot;like the fetal pose.&quot; The album's release will be followed by a world tour beginning in November. The first song released from the album was the promotional digital download single &quot;Back Round&quot; on 2 June 2009; &quot;New Moon Rising&quot; was the first full single release from Cosmic Egg, on 25 August 2009.\n\n   1. &quot;California Queen&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:54\n   2. &quot;New Moon Rising&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45\n   3. &quot;White Feather&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:04\n   4. &quot;Sundial&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47\n   5. &quot;In the Morning&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:39\n   6. &quot;10,000 Feet&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:08\n   7. &quot;Cosmic Egg&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:04\n   8. &quot;Far Away&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:00\n   9. &quot;Cosmonaut&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:48\n  10. &quot;Pilgrim&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:50\n  11. &quot;Eyes Open&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:11\n  12. &quot;Back Round&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n  13. &quot;In the Castle&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:42\n  14. &quot;Caroline&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:30\n  15. &quot;Phoenix&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:45\n  16. &quot;Violence of the Sun&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:02\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa379c288afb850ce5c6622aed0d11d358f2fdf7","amp;dn":"Wolfmother+-+Cosmic+Egg+CDRip+2009+%5BCov%2BCD%5D%5BBubanee%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa379c288afb850ce5c6622aed0d11d358f2fdf7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,55,156,40,138,251,133,12,229,198,98,42,237,13,17,211,88,242,253,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
