You get the Classic Equalizer module, a 6-band parametric mastering EQ thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s part of the T-RackS Classic bundle, and weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve also provided you with the T-RackS Metering Suite, which contains a host of useful and detailed displays including Peak, Perceived Loudness, Phase, and RMS meters, plus a Spectrum analyzer with Peak, RMS and Averaging indicators. Both the EQ and meters can be instantiated as separate plug-ins in your DAW, or as part of the integrated T-RackS shell, which features 8 plug-in slots, and allows you to chain up to 12 processors.\n\nYou can also run the T-RackS integrated module as a standalone program, from which you can master your mixes.
