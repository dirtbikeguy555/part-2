Some went on to create governments that were accountable to their constituents. We take these institutions for granted, but they are absent or are unable to perform in many of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s developing countriesÃ¢â‚¬â€with often disastrous consequences for the rest of the world.\n\nFrancis Fukuyama, author of the bestselling The End of History and the Last Man and one of our most important political thinkers, provides a sweeping account of how todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s basic political institutions developed.
