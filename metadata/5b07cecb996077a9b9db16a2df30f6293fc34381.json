Join Joseph Labrecque as he demonstrates how to create interactive and static graphics for the web. He shows you how to get started with a new project and use the fundamental components of the interface: the panels, the workspace, the stage, the timeline, and the pasteboard. Next, he explores importing AI and PSD files, including leveraging tools that allow you to modify imported content. Then, he walks you through working with text, drawing shapes, creating vector objects, and maintaining these assets in an organized library. Of course, this course wouldn't be complete without a breakdown of essential animation features. So, you'll get to see how to use the timeline, add motion or shape tweens, code interactive buttons, and finally publish to various formats.\r\n\r\nBecause new web standards continue to emerge, this course is designed to help you ensure your animations are compatible with the most current browsers, platforms, and devices. This course covers how to take advantage of the native support of HTML5 Canvas and javascript in Animate CC. Testing within the product is also discussed, in addition to testing outside of Animate using browsers.\r\n\r\nTopics include:\r\n\r\nSetting up your workspace\r\nUsing the stage and the pasteboard\r\nImporting images, Illustrator files, and Photoshop files\r\nModifying text\r\nDrawing shapes and creating vector objects\r\nManaging your timeline\r\nAdding audio\r\nUsing shape and motion tweens\r\nCoding navigation buttons\r\nTesting your animation\r\nPublishing\r\n \nhttp://www.lynda.com/Animate-tutorials/L...046-2.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b07cecb996077a9b9db16a2df30f6293fc34381","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Learn+Adobe+Animate+CC+The+Basics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b07cecb996077a9b9db16a2df30f6293fc34381","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,7,206,203,153,96,119,169,185,219,22,162,223,48,246,41,63,195,67,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
