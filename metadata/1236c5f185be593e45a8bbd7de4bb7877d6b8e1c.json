FIFA 2002 is the ninth game in the FIFA series.\n\nPower bars for passes were introduced, and dribbling reduced in order to attain a higher challenge level. The power bar can also be customised to suit the gamer's preference. The game also includes club emblems for many more European clubs as well as for major Dutch clubs such as PSV, AFC Ajax and Feyenoord, although there was no Dutch league of any kind (they were under the &quot;Rest of World&quot; header). This game also features, for the first time, the Swiss Super League, at the cost of excluding the Greek League. A card reward system licensed from Panini was also introduced where, after winning a particular competition, a star player card is unlocked. There is also a bonus game with the nations that had automatically qualified for the 2002 World Cup (France, Japan and South Korea), in which the player tries to improve the FIFA ranking of their chosen team by participating in international friendlies.\n\nTORRENT STATS: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/bbd7/15baa555e.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/bbd7/15baa555e.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1236c5f185be593e45a8bbd7de4bb7877d6b8e1c","amp;dn":"+FIFA+2002-Full+Version+%5BHunkSmarty%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1236c5f185be593e45a8bbd7de4bb7877d6b8e1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,54,197,241,133,190,89,62,69,168,187,215,222,75,183,135,125,107,142,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
