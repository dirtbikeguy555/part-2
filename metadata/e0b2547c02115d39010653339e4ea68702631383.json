Finally!&quot;. Imagine you could wave a magic wand and all your debts and payments disappeared. You have complete and total financial independence and truckloads of passive income coming in every month. You live in the house of your dreams, drive the car you've always wanted and your family is safe and secure.\n\n\nNow, what if I told you that this program is your magic wand -- it can absolutely help you live the life of your dreams.\n\nThe methods and strategies I'll show you in this course are so powerful they will revitalize your finances.\n\nThis might sound too good to be true, or even impossible, but I'm telling the truth.\n\nContrary to what we've been taught, the problem isn't that we don't have enough money. The problem is we don't know how to take care of what we have already. Until we learn how, more money will never be enough.\n\nWhen you learn these life changing techniques you will finally become financially independent using the money you already make today.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0b2547c02115d39010653339e4ea68702631383","amp;dn":"Brian+Tracy%3A+Get+Out+of+Debt+Now%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0b2547c02115d39010653339e4ea68702631383","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,178,84,124,2,17,93,57,1,6,83,51,158,78,166,135,2,99,19,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
