In the study of derivatives, if the level of mathematical sophistication is too high, then the material is likely to be inaccessible to many students and practitioners. But if itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s too low, then some important issues may not get the in-depth explanation they need. To help, this text takes a balanced approach to mathematical sophistication by: \nEliminating nonessential mathematical material or including it in the end-of-chapter appendices and/or technical notes on the website. \nProviding a careful explanation of the concepts that are likely to be new to many readersÃ¢â‚¬â€along with presenting the concepts with many numerical examples.\n\n\nNEW! Cover the credit crisis: New Chapter 8. The new Chapter 8: Securitization and the Credit Crisis of 2007 is entirely devoted to securitization and the credit crisis. The events in the financial markets since the last edition made this update necessary and particularly relevant.\n\nUpdated! Present relevant material:\nChapter 33 now includes increased discussion on the way commodity prices are modeled and commodity derivatives valued.\nChapter 3 has been simplified and contains an appendix explaining the capital asset pricing model.\nChapter 12 contains a new appendix to show that the Black-Scholes-Merton formula can be derived as the limiting case of a binomial tree.\n\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1.
