Consequently, practitioners and students must acquire strong mathematical and statistical backgrounds in order to have successful careers.\nFinancial and Actuarial Statistics: An Introduction, Second Edition enables readers to obtain the necessary mathematical and statistical background. It also advances the application and theory of statistics in modern financial and actuarial modeling. Like its predecessor, this second edition considers financial and actuarial modeling from a statistical point of view while adding a substantial amount of new material.\n\n-Discusses actuarial and financial models and computations from a statistical perspective, developing confidence and prediction intervals for actuarial and financial statistics and using order statistics to introduce multiple life status models\n-Extends conventional treatments of Markov chains and applications to actuarial science by using various models based on life table data to compute survival and decrement probabilities as well as standard actuarial present value expectations\n-Describes modern simulation techniques for analyzing investment pricing, surplus models, and actuarial statistics\n-Includes many new end-of-chapter exercises and problems with solutions\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nStatistical Concepts\nProbability\nRandom Variables\nExpectations\nMoment Generating Function\nSurvival Functions\nNonnegative Random Variables\nConditional Distributions\nJoint Distributions\nStatistical Techniques\nSampling Distributions and Estimation\nSums of Independent Variables\nOrder Statistics and Empirical Prediction Intervals\nApproximating Aggregate Distributions\nCompound Aggregate Variables\nRegression Modeling\nAutoregressive Systems\nModel Diagnostics\nFinancial Computational Models\nFixed Financial Rate Models\nFixed-Rate Annuities\nStochastic Rate Models\nDeterministic Status Models\nBasic Loss Model\nStochastic Loss Criterion\nSingle-Risk Models\nCollective Aggregate Models\nStochastic Surplus Model\nFuture Lifetime Random Variables and Life Tables\nContinuous Future Lifetime\nDiscrete Future Lifetime\nForce of Mortality\nFractional Ages\nSelect Future Lifetimes\nSurvivorship Groups\nLife Models and Life Tables\nLife Table Confidence Sets and Prediction Intervals\nLife Models and Life Table Parameters\nSelect and Ultimate Life Tables\nStochastic Status Models\nStochastic Present Value Functions\nRisk Evaluations\nPercentile Evaluations\nLife Insurance\nLife Annuities\nRelating Risk Calculations\nActuarial Life Tables\nLoss Models and Insurance Premiums\nReserves\nGeneral Time Period Models\nExpense Models and Computations\nAdvanced Stochastic Status Models\nMultiple Future Lifetimes\nMultiple-Decrement Models\nPension Plans\nMarkov Chain Methods\nIntroduction to Markov Chains\nNonhomogeneous Stochastic Status Chains\nHomogeneous Stochastic Status Chains\nSurvivorship Chains\nScenario and Simulation Testing\nScenario Testing\nSimulation Techniques\nInvestment Pricing Applications\nStochastic Surplus Application\nFuture Directions in Simulation Analysis\nFurther Statistical Considerations\nMortality Adjustment Models\nMortality Trend Modeling\nActuarial Statistics\nData Set Simplifications\nAppendix A: Excel Statistical Functions, Basic Mathematical Functions, and Add-Ins\nAppendix B: Acronyms and Principal Sections\nReferences\nSubject Index\nIndex\n\n\nABOUT THE AUTHORS\nDale S.
