Now you can create the kind of natural scene you always wanted right inside Daz Studio. With morphing terrains that span across separate and moving zones, light that tracks through the sky naturally, &quot;true Volume&quot; cylindrical water, and natural atmospheric volume, the world is literally at your fingertips. Worried about how to set up? Terradome 3 comes with 10 preset scenes for instant rendering. TerraDome 3 is easily morphable, with beautiful and accurate lighting. Want to create your own world? The easy-to-use dials allow for you to change your morphing terrain instantly. If you love the vast expanse of nature achieved by great nature photographers, this is the landscape generator for you. Now you can create the kind of render that was once only possible in other, more expensive kinds of software.\r\n\r\nTerraDome 3 is a unique way to incorporate landscape rendering into your Iray projects. This edition has literally been built from the ground up to take full advantage of the Daz Studio Iray Render Engine. What sets the TerraDome 3 apart from static landscape elements? It is a dynamic morphing terrain with reactive terrain shaders, realistic water, and realistic atmosphere. This is the largest and most detailed TerraDome edition to date. Once Poser's most popular product, it is now available ONLY for Daz Studio. Imagine all this, and then.....imagine rendering it with Iray.\r\n\r\nLets look at the â€œpiecesâ€ or Props that make up the TerraDome 3 System:\r\n\r\nThe A Zone: Think of this as the â€œCenter Stageâ€. It is a huge circular mesh that has a number of morph targets to shape it into various styles of terrain. Combined with &quot;Terrain Reactive&quot; shaders it becomes a detailed piece of terrain that you shape to your needs.\r\n\r\nThe B Zone: This is the â€œBackdropâ€ piece â€“ for chunks of terrain that are in the background. distant mountains, steppes, canyons and more can be made with this piece of terrain.\r\n\r\nWater: The water in TerraDome 3 is a true volume, so the water is not just a flat plane, but a full 3D cylinder that contains the water in the scene. We have included two sets of custom shaders to provide balance between realism and render times.\r\n\r\nAtmosphere: This is a true atmospheric volume that is comprised of a morphing form allowing for a whole range of mists, fog, haze, sand &amp; dust storms.\r\n \nhttp://www.daz3d.com/terradome-3-iray","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c913d1560a500c557f313c4584ea0f62c74b878","amp;dn":"DAZ3D+-+TerraDome+3+Iray","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c913d1560a500c557f313c4584ea0f62c74b878","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,145,61,21,96,165,0,197,87,243,19,196,88,78,160,246,44,116,184,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
