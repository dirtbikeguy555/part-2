Drawing on over 50 years of experience, the authors bring together technical knowledge and industry advice to offer extensive practical guidance on the design, construction and management of transmission lines. The challenging nature of completing a successful transmission line project, capable of functioning in all conditions, is discussed, with emphasis on achieving greater reliability and reduced risk of failure of electricity lines. Taking an international approach, the book details the considerations, methods and outcomes of projects in different parts of the world where the constraints and opportunities of resources, climate and culture are unique","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43bb12b116bcbc2c11f1eca4b2e7d41529ddeea0","amp;dn":"Structural+Engineering+of+Transmission+Lines+%5B2014%5D+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43bb12b116bcbc2c11f1eca4b2e7d41529ddeea0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,187,18,177,22,188,188,44,17,241,236,164,178,231,212,21,41,221,238,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
