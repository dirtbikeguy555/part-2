Jay Leno and David\n    Letterman were both vying for the position, but Leno's tough manager\n    Helen Kushnick got him the spot. In the wake of her 'stepping on the\n    toes' of powerful network executives and 'playing hardball' tactics\n     with guest bookings, she found herself being pushed out of her job as\n     Tonight Show Executive Producer and Jay's manager. Letterman,\n     devastated by his being passed over, brought in superagent Mike Ovitz\n    to negotiate on his behalf, resulting in his move to CBS.\n    \n    DiRECTOR: Betty Thomas\n      WRiTER: Bill Carter, George Armitage\n        CAST: Kathy Bates, John Michael Higgins, Daniel Roebuck\n        \n \n          MORE iNFORMATiON @ http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116835/\n  \n   \n     \n       \n        \n    \n   \n                      \t   N O T E S\n   \n    \n    \n     \n     \n     \n     \n     \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n   \n     \n       \n          \n                                              ASCii PROUDLY DONE BY: fumita","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7cebfc26337379e10b78f9f5d01ad3cbf25c850b","amp;dn":"The.Late.Shift.1996.TV.DVDRip.XviD-SAPHiRE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7cebfc26337379e10b78f9f5d01ad3cbf25c850b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,235,252,38,51,115,121,225,11,120,249,245,208,26,211,203,242,92,133,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
