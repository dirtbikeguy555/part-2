Yet just as the end is near, a mysterious Bondsmage offers Locke an opportunity that will either save him or finish him off once and for all.\n\nMagi political elections are imminent, and the factions are in need of a pawn. If Locke agrees to play the role, sorcery will be used to purge the venom from his bodyÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶though the process will be so excruciating he may well wish for death. Locke is opposed, but two factors cause his will to crumble: JeanÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s imploringÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶and the BondsmageÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s mention of a woman from LockeÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“s past: Sabetha. She is the love of his life, his equal in skill and wit, and now, his greatest rival.\n\nLocke was smitten with Sabetha from his first glimpse of her as a young fellow orphan and thief-in-training. But after a tumultuous courtship, Sabetha broke away. Now they will reunite in yet another clash of wills. For faced with his one and only match in both love and trickery, Locke must choose whether to fight SabethaÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶or to woo her.
