Here is a rich cornucopia of horror and ghosts stories, science fiction and fairy tales, fabulism and poetry that explore the realm of experience and emotion. In Adventure StoryÃ¢â‚¬â€a thematic companion to The Ocean at the End of the LaneÃ¢â‚¬â€Gaiman ponders death and the way people take their stories with them when they die. His social media experience A Calendar of Tales are short takes inspired by replies to fan tweets about the months of the yearÃ¢â‚¬â€stories of pirates and the March winds, an igloo made of books, and a MotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Day card that portends disturbances in the universe. Gaiman offers his own ingenious spin on Sherlock Holmes in his award-nominated mystery tale The Case of Death and Honey. And Click-Clack the Rattlebag explains the creaks and clatter we hear when weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re all alone in the darkness.\n\nA sophisticated writer whose creative genius is unparalleled, Gaiman entrances with his literary alchemy, transporting us deep into the realm of imagination, where the fantastical becomes real and the everyday incandescent. Full of wonder and terror, surprises and amusements, Trigger Warning is a treasury of delights that engage the mind, stir the heart, and shake the soul from one of the most unique and popular literary artists of our day","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f522131cac2fea093c84d48447a34a55f42b142","amp;dn":"Trigger+Warning+-+Short+Fictions+and+Disturbances+-+Neil+Gaiman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f522131cac2fea093c84d48447a34a55f42b142","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,82,33,49,202,194,254,160,147,200,77,72,68,122,52,165,95,66,177,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
