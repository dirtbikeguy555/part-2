Born in New York on May 26, 1964 (his mother was actress Roxie Roker, best-known for her role as Helen Willis on the popular TV series The Jeffersons, and his father was a TV producer), Kravitz was raised in Los Angeles, where he found himself around countless musical giants as a youngster due to his parents friendships with the likes of Duke Ellington, Sarah Vaughan, Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, Bobby Short, and Miles Davis. Kravitz was a member of the California Boys Choir until his teenage years, when he decided to pursue rock &amp; roll while in high school and under the heavily influence of funk rocker Prince. Kravitz's admiration of the Purple One was so great that he at first patterned his style and approach directly after Prince and became known as &quot;Romeo Blue&quot; (complete with blue contact lenses), but failed to land a recording contract\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Love Revolution\n02.Are You Gonna Go My Way\n03.Fly Away\n04.Lady\n05.Bring It On\n06.Can't Get You Off My Mind\n07.It Ain't Over 'Til It's Over\n08.I'll Be Waiting\n09.Rock And Roll Is Dead\n10.If I Could Fall In Love\n11.California\n12.Stand By My Woman\n13.Stillness Of Heart\n14.Black Velveteen\n15.This Moment Is All There Is\n16.Let Love Rule\n17.Always On The Run\n18.I Belong To You\n19.My Precious Love\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.American Woman\n02.Love Love Love\n03.Again\n04.Circus\n05.Will You Marry Me\n06.I Build This Garden For Us\n07.If You Can't Say No\n08.I Want To Go Home\n09.Mr.Cab Driver\n10.Believe\n11.I Love The Rain\n12.Lonely Rainbows (With Vanessa Paradis)\n13.A Million Miles Away\n14.If You Want It\n15.Where Are We Runnin'\n16.Believe In Me\n17.What Goes Around Comes Around\n18.Fields Of Joy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        ****You Don't Have To Thank Me.
