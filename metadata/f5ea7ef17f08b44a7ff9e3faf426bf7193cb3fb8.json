Use your favorite burning program to create your disc. If you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have one, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d recommend ImgBurn as simple and easy to use.\n\nIf you want the files on your computer and arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sure how to get them there without burning the DVD first, look up Daemon tools. This can be used to mount the iso file as a virtual drive on your computer, from which you can rip and convert as normal. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5ea7ef17f08b44a7ff9e3faf426bf7193cb3fb8","amp;dn":"Insanity+disc+6+Core+Cardio+%26amp%3B+Balance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5ea7ef17f08b44a7ff9e3faf426bf7193cb3fb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,234,126,241,127,8,180,74,127,249,227,250,244,38,191,113,147,203,63,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
