The Henry Claridge murder from that issue and the details are similar but the approach is fresh and the art by Doug Mahnke is a wonder to behold. What Brubaker really accomplishes is to delve deep in the mind of Batman's nemesis and explore his psyche. Batman also seems to discover a trail into the background and creation of the Joker and it is heavily implied here that Batman may have been ultimately responsible for his greatest enemy. This is also a direct follow-up to Batman: Year One, and should not be missed if you are a fan of the Dark Knight.\n\nThis digital copy is by Zone-Empire and looks fantastic. This was previously packed in a massive torrent by STFMaryville but I have fixed the title to be correct as well as pirating it separately to make it easier to find. Full credit to the scanners and original uploaders, please seed and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83f0fffc13b5621deaf7d1382e640efce9a75f6c","amp;dn":"Batman+-+The+Man+Who+Laughs+%282005%29+%28Digital%29+%28Zone-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83f0fffc13b5621deaf7d1382e640efce9a75f6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,240,255,252,19,181,98,29,234,247,209,56,46,100,14,252,233,167,95,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
