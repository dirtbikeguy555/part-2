(2003)\n\nWith their angst-filled hybrid of Van Morrison, the Band, and R.E.M., Counting Crows became an overnight sensation in 1994. Only a year earlier, the band was a group of unknown musicians, filling in for the absent Van Morrison at the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame ceremony; they were introduced by an enthusiastic Robbie Robertson. Early in 1993, the band recorded their debut album, August and Everything After, with T-Bone Burnett. Released the fall, it was a dark and somber record, driven by the morose lyrics and expressive vocals of Adam Duritz. The only up-tempo song, &quot;Mr. Jones,&quot; became their ticket to stardom, and Counting Crows enjoyed a significant amount of success throughout the '90s and beyond. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\n\n01.Angels Of The Silences\n02.Round Here\n03.Rain King\n04.A Long December\n05.Hanginaround\n06.Mrs. Potter's Lullaby\n07.Mr. Jones\n08.Recovering The Satellites\n09.American Girls\n10.Big Yellow Taxi\n11.Omaha\n12.Friend Of The Devil\n13.Einstein On The Beach (For An Eggman)\n14.Anna Begins\n15.Holiday In Spain\n16.She Don't Want Nobody Near\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01b01256159759fc4e52aff32158a0f9dc090fd5","amp;dn":"Counting+Crows+-+The+Best+Of+%282003%29+%5BCD+Rip%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01b01256159759fc4e52aff32158a0f9dc090fd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,176,18,86,21,151,89,252,78,82,175,243,33,88,160,249,220,9,15,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
