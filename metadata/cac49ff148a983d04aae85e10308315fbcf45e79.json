PDF became the file format of choice \r\nfor businesses thanks to its cross platform flexibility and \r\nsecurity capabilities.\r\n\r\nSimple UI:\r\n\r\nAdobe Readerâ€™s UI is simple and intuitive. \r\nClassic tools (text selection, zoom, snapshots, find, etc.) \r\ncan be accessed from the top navigation menu and buttons. \r\nThe latest version also includes advanced Tools (create, export, \r\nsend and store options), Sign and Comment features. \r\nYou can share iterations, comments and signatures \r\nby email or using the Adobe SendNow service.\r\n\r\nSecurity:\r\nAdobe Reader XI is the safest version Adobe have released. \r\nThis is mainly due the new Protected Mode \r\nwhich loads potentially hazardous items and \r\ncode in a sandboxed area, isolated from the rest of your system.\r\n\r\nSpeed:\r\nThere have been some criticisms over Adobe Readerâ€™s speed \r\ncompared to other lightweight PDF readers. Itâ€™s true; \r\nAdobe Reader does have more plugins and extensions than \r\nmost PDF readers which can slow operation. \r\nThat being said the difference for the average user \r\nis negligible and those add-ons can be disabled if they \r\nare not required. In terms of general operation, \r\nAdobe Reader renders documents with high detail \r\nand true colour reproduction quickly. Later editions \r\nhave also had work done to improve Adobe Readerâ€™s \r\nimpact on memory usage so you should find \r\nmultitasking takes less strain on your system.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy,\r\nSeven7i :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cac49ff148a983d04aae85e10308315fbcf45e79","amp;dn":"Adobe+Reader+11.0.13+en_US+Final+Nov2015+Seven7i","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cac49ff148a983d04aae85e10308315fbcf45e79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,196,159,241,72,169,131,208,74,174,133,225,3,8,49,95,188,244,94,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
