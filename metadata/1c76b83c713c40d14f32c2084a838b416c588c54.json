The band was centered around Fergus &amp; Geronimo songwriter Andrew Savage, and also included guitarist Austin Brown, bassist Sean Yeaton, and drummer Max Savage. Much like in Teenage Cool Kids, the band Andrew Savage still split his time with back in his hometown of Denton, Texas, Parquet Courts produced noisy indie rock with jagged punk edges borrowed from late-'90s guitar-heavy alternative acts. The band played often in the greater New York area and released its first album, American Specialties, exclusively on cassette in late 2011. A more widely distributed full-length, Light Up Gold, was issued on the Dull Tools label in the summer of 2012, and the band's first U.S. tour followed by the end of the year. Light Up Gold quickly caught on and was reissued on Brooklyn label What's Your Rupture? in early 2013 to wider distribution. A five-song EP entitled Tally All the Things That You Broke showed up later that year after Parquet Courts made an international impression with constant touring and glowing press for their debut album. At the beginning of 2014, they announced that a second album, Sunbathing Animal, was forthcoming.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c76b83c713c40d14f32c2084a838b416c588c54","amp;dn":"Parquet+Courts+-+Sunbathing+Animal+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c76b83c713c40d14f32c2084a838b416c588c54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,118,184,60,113,60,64,209,79,50,194,8,74,131,139,65,108,88,140,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
