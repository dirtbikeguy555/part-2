Brand new to the LIR arsenal, it tells the story of who we are, how we live, and, ultimately, how we die. By first identifying organ function and then showing how cells and tissues are designed to fulfill that function, LIR Physiology decodes this discipline like no other text or review book. Each element was tailored for ease of use and fast content absorption, all combining to bring this story to life for readers. Visionary artwork, Clinical Applications, and Unit Review Questions teach and reinforce the most essential concepts in physiologyÃ¢â‚¬â€perfect for classroom learning and test/boards preparation!\n\nFeatures:\nMore than 600 lively, full-color illustrations, the hallmark of the LIR series, painstakingly, and often humorously (watch for the jokes!), guide readers step by step through complex processes.\n\nOverviews and Chapter Summaries set clear goals for topic mastery and reemphasize essential concepts from each chapter in a coherent framework.\nClinical Applications boxes and clinical images encourage readers to apply their knowledge, taking them from the classroom to the bedside.\nMargin Example Equation boxes and in-text boxes highlight memorable information and keep physiology in a real-world context.\nConsistent outline format makes critical information easy to access and assimilate.\nCross references and Infolinks to topics within this book are keyed to page headers to expedite location and are also provided for topics in other LIR books for an interdisciplinary grasp of key concepts.\nUnit-review questions in board-review style test understanding of fundamental concepts as well as the ability to draw connections among multiple organ systems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82ff05c6aee53915a2e3371bd7f60320b52f9e4b","amp;dn":"Lippincott%27s+Illustrated+Reviews+Physiology+%5BEpub%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82ff05c6aee53915a2e3371bd7f60320b52f9e4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,255,5,198,174,229,57,21,162,227,55,27,215,246,3,32,181,47,158,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
