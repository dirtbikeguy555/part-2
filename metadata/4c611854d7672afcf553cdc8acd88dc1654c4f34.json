Nirvana went through a succession of drummers, the longest-lasting being Dave Grohl, who joined the band in 1990.\n\n\nWith the lead single &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; from the group's second album Nevermind (1991), Nirvana entered into the mainstream, bringing along with it a subgenre of alternative rock called grunge. Other Seattle grunge bands such as Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden also gained popularity, and, as a result, alternative rock became a dominant genre on radio and music television in the United States during the early-to-middle 1990s.\n\nAs Nirvana's frontman, Kurt Cobain found himself referred to in the media as the &quot;spokesman of a generation&quot;, with Nirvana the &quot;flagship band&quot; of &quot;Generation X&quot;.Cobain was uncomfortable with the attention and placed his focus on the band's music, challenging the band's audience with its third studio album In Utero (1993).\nNirvana's brief run ended with Cobain's death in April 1994, but the band's popularity continued in the years that followed. In 2002, &quot;You Know You're Right&quot;, an unfinished demo from the band's final recording session, topped radio playlists around the world. Since their debut, the band has sold over fifty million albums worldwide.\n\nNirvana are often credited with being one of the most popular and important rock bands of recent years.Cobain and Novoselic met in 1985. Both were fans of the Melvins, and frequented the band's practice space. After a couple of false starts at forming their own band, the duo recruited drummer Aaron Burckhard, creating the first incarnation of what would eventually become Nirvana. Cobain later described the sound of the band when they first started as &quot;a Gang of Four and Scratch Acid ripoff.\n\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\nCD 1\n\n01 Serve the Servants\n02 Scentless Apprentice\n03 Heart Shaped Box\n04 Rape Me\n05 Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle\n06 Dumb\n07 Very Ape\n08 Milk It\n09 Pennyroyal Tea\n10 Radio Friendly Unit Shifter\n11 Tourette's\n12 All Apologies\n13 Gallons of Rubbing Alcohol Flow Through the Strip\n14 Marigold (B-Side)\n15 Moist Vagina (2013 Mix)\n16 Sappy (2013 Mix)\n17 I Hate Myself and Want To Die (2013 Mix)\n18 Pennyroyal Tea (Scott Litt Mix)\n19 Heart Shaped Box (Steve Albini 1993 Mix)\n20 All Apologies (Steve Albini 1993 Mix)\n\nCD 2\n\n01 Serve the Servants (2013 Mix)\n02 Scentless Apprentice (2013 Mix)\n03 Heart Shaped Box (2013 Mix)\n04 Rape Me (2013 Mix)\n05 Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle (2013 Mix)\n06 Dumb (2013 Mix)\n07 Very Ape (2013 Mix)\n08 Milk It (2013 Mix)\n09 Pennyroyal Tea (2013 Mix)\n10 Radio Friendly Unit Shifter (2013 Mix)\n11 Tourette's (2013 Mix)\n12 All Apologies (2013 Mix)\n13 Scentless Apprentice (Demo)\n14 Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle (Demo - Instrumental)\n15 Dumb (Demo - Instrumental)\n16 Very Ape (Demo - Instrumental)\n17 Pennyroyal Tea (Demo - Instrumental)\n18 Radio Friendly Unit Shifter (Demo - Instrumental)\n19 Tourette's (Demo - Instrumental)\n20 Marigold (Demo)\n21 All Apologies (Demo)\n22 Forgotten Tune (Demo - Instrumental)\n23 Jam (Demo)\n\nCD 3\n\n01 Radio Friendly Unit Shifter\n02 Drain You\n03 Breed\n04 Serve the Servants\n05 Rape Me\n06 Sliver\n07 Pennyroyal Tea\n08 Scentless Apprentice\n09 All Apologies\n10 Heart Shaped Box\n11 Blew\n12 The Man Who Sold the World\n13 School\n14 Come As You Are\n15 Lithium\n16 About a Girl\n17 Endless, Nameless\nAnd there that is Its to bad that he loved the Heroin so much but then he was never known to do anything in moderation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c611854d7672afcf553cdc8acd88dc1654c4f34","amp;dn":"Nirvana+In+Utero+20th+Anniversary+Super+Deluxe+Edition+3-CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c611854d7672afcf553cdc8acd88dc1654c4f34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,97,24,84,215,103,42,252,245,83,205,200,172,216,141,193,101,76,79,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
