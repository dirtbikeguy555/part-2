Nishi (Takeshi Kitano) is a policeman whose emotions seem to run only on two extreme paths -- either quiet contentment or brutal rage. Nishi's life is falling apart around him; his daughter was murdered, his wife, Miyuki (Kayoko Kishimoto), is dying of leukemia, his partner, Horibe (Ren Osugi), was ambushed by thugs after Nishi left him to visit his wife in the hospital and will now spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair, and another cop was killed coming to Horibe's rescue. Nishi desperately wants to quit his job so he can spend more time with his dying wife, so he borrows a large sum of money from the yakuza (the Japanese mafia) and takes up a career as a painter while he cares for Miyuki. Not wanting to stay in debt to the gangsters, Nishi engineers a daring bank robbery (using his police uniform and an old auto disguised to look like a squad car) and uses the loot to pay off the yakuza and take his wife on a final vacation. However, the loan sharks are not eager to have Nishi off the hook, and they begin complaining that he still owes them interest on their loan.\n   \n  General\n      Complete name : Hana-bi.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 43mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 892 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : No\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Custom\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 43mn\n      Bit rate : 1 501 Kbps\n      Width : 672 pixels\n      Height : 384 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 16:9\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.243\n      Stream size : 1.09 GiB (79%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 43mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 384 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 6 channels\n      Channel positions : Front: L C R, Surround: L R, LFE\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 284 MiB (20%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 96 ms (2.30 video frames)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 96 ms\n      Language : Japanese\n\nIMDB: tt0119250\n\nJapanese audio; English, French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nRip by Tagave (KG)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfbad25a70c4f07c8a568f0346e63afe9df31733","amp;dn":"Hana-bi+%281997%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfbad25a70c4f07c8a568f0346e63afe9df31733","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,186,210,90,112,196,240,124,138,86,143,3,70,230,58,254,157,243,23,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
