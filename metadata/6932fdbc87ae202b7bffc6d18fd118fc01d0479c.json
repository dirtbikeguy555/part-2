What is it like to leave the comfort of your own home and fly in a helicopter to work in the middle of the sea? What does it feel like to work 12-hour shifts for 14 days straight, with no days off and away from family? We experience it through the eyes of those who work there. From drillers to deckhands, caterers to controllers, this is an honest look into what it feels like to work offshore on the largest North Sea oil platform, Buzzard, and on the newest platform in the North Sea, Golden Eagle.\n\nThrough this unique access, we get a fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpse into an often secretive\nworld that is inaccessible to most of us. Over 70% of the UK's primary energy comes from oil and gas, and we meet some of the men and women whose job it is to work in this hostile and challenging environment.\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x265/HEVC CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;773a161e19373b445947&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 20 (~1000Kbps)\nVideo Resolution: 832x468\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nFrame Rate: 25 FPS\nAudio Codec: HE-AACv2\nAudio Bitrate: 24Kbps ABR 24/48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2 (Gaelic)\nRun-Time: 58 mins\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 460 MB\nSource: PDTV","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6932fdbc87ae202b7bffc6d18fd118fc01d0479c","amp;dn":"BBC.Life.Offshore.PDTV.x264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6932fdbc87ae202b7bffc6d18fd118fc01d0479c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,50,253,188,135,174,32,43,123,255,198,209,143,209,24,252,1,208,71,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
