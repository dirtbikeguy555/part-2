The detail on it looks like a screener, but then now and again you see a border on the left side appear and then disappear and also on the end credits you can see a pulse on the yellow background ... which neither of then some be one a screener but are more often or not found on cams ...\nAnyway we've tagged it how the source we used was which was a 5.20gig 720p mp4 file so ...\n\nWell work done for this we fixed the AR because it was slightly off and made a script tweaking the colours, brightness, contrast etc slightly and also we've resized it to 720 x down from 1280 x\nThe audio was ok but lacked bass so dropped it in goldwave and added some more bass to it, to give it some depth. Once done it was a case of syncing it, which was a bitch to do ... some major jumps in the audio gaps, ranging from 500 - 11700ms. So we did our best and we've scrolled through and didn't see any oos parts,but if there is ... hey sorry.\n\nAnyway retail should be out soon but until then, enjoy :)\n\ncredit IMAGiNE &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nBIG BIG BIG GREETZ &amp; THANKS:\nALL members &amp; STAFFS of PIRATEBAY, EXTRATORRENT, KINGDOM, DEMONOID &amp; AHASHARE :)\nKaOsUSC, Motley Crue, InFeCtiouS, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, UniversalAbsurdity, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld, wrath, oziman, rubak1, BigPerm1828, skynetcentral, IZON, bluepeas, extremezone, Dibya9999, Treezluv2draw, pitic &amp; many more :)\nALL the awesome people who are SHARING (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY, even the CRITICIZERS )\n***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****\n\nSCREENSHOTS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/DRAGON%20480p/vlcsnap-449888.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/DRAGON%20480p/vlcsnap-449888.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/DRAGON%20480p/vlcsnap-450174.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/DRAGON%20480p/vlcsnap-450174.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/DRAGON%20480p/vlcsnap-450341.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/DRAGON%20480p/vlcsnap-450341.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/DRAGON%20480p/vlcsnap-450656.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imagine.takagari.com/DRAGON%20480p/vlcsnap-450656.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDON'T THANK ME...HELP SOMEONE IN NEED :)\n\nMAY YOU &amp; YOUR LOVED ONES ALWAYS BE BLESSED WITH LIGHT, LOVE, JOY, PEACE, GOOD HEALTH &amp; ABUNDANCE :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:218383a56336f97fd4349f21d9cd15c9b811afb1","amp;dn":"How+To+Train+Your+Dragon+2-D+HDTV+480p+RiP+READNFO+XViD+-+IMAGiN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"218383a56336f97fd4349f21d9cd15c9b811afb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,131,131,165,99,54,249,127,212,52,159,33,217,205,21,201,184,17,175,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
