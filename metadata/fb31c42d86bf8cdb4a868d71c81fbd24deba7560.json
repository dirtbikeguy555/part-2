All she needs to do is make it to her classes on time, make sure the bracelet on her left wrist stays in place, not draw any attention to herself, and maybeÃ¢â‚¬â€please GodÃ¢â‚¬â€make a few friends, because surely that would be a nice change of pace. The one thing she didn't need and never planned on was capturing the attention of the one guy who could shatter the precarious future sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s building for herself.\n\nSome things are worth experiencingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nCameron Hamilton is six feet and three inches of swoon-worthy hotness, complete with a pair of striking blue eyes and a remarkable ability to make her want things she believed were irrevocably stolen from her. She knows she needs to stay away from him, but Cam is freaking everywhere, with his charm, his witty banter, and that damn dimple thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just soÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ so lickable. Getting involved with him is dangerous, but when ignoring the simmering tension that sparks whenever they are around each other becomes impossible, he brings out a side of her she never knew existed.\n\nSome things should never be kept quietÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nBut when Avery starts receiving threatening emails and phone calls forcing her to face a past she wants silenced, she has no other choice but to acknowledge that someone is refusing to allow her to let go of that night when everything changed. When the devastating truth comes out, will she resurface this time with one less scar? And can Cam be there to help her or will he be dragged down with her?\n\nAnd some things are worth fighting for\nISBN: 2940016231921 \n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb31c42d86bf8cdb4a868d71c81fbd24deba7560","amp;dn":"Wait+For+You+by+J.+Lynn+%7BPDF%2C+EPUB%2C+MOBI%7D+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb31c42d86bf8cdb4a868d71c81fbd24deba7560","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,49,196,45,134,191,140,219,74,134,141,113,200,31,189,36,222,186,117,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
