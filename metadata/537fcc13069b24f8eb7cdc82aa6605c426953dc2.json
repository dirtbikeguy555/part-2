The application itself injects a SLIC (System Licensed Internal Code) into your system before Windows boots; this is what fools Windows into thinking it's genuine.\n\n\nFeatures\n\n    Can be run as a standalone application\n    Works well with all system languages\n    Custom OEM information can be installed\n    Argument support for silent installs\n    Can be used for pre-activation\n    Application integrity checking\n    Custom error handling\n    Support for hidden partitions and complex setups\n    Can work alongside Linux's GRUB or any other boot manager\n    Works with TrueCrypt and many other types of hard drive encryption applications\n    Add your own certificates and serials externally\n    Offers certificate and serial installation only for users with an existing SLIC 2.1\n    Automated system profiling (The application matches everything up for you)\n\n\nThe rundown\n\n    Compatible with Windows 7 SP1 and all system updates ÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€œÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ check\n    Will run on x86 and x64 systems ÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€œÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ check\n    No core system files get modified ÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€œÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ check\n    No extra processes are run so you have nothing eating at your RAM ÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€œÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ check\n    All key parts of the exploit are encrypted with a custom encryption ÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€œÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ check\n    The exploit runs before Windows so it's harder for Microsoft to prevent ÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€œÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ check\n    The exploit patches all necessary tables making activation look authentic ÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€œÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ check\n    The application will select the best profile for your system during installation ÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€œÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ check\n    Each and every user has a unique version of the exploit installed on his/her system ÃƒÂ¢Ã…â€œÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ check\n\n\nSupported operating systems\n\n    Windows 7 Ultimate\n    Windows 7 Ultimate E\n    Windows 7 Professional\n    Windows 7 Professional E\n    Windows 7 Home Premium\n    Windows 7 Home Premium E\n    Windows 7 Home Basic\n    Windows 7 Starter\n    Windows 7 Starter E\n    Windows Vista Ultimate\n    Windows Vista Business\n    Windows Vista Business N\n    Windows Vista Home Premium\n    Windows Vista Home Basic\n    Windows Vista Home Basic N\n    Windows Vista Starter\n    Windows Server 2008 R2: Enterprise\n    Windows Server 2008 R2: Standard\n    Windows Server 2008 R2: Foundation\n    Windows Server 2008: Enterprise\n    Windows Server 2008: Standard\n    Windows Server 2008: Foundation\n    Windows Small Business Server 2008\n\nNote: You must be running build 7600 or greater for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.\nNote: I don't recommend using any of the Windows 7 E editions.\nNote: Windows 7 N editions will only be supported when OEM SLP serials leak.\n\n\nApplication integrity checking?\n\nHover your mouse over the green, amber or red icon to see detailed application information.\n\nNote: Even if the icon is green someone might have found a way around the protection system so it's worth checking that the applications path is always the same as the location from which you launched the application. You should also check that the MD5 matches the MD5 found online.\n\n\nVirus scanner results\n\nAll virus scanner detection's are a false-positive. Simply turn off your anti-virus while installing the loader.\n\n\n--\nVersion 2.0.1 (05/09/2011)\n* Added a new GRLDR version\n* Added TAROX and Vestel SLIC's\n* Added Positivo and Kraftway Home Basic serials\n* Enhanced the installation of GRLDR\n* Enhanced the dump option so that it will now dump the certificate and serial as well as the SLIC\n* Other minor tweaks and fixes\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:537fcc13069b24f8eb7cdc82aa6605c426953dc2","amp;dn":"Windows+Seven+7+Loader+v2.01+DAZ+Genuine+Crack+-+DeGun","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"537fcc13069b24f8eb7cdc82aa6605c426953dc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,127,204,19,6,155,36,248,235,124,220,130,170,102,5,196,38,149,61,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
