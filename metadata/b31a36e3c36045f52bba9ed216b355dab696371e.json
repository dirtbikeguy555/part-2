A double album telling a loose story about a &quot;deaf, dumb and blind boy&quot; who becomes the leader of a messianic movement, Tommy was the first musical work to be billed overtly as a rock opera. Released in 1969, the album was mostly composed by Pete Townshend. In 1998 it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for &quot;historical, artistic and significant value&quot;. It has sold over 20 million copies worldwide.\n\nTOMMY DELUXE EDITION [320k MP3]\n\nDISC 1\n\n\t&quot;Overture&quot;   \t3:50\n \t&quot;It's a Boy&quot;   \t2:07\n \t&quot;1921&quot;   \t3:14\n \t&quot;Amazing Journey&quot;   \t3:25\n \t&quot;Sparks&quot;   \t3:45\n \t&quot;Eyesight to the Blind (The Hawker)&quot; (Sonny Boy Williamson II) \t2:15\n \t&quot;Christmas&quot;   \t5:30\n \t&quot;Cousin Kevin&quot; (John Entwistle) \t4:03\n \t&quot;The Acid Queen&quot;   \t3:31\n \t&quot;Underture&quot;   \t9:55\n \t&quot;Do You Think It's Alright?&quot;   \t0:24\n \t&quot;Fiddle About&quot; (Entwistle) \t1:26\n \t&quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;   \t3:50\n \t&quot;There's a Doctor&quot;   \t0:25\n \t&quot;Go to the Mirror!&quot;   \t3:50\n \t&quot;Tommy Can You Hear Me?&quot;   \t1:35\n \t&quot;Smash the Mirror&quot;   \t1:20\n \t&quot;Sensation&quot;   \t2:32\n \t&quot;Miracle Cure&quot;   \t0:10\n \t&quot;Sally Simpson&quot;   \t4:10\n \t&quot;I'm Free&quot;   \t2:40\n \t&quot;Welcome&quot;   \t4:30\n \t&quot;Tommy's Holiday Camp&quot; (Keith Moon) \t0:57\n \t&quot;We're Not Gonna Take It&quot;  \n\nDISC 2\n\nThe first twelve tracks are out-takes and demos and the last five are stereo-only demos.\n\n    &quot;I Was&quot;  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:17\n    &quot;Christmas&quot; (out-take 3)   ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:43\n    &quot;Cousin Kevin Model Child&quot;  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:25\n    &quot;Young Man Blues&quot; (Version one) (Allison)  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:51\n    &quot;Tommy Can You Hear Me?&quot; (alternate version)   ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:59\n    &quot;Trying to Get Through&quot;  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:51\n    &quot;Sally Simpson&quot; (out-take)  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:09\n    &quot;Miss Simpson&quot;  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:18\n    &quot;Welcome&quot; (Take two)   ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:44\n    &quot;Tommy's Holiday Camp&quot; (band's version)   ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:07\n    &quot;We're Not Gonna Take It&quot; (alternate version)   ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:08\n    &quot;Dogs (Part Two)&quot; (Moon)  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:26\n    &quot;It's a Boy&quot;  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:43\n    &quot;Amazing Journey&quot;  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:41\n    &quot;Christmas&quot;  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:55\n    &quot;Do You Think It's Alright&quot;  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:28\n    &quot;Pinball Wizard&quot;  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:46\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b31a36e3c36045f52bba9ed216b355dab696371e","amp;dn":"The+Who+-+Tommy+%5BDELUXE%5D+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b31a36e3c36045f52bba9ed216b355dab696371e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,26,54,227,195,96,69,245,43,186,158,210,22,179,85,218,182,150,55,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
