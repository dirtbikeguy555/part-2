The effect that would become an integral part of Abbey RoadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s signature sound was initially created at the famed studios in the 1960s to meet the needs of some very special clients: The Beatles.\n\nReel ADT puts the magic of that era in your hands within seconds. Using its intuitive controls, you can advance or push back the doubled signal to achieve genuine, lush-sounding delay and pitch variations. You can also drive each of the signals separately to add beautiful tape saturations.\n\n\n\n\n                  V9 System Requirements\n\nCPU\nIntel Core 2 Duo 2GHz | AMD Athlon 64 or equivalent\n\nRAM\n4 GB\n\nOperating System\nWindows 7 | Windows 8\n\nScreen Resolution\n1024x768 32-bit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        [Installation]\n\n\n\n1.
