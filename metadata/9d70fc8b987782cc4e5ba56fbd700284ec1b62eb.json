Alongside an array of stunning images, youâ€™ll find insightful coverage of everything this country offers: from the Mediterranean beaches that play host to nesting turtles, to the soaring mountain ranges spangled with Alpine flowers, from legendary ancient sites, such as Troy, to the exotic, domed skyline of Byzantine and Ottoman-era Istanbul. Practical advice details how to travel through this vast and varied country. Up-to-date descriptions of the best restaurants, hotels, and shops suit all budgets. And city maps help you navigate the fifteen-million-plus metropolis of Istanbul and other smaller destinations, such as the frontier settlement of Dogubeyazit, in the shadow of biblical Mt.
