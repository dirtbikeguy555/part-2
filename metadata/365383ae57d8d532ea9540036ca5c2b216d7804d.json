Complex subjects are generally easier to draw from photosÃ¢â‚¬â€plus other factors, such as weather, movement, and lighting, can make drawing from life nearly impossible. Children and animals, for example, rarely sit still when you want them to, making it much easier to draw them from photographs. However, many beginning artists arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t confident in their picture-taking skills, or they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know how to translate their photos into drawings. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s where this innovative book comes in! In no time, beginning artists will be drawing animals, people, landscapes, and still lifes that look real enough to reach out and touch!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:365383ae57d8d532ea9540036ca5c2b216d7804d","amp;dn":"How+to+Draw+from+Photographs%3A+Learn+how+to+create+beautiful%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"365383ae57d8d532ea9540036ca5c2b216d7804d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,83,131,174,87,216,213,50,234,149,64,3,108,165,194,178,22,215,128,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
