Initially planned solely as a deluxe reissue of The Fame,\nit was later decided that the release's eight new tracks would also be released as a standalone EP in some territories,\nas Gaga thought the re-release was too expensive and that the albums were each conceptually different,\ndescribing them as yin and yang. A super deluxe edition of The Fame Monster including The Fame and additional merchandise, \nincluding a lock of her wig, was released on December 15, 2009.\n===============================================\n      The Fame Monster (2009) Info\n[________________________________________]\nLady Gaga: www.ladygaga.com/\nReleased: November 18, (2009)\nGenre: Dance, electropop, Pop\nLabel: Streamline, KonLive, Cherrytree Interscope.\nProducer: Ron Fair, Fernando Garibay, Tal Herzberg, Rodney &quot;Darkchild&quot; Jerkins, Lady Gaga, RedOne Teddy, Riley Space Cowboy.\n===============================================\n         The Fame Monster (2009)\n[________________________________________]\nTracklisting:\n____________________(Disc 1)_____________________\n&quot;The Fame Monster&quot;\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n01.- &quot;Bad Romance&quot;\t\n02.- &quot;Alejandro&quot;  \t\n03.- &quot;Monster&quot;\n04.- &quot;Speechless&quot;\t\n05.- &quot;Dance in the Dark&quot;  \t\n06.- &quot;Telephone&quot; (featuring BeyoncÃƒÂ©)\t\n07.- &quot;So Happy I Could Die&quot;  \t\n08.- &quot;Teeth&quot;  \n____________________(Disc 2)_____________________\n&quot;The Fame&quot;\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\n01.- &quot;Just Dance&quot; (featuring Colby O'Donis)\t\n02.- &quot;LoveGame&quot;  \t\n03.- &quot;Paparazzi&quot;  \t\n04.- &quot;Poker Face&quot;  \t\n05.- &quot;Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)&quot;  \t\n06.- &quot;Beautiful, Dirty, Rich&quot;  \t\n07.- &quot;The Fame&quot;  \t\n08.- &quot;Money Honey&quot;  \t\n09.- &quot;Starstruck&quot; (featuring Space Cowboy and Flo Rida)\t\n10.- &quot;Boys Boys Boys&quot;  \t\n11.- &quot;Paper Gangsta&quot;  \t\n12.- &quot;Brown Eyes&quot;  \t\n13.- &quot;I Like It Rough&quot;  \t\n14.- &quot;Summerboy&quot;  \n==============================================\nGreetz to all our friends from the past to present!!
