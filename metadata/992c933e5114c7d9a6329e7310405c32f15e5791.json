Brimming with AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s funniest stories, one-liners, cartoons, quotes, and jokes, this side-splitting collection explodes the myth that the holidays are the picture of clean homes, well-behaved children, meticulously wrapped gifts, absolutely perfect food, distinguished guests, and perpetual, shiny white smiles. Here is just a sampling of the holiday havoc we all recognizeÃ¢â‚¬â€and love:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Thanksgiving dinners take eighteen hours to prepare. They are consumed in twelve minutes. Half-times take twelve minutes. This is not coincidence.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Erma Bombeck\n\nLast Christmas morning, after all the presents were opened,\n\nit was clear that my five-year-old son wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t thrilled with the ratio\n\nof toys to clothes heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d received. As he trudged slowly up the stairs,\n\nI called out, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hey, where are you going?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“To my room,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“to play with my new socks.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The one thing women donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to find in their stockings on Christmas morning is their husband.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€Joan Rivers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:992c933e5114c7d9a6329e7310405c32f15e5791","amp;dn":"Reader%27s+Digest+-+Laughter+the+Best+Medicine+-+Holidays","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"992c933e5114c7d9a6329e7310405c32f15e5791","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,44,147,62,81,20,199,217,166,50,158,115,16,64,92,50,241,94,87,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
