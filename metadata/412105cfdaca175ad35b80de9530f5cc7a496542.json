Flora and fauna have evolved to cope with this condition.\nIn response to an attack by malevolent entities (known as Voidbringers), the &quot;Almighty&quot; fashions magical weapons and suits of armor, called Shardblades and Shardplates. The &quot;Almighty&quot; equips knights, known as Radiants, with these, and, eventually, the Radiants defeat the evil Voidbringers.\nThen, for unknown reasons, the Radiants turn against mankind, ignoring their cause and vanishing. They leave their Shardplates and Shardblades for all who want them, thus creating wars and strife. The book begins at a phase where warlords have, for many years, been gathering armies around Shardblade-wielding fighters. These armies fight over possession of the remaining Shardblades in an attempt to acquire a decisive advantage.\n\nAuthor.............Brandon Sanderson\nIllustrator........Isaac Stewart, Ben McSweeney, Greg Call\nCover artist.......Michael Whelan\nCountry............United States\nLanguage...........English language\nSeries.............The Stormlight Archive\nGenre(s)...........Epic fantasy\nPublication Date...August 31, 2010 (official, Hardcover; Pages\t1007)\nMedia type.........Mp3\n\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/bizzydawn74/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/bizzydawn74/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:412105cfdaca175ad35b80de9530f5cc7a496542","amp;dn":"Brandon+Sanderson+-+The+Way+of+Kings%3B+Stormlight+Archive","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"412105cfdaca175ad35b80de9530f5cc7a496542","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,33,5,207,218,202,23,90,211,91,128,222,149,48,245,204,122,73,101,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
