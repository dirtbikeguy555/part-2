Two tracks featured on the original pressing, &quot;Passport&quot; and &quot;Visa&quot;, were recorded by Parker, without Gillespie and with a different personnel than that of the other tracks, in March and May 1949.[8] The album was originally issued in 1952 in 10&quot; format as a collection of 78 rpm singles on the Verve subsidiary label Clef Records.\n\nWhile it was produced by Norman Granz, who was known for his preference of large ensembles at the time, the album contains compositions performed with the standard bebop instrumentation of saxophone, trumpet, piano, bass, and drums.\nIn a 1952 four-star review of Bird and Diz, a Down Beat magazine columnist wrote of Granz's contribution to the album's sound, stating &quot;Though there is no mention of bop in Norman Granz'[s] notes, we owe him a salvo for reminding us through this LP that this music is still very much alive.&quot; It serves as the final collaborative studio recording by Parker and Gillespie, and it is also notable for featuring an early appearance of pianist Thelonious Monk. The album has been reissued several times by Verve and PolyGram Records","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f92d089e7e264e35e3b740933436b6a3f9fb08a","amp;dn":"Charlie+Parker+e+Dizzy+Gillespie+-+Bird+and+Diz+%5BEac+Flac+Cue%5D%5BT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f92d089e7e264e35e3b740933436b6a3f9fb08a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,146,208,137,231,226,100,227,94,59,116,9,51,67,107,106,63,159,176,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
