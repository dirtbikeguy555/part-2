Combining outstanding full-color illustrations with integrated coverage of biochemical diseases and clinical information, HarperÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s offers an organization and careful balance of detail and brevity not found in any other text on the subject.\n\n\nFollowing two introductory chapters, the text is divided into six main sections:\nSection I addresses the structures and functions of proteins and enzymes. \nSection II explains how various cellular reactions utilize or release energy and traces the pathways by which carbohydrates and lipids are synthesized and degraded. \nSection III covers the amino acids, their metabolic fates, certain features of protein catabolism, and the biochemistry of the porphyrins and bile pigments.\nSection IV describes the structure and function of nucleotides and nucleic acids, DNA replication and repair, RNA synthesis and modification, protein synthesis, the principles of recombinant DNA technology, and new understanding of how gene expression is regulated. Section V deals with aspects of extracellular and intracellular communication. \nSection VI includes fifteen special topics, ranging from nutrition, digestion and absorption to the biochemistry of aging\n\n\nNew to this edition:\nNew chapters on Aging, Cancer, and Clinical Chemistry\nEvery chapter has been updated to reflect the latest advances in knowledge and technology\nEach chapter now begins with a statement of objectives, followed by a brief discussion of the biomedical importance of topics discussed within the chapter\n250 multiple-choice questions to test your knowledge and comprehension\nIncreased number of tables that encapsulate important information, such as vitamin and mineral requirements\n\nCopyright to the respective owners.If you like this book then please buy it.\nSharing is caring,Seed this torrent so others could enjoy it too.\nAny requests/suggestions can be made in the comments section or via email to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;69041c01080404080d471e0818081b47080b0b081a2905001f0c470a0604&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nThanks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1619406fe321aa1bc22f3ce8235abd4f9cbf744","amp;dn":"Harpers+Illustrated+Biochemistry+%2829th+Edition%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1619406fe321aa1bc22f3ce8235abd4f9cbf744","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,97,148,6,254,50,26,161,188,34,243,206,130,53,171,212,249,203,247,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
