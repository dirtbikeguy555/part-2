Dr. MatÃƒÂ© presents addiction not as a discrete phenomenon confined to an unfortunate or weak-willed few, but as a continuum that runs throughout (and perhaps underpins) our society; not a medical &quot;condition&quot; distinct from the lives it affects, rather the result of a complex interplay among personal history, emotional, and neurological development, brain chemistry, and the drugs (and behaviors) of addiction. Simplifying a wide array of brain and addiction research findings from around the globe, the book avoids glib self-help remedies, instead promoting a thorough and compassionate self-understanding as the first key to healing and wellness. In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts argues persuasively against contemporary health, social, and criminal justice policies toward addiction and those impacted by it. The mix of personal storiesÃ¢â‚¬â€including the authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s candid discussion of his own &quot;high-status&quot; addictive tendenciesÃ¢â‚¬â€and science with positive solutions makes the book equally useful for lay readers and professionals.\n\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 2\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nMode : Dual mono\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 64.0 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 22.05 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cdd186fbe9ade991998f8825ff0f3a850fc10e3","amp;dn":"Gabor+Mate+-+In+the+Realm+of+Hungry+Ghosts+%28Audiobook+%2B+ePub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cdd186fbe9ade991998f8825ff0f3a850fc10e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,221,24,111,190,154,222,153,25,152,248,130,95,240,243,168,80,252,16,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
