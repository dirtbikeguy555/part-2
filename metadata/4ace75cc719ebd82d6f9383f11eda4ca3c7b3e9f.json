It was released on July 14, 1998 through Sanctuary Records, and included the single &quot;Killing Floor&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½released only in Japan. The album draws some inspiration from the works of William Blake - of whom some paintings are featured in the artwork, as well as both sung and spoken excerpts from Blake's prophetic works - although the name of the album and its title track derive from the Rosicrucian manifest the Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz. As with the previous album, it featured Iron Maiden guitarist Adrian Smith, former (and once again current) bandmate of Dickinson.\n\nThe Chemical Wedding [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;King in Crimson&quot;   \t4:43\n02. \t&quot;Chemical Wedding&quot;   \t4:06\n03. \t&quot;The Tower&quot;   \t \t4:45\n04. \t&quot;Killing Floor&quot;   \t4:29\n05. \t&quot;Book of Thel&quot;   \t8:13\n06. \t&quot;Gates of Urizen&quot;   \t4:25\n07. \t&quot;Jerusalem&quot;   \t \t6:42\n08. \t&quot;Trumpets of Jericho&quot;   5:59\n09. \t&quot;Machine Men&quot;   \t5:41\n10. \t&quot;The Alchemist&quot;   \t8:27\n\nBonus Tracks\n\n11. \t&quot;Return of the King&quot;   \t5:06\n12. \t&quot;Real World&quot;   \t \t3:59\n13. \t&quot;Confeos&quot;   \t \t7:35\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    * Bruce Dickinson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ lead vocals\n    * Adrian Smith ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ lead/rhythm guitar, backing vocals\n    * Roy Z ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ lead/rhythm guitar, backing vocals\n    * Eddie Casillas ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ bass guitar\n    * David Ingraham ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ drums, percussion\n    * Arthur Brown ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ voice (&quot;Book of Thel&quot;, &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, &quot;Confeos&quot;)\n    * Greg Schultz ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ keyboards (&quot;Killing Floor&quot;)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ace75cc719ebd82d6f9383f11eda4ca3c7b3e9f","amp;dn":"Bruce+Dickinson+-+%5C%27The+Chemical+Wedding%5C%27+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ace75cc719ebd82d6f9383f11eda4ca3c7b3e9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,206,117,204,113,158,189,130,214,249,56,63,17,237,164,202,60,123,62,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
