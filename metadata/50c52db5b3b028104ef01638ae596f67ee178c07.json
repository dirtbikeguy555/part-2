Intercutting black-and-white archival material of Nazi concentration camps with new color footage of the deserted camps as they existed in 1955, the result is an incredibly powerful and horrifying experience that no fiction film could ever possibly hope to achieve.\n\n\n********************************* FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
