Not even protectors like Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, the Flash, Hawkgirl or the Martian Manhunter may have a chance alone. But together as the Justice League, they are a metahuman force (and a hope) to be reckoned with.&quot;\r\n\r\nJL: UNLIMITED - &quot;Taking up soon after Justice League ended, it features a greatly expanded League, in which the characters from the original seriesâ€”now referred to as &quot;founding members&quot;â€”are joined by many other superheroes from the DC Universe. Most episodes tell a self-contained story, but the series also features extended story arcs, the first involving the building conflict between the League and a secret government agency known as Project Cadmus. This plot line builds upon events that occurred during the second season of Justice League.&quot;\r\n\r\nYOUNG Justice - &quot;In Young Justice, being a teenager means proving yourself over and overto peers, parents, teachers, mentors and, ultimately, to yourself. But what if youre not just a normal teenager? What if youre a teenage super hero? Are you ready to join the ranks of the great heroes and prove youre worthy of the Justice League? Thats exactly what the members of Young Justice: Robin, Aqualad, Kid Flash, Superboy, Miss Martian and Artemiswill find out, whether they have what it takes to be a proven hero. &quot;\r\n\r\n_____________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nName (Title): JUSTICE LEAGUE Series: JL, JL: UNLIMITED, + YOUNG Justice - 720p\r\n\r\nCategory Type: TV Series and Animated Cartoons.\r\n\r\nLength (Duration): 25 Minutes per Episode (roughly).\r\n\r\nYear(s): 2001-2013.\r\n\r\nStarring: Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, etc...\r\n\r\nGenre(s): Action, Adventure, Fantasy, Crime, Suspense, Thriller\r\n\r\nResolution: 720p\r\n\r\nRip Type (Source): WEB-DL\r\n\r\nCodec Type: x264\r\n\r\nFormat of File(s): M4V(s) - MP4(s).\r\n\r\nAudio Format &amp; Language(s): AAC (English).\r\n\r\nSubtitles: No.\r\n\r\nChapters: No.\r\n\r\nIMDB Link(s): \r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275137/\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1641384/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ead8d7ea98159b8ca20a5ef6eca6db32dc0f95df","amp;dn":"JUSTICE+LEAGUE+Series%3A+JL%2C+JL%3A+UNLIMITED%2C+%2B+YOUNG+Justice+-+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ead8d7ea98159b8ca20a5ef6eca6db32dc0f95df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,216,215,234,152,21,155,140,162,10,94,246,236,166,219,50,220,15,149,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
