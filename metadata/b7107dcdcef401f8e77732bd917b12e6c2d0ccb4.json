To date, no graphical version of IDA for Linux has has been leaked, prompting me to get my own copy. The evaluation version is a little buggy and we don't get that nifty decompiler, but most of the functionally was restored making for a fairly competent disassembler/debugger.\n\n-Completely replaced the code that loads the loader modules, removing the PE/ELF/Mach-O limitation.\n-Removed the check restricting which processor modules are allowed.\n-Created a custom loader to re-enable support for loading Binary files.\n-Removed the experation check.\n-Removed the nags when opening and closing projects.\n-Disabled the thread that would open a nag after some time. In the past it would force the program to close, but I guess that was broken in the transition to QT.\n-Removed the checks preventing self-disassembly.\n-Removed a limitation preventing large amounts of data from being copied to the clipboard.\n-Some options were removed from the Help menu for cosmetics.\n\nNo database saving or loading, you have to save your work like this:\nFile-&gt;Produce File-&gt;Dump Database to IDC file...\nTo load it, reload the file your working on, then open your saved IDC to restore your session:\nFile-&gt;Script file...\nThis will work between different versions of IDA so you can use your old databases and move between versions at will.\n\nPics:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/pajnpaAem&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/pajnpaAem&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AAjOAaAEM&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AAjOAaAEM&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KAjjiAaeK&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KAjjiAaeK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KajjhAAEk&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/KajjhAAEk&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nUpdate:\n-Fixed an incompatibility with the OMF and COFF loaders.\n-Disabled settings incompatible with the PPC and SH3 processor modules.\n-Revised the loader patch, it still functions the same.\n-Merged newer sig, til, idc, and ids files from IDA 6.1.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7107dcdcef401f8e77732bd917b12e6c2d0ccb4","amp;dn":"Hex-Rays+IDA+6.3+Linux+REPACK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7107dcdcef401f8e77732bd917b12e6c2d0ccb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,16,125,205,206,244,1,248,231,119,50,189,145,123,18,230,194,208,204,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
