She also had a dream that one day she would be a comedian on TV.\n\nShe has seen both these dreams come true.\n\nAt last, Tina Fey's story can be told. From her youthful days as a vicious nerd to her tour of duty on Saturday Night Live; from her passionately halfhearted pursuit of physical beauty to her life as a mother eating things off the floor; from her one-sided college romance to her nearly fatal honeymoon -- from the beginning of this paragraph to this final sentence.\n\nTina Fey reveals all, and proves what we've all suspected: you're no one until someone calls you bossy.\n\n(Includes Special, Never-Before-Solicited Opinions on Breastfeeding, Princesses, Photoshop, the Electoral Process, and Italian Rum Cake!)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20c22a02aab49df8b6b284fe7b4eee7ad3de6ccd","amp;dn":"Fey_Tina-Bossypants.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20c22a02aab49df8b6b284fe7b4eee7ad3de6ccd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,194,42,2,170,180,157,248,182,178,132,254,123,78,238,122,211,222,108,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
