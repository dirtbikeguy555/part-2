Staying in love is hard. In this heart-pounding follow-up to Tangled by New York Times bestseller Emma Chase, Kate reveals that there is trouble in paradise, when unexpected circumstances force her and Drew to &quot;renegotiate&quot; their relationship.\n\nThere are two kinds of people in the world. The ones who look first, and the ones who leap. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve always been more of a looker. Cautious. A planner. That changed after I met Drew Evans. He was so persistent. So sure of himselfÃ¢â‚¬â€and of me.\n\nBut not all love stories end happily ever after. Did you think Drew and I were going to ride off into the sunset? Join the club. Now I have to make a choice; the most important of my life. Drew already made hisÃ¢â‚¬â€in fact, he tried to decide for the both of us. But you know thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just not my style. So I came back to Greenville, Ohio, alone. Well, sort of alone...\n\nWhat I've come to realize is that old habits die hard, and sometimes you have to go back to where you began before you can move ahead.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:805e2398623d637f3c4e729412388473aeda3e9f","amp;dn":"Twisted+%28Tangled+%232%29+-+Emma+Chase+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"805e2398623d637f3c4e729412388473aeda3e9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,94,35,152,98,61,99,127,60,78,114,148,18,56,132,115,174,218,62,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
