They never even bother to\nstop when they've crashed into something. They don't leap into new worlds so much as \nmaster the old ones, turning Slim Harpo's blues obscurity &quot;Hip Shake&quot; into a\nharp-and-piano steamroller and setting spines a-cracking in &quot;Ventilator Blues.&quot; Both \n&quot;Tumbling Dice&quot; and Keith Richards's &quot;Happy&quot; have become hits, but the 1972 album is \nmost notable for its overall murky adrenaline. --Steve Knopper \n\nRegarded as one of the greatest albums in rock 'n' roll history and one of the most\ndefining of the Stones' catalogue. Upon its release more than three decades ago,\n'Exile on Main Street' innovatively wove varying musical genres, instruments and even\nartists into a compelling rhythmic masterpiece. The original 18-track double-album \nwas recorded in various stages at multiple locations, including Olympic Studios in \nLondon, Keith Richard's mansion Nellcote in France, and in Los Angeles where the\nliteral &quot;Main Street&quot; influenced the album title. These atypical circumstances\nsurrounding the recording process greatly affected the album's outcome which was\nhighly reflective and influenced by the sociopolitical turbulence that marked the\nlate `60s and early `70s. The Stones nixed the influences of a flower-child era and\ndirected their creative process with the edgier, excessive, &quot;more is more&quot; approach\nof the `70s. Exile reveals a sprawling mix of genres with undertones of blues,\ncountry, R&amp;B and gospel mixed with lyrics that fervently demand for release and \nliberation. The 2-CD version is a 3-panel digi-pak, 2xCDs with a 12 page booklet. The\nDigipak is printed in reverse board double white to keep an 'uncoated' feel like the \noriginal LP release. The 2nd disc features 10 tracks originally recorded during the\nExile era including 'Plundered My Soul', 'Dancing in the Light', 'Following the \nRiver' and 'Pass The Wine' plus alternate versions of 'Soul Survivor' and 'Loving\nCup'.\n\nTrack Listing....:\nCD1\n\n01.Rocks off[04:33]\n02.Rip this joint[02:23]\n03.Shake your hips [02:59]\n04.Casino boogie[03:35]\n05.Tumbling dice[03:47]\n06.Sweet virginia[04:27]\n07.Torn and frayed [04:18]\n08.Sweet black angel [02:58]\n09.Loving cup [04:26]\n10.Happy [03:05]\n11.Turd on the run [02:38]\n12.Ventilator blues[03:25]\n13.I just want to see his face [02:53]\n14.Let it loose [05:19]\n15.All down the line [03:50]\n16.Stop breaking down[04:35]\n17.Shine A light[04:17]\n18.Soul survivor[03:49]\n\nCD2\n\n01.Pass the wine[04:54]\n(sophia loren) \n02.Plundered my soul [03:59]\n03.I'm not signifying[03:55]\n04.Following the river[04:52]\n05.Dancing in the light [04:22]\n06.So divine (aladdin story) [04:33]\n07.Loving cup [alternate take] [05:25]\n08.Soul survivor [alternate[03:59]\ntake]\n09.Good time women [03:21]\n10.Title 5 [01:47]\n____ \n\n 108:24 min\n155,1 MB \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b30971e70c5ab30a81e75e9669c77631edbd5477","amp;dn":"The_Rolling_Stones-Exile_On_Main_St-2CD-%28Remastered%29-2010-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b30971e70c5ab30a81e75e9669c77631edbd5477","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,9,113,231,12,90,179,10,129,231,94,150,105,199,118,49,237,189,84,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
