Thats a lot of published material about something so natural. It is also an indication of the breadth of the subject so, as you want to get straight to the heart of your confidence, we have been selective in Building Confidence For Dummies. The task ahead of you is to build your confidence so that you can be more powerful, more engaging, and more at ease in every aspect of your life. These areas include your work and your private life (friends and family, romance, community, and so on). We steer clear of more complex explorations of personalevelopment and except where they translate into immediate practical guidance. You should be able to dip into this book for practical and rapid support on such everyday confidence problems as: \nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Preparing for an important presentation or job interview\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Asking the man or woman of your dreams to marry you\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Picking up the phone to make that difficult call to an important new customer\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Asking for the order, if youre in sales\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œPicking yourself up quickly and appropriately after any setback\nConventions Used in This Book\nTo help you navigate through this book, we set up a few conventions:\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Italics are used for emphasis and to highlight new words or\ndefined terms.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Bold faced text indicates the key concept in a list.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Monofont is used for web and e-mail addresses.\nWhat Youre Not to Read\nThis book is primarily an action guide to building your confidence. In many places, this requires us to set the context you need to grasp the situation. In other places, we include material useful for your full understanding, but not essential for you to be able to take the action and get the benefit. Much as we want you to take all of it on board in time, we make it easy for you to identify those parts that you can leave for later. \nÃ¢â‚¬â€œThe text in the sidebars: The shaded boxes that appear here and there share personal stories and anecdotes, but theyre not integral to your taking action, and you can safely skip reading them if youre not interested.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ The stuff on the copyright page: Youll find nothing here of value unless youre looking for legal notices and reprint information. If you are, then this is the place to look.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:193b06eb6da563a53781e602f0ee7feff75cee56","amp;dn":"Building+Confidence+for+Dummies+-+PDF+-+WD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"193b06eb6da563a53781e602f0ee7feff75cee56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,59,6,235,109,165,99,165,55,129,230,2,240,238,127,239,247,92,238,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
