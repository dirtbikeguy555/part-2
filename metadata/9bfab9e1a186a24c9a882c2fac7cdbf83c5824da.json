World War II veteran Russell Keys is plagued by nightmares of his abduction by aliens during the war; the Roswell incident transforms Owen Crawford from ambitious Air Force captain to evil shadow government conspirator; the unhappily married Sally Clarke is impregnated by an alien visitor. As the decades go by, the heirs of each are affected by the machinations of the aliens, culminating with the birth of Allie Keys, who is the final product of the aliens' experimentation and holds the key to their future.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bfab9e1a186a24c9a882c2fac7cdbf83c5824da","amp;dn":"Taken+%28TV+Mini-Series+2002%29+DVD-RMZ+XviD-Belex+-+Dual+Audio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bfab9e1a186a24c9a882c2fac7cdbf83c5824da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,250,185,225,161,134,162,76,154,136,44,47,172,124,219,248,60,88,36,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
