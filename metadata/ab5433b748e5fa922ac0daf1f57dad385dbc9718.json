Known for its over the top displays of pyrotechnics, world-class artists, costumed theatrical performers, interactive art installations, full scale carnival rides and state-of-the-art lighting and sound production, this year's festival attracted 345,000 attendees from June 21-23, 2013. Shot in IMAX 3D, the film will follow festivalgoers as they prepare for their journey to EDC Las Vegas and chronicle their unique experience throughout the three-day festival. Behind the scenes footage and interviews with key Insomniac team members will give new audiences the chance to discover what has made the Electric Daisy Carnival a global phenomenon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab5433b748e5fa922ac0daf1f57dad385dbc9718","amp;dn":"Under+the+Electric+Sky","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab5433b748e5fa922ac0daf1f57dad385dbc9718","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,84,51,183,72,229,250,146,42,192,218,241,245,125,173,56,93,188,151,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
