They got together in 2007 but didn't release their first material until 2011, when they uploaded a handful of songs -- including the jagged, celebratory &quot;Life of the Party&quot; -- to their Soundcloud page. In 2012, they self-released their first two EPs: Play Hard (June), featuring the reggae-flavored &quot;Killin It,&quot; and Play Harder (December). The former reached number ten on Billboard's Top Dance/Electronic Albums chart. The same year, the trio became a staple of the festival circuit, including New York's Electric Zoo and Texas' Meltdown. 2013 saw the release of the groups first full-length, the bombastic Get Wet. The album spawned several singles and videos, including the sensational underground anthem &quot;Live for the Night.&quot; \n\n\nZedd-\n\nBorn Anton Zaslavski, German producer Zedd broke onto the European electronic scene in 2010 with a remix of Skrillex's &quot;Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites.&quot; Though known for his glitch, pulsing production, Zedd's musical journey began in the acoustic realm. Born into a musical family, the future producer cut his teeth on the piano at four years old and eventually moved to drums and played in a rock band before being drawn into the digital world in 2009. Zedd built a name for himself with his remixes of artists like Lady Gaga, B.o.B, and Armand Van Helden while also releasing his own singles and EPs. In 2012, the young producer delivered his first full-length, Clarity, whose lead single, &quot;Spectrum,&quot; shot to the top of the U.S. dance chart.\n\n\nArtist...............: Krewella &amp; Zedd\nAlbum................: Breaking Point\nGenre................: Electronic\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 2014\nQuality..............: mp3 (CBR 320) Insane\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.Krewella - Live For The Night\n02.Krewella - Play Hard (Explicit Version)\n03.Krewella - Strobelights\n04.Krewella - Alive\n05.Krewella - Alive (Pegboard Nerds Remix)\n06.Krewella - Killin' It\n07.Krewella - Killin' It (Killagraham Remix)\n08.Krewella - Come &amp; Get It\n09.Krewella - Enjoy The Ride\n10.Krewella - One Minute\n11.Krewella - We Are One\n12.Krewella - Can't Control Myself\n13.Krewella - Life Of The Party (Feat.
