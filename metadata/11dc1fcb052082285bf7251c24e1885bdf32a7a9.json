Here, you will hear various South African artists, like Ladysmith Black Mambazo, the Boyoyo Boys, and Baghiti Khumalo; the Everly Brothers; the east L.A. band Los Lobos, the cajun band Good Rockin' Dopsie and the Twisters; and Linda Ronstadt. Listening to this music will take you from the bayou of Louisiana to the heart of Africa.\n\nThe first thing that struck my attention is the use of percussion and accordion. This is the emphasis for the songs rather than the guitar work. The second thing is the blending of Zulu and English lyrics like in the songs &quot;I Know What I Know&quot; and &quot;Homeless.&quot; Both things are a breath of fresh air into Simon's work.\n\nThe two stand-out songs on this album, for me, were &quot;You Can Call Me Al&quot; and &quot;Under African Skies.&quot; The former was very popular on MTV at the time, and in concert, Paul Simon usually played this song twice through the early 1990's. That is just how energetic it is. The latter has Linda Ronstadt who has such a great voice.\nI would highly recommend this album. The rhythm is catchy and will get your toe tapping.[/quote]\n\n[img]https://yuq.me/users/15/891/LCbMvYN92X.jpg[/img]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Paul Simon - Graceland (Warner 46430)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Paul Simon\nAlbum................: Graceland (Warner 46430)\nGenre................: Pop\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1996\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.3.0 20130526\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 56 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.

Many \nare CD's from the 80's which are important to archive because those old CD's \nare at the end of their lifecycles.\n\nThis download includes a volume that has been ripped at MP3 V0 \nwhich is nearly indistinguishable from FLAC using spectral analysis. It provides \nhigher dynamic range than 320kbps at a fraction of the file size. If you love \nFLAC then you'll know MP3 V0 is your other buddy for going mobile when \nspace and quality are a concern\n\nThe AccurateRip data is embedded in the MP3 tags so you can look at any \ntrack to validate the accuracy of the rip.\n\n- Big Papi\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n:: Generated by Music NFO Builder v1.21a - www.nfobuilder.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11dc1fcb052082285bf7251c24e1885bdf32a7a9","amp;dn":"Paul+Simon+-+Graceland+%28Warner+46430%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11dc1fcb052082285bf7251c24e1885bdf32a7a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,220,31,203,5,32,130,40,91,247,37,28,36,225,136,91,223,50,167,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
