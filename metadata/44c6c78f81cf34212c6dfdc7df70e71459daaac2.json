The expensive sound equipment of a recording studio or the stereo in a car or living room is likewise rendered useless if the acoustic environment is not right for them.\nChanges in wavelength to room size ratio and the time difference between the direct and reflected sound at the listening location mean that the acoustics of small spaces are quite different to those of large spaces. Tackling these specific aspects of physics, sound perception, and applications for small spaces, Acoustics of Small Rooms brings together important facets of small room acoustics. Divided into clear sections, it covers:\n-    Sound propagation--the effects of boundaries, sound absorbers and diffusers\n-    Physiology and psychoacoustics\n-    Methods and techniques of room and sound field optimization\n-    Examples of how these principles apply to control rooms, stereo, surround and home theater as well as music practice rooms\n-    Measurement and modeling techniques\n\nAbout the Author\nDr. Mendel Kleiner received his M.Sc.Eng. degree in Electronic Engineering from Chalmers University of Technology, GÃƒÂ¶teborg, Sweden, in 1969 and obtained a Ph.D. in Building Acoustics in 1978. From 1980 to 1995, Mendel Kleiner held a position as lecturer at Chalmers, teaching and doing research on active room acoustics and sound field simulation. In 1989, Dr. Kleiner was awarded the honorary title of 'Docent'. Since 1995 Dr. Kleiner is professor at the Division of Applied Acoustic at Chalmers, continuing research on presence, dynamic sound field simulation, interaction between visual and auditory stimuli in human perception, scattering of sound by architectural objects, product sound quality, auditory icons, and the acoustics of organs and organ pipes.\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface xvii\nAcknowledgment xix\nAuthors xxi\n1 Physics of small room sound fields 1\n2 Sound fields in enclosures 37\n3 Geometrical acoustics 99\n4 Sound absorption in rooms 121\n5 Diffusion 163\n6 The ear 189\n7 Psychoacoustics 201\n8 Spatial hearing 229\n9 Sound reproduction in small rooms 275\n10 Low-frequency sound field optimization 321\n11 Rooms for sound reproduction 335\n12 Small rooms for voice and music practice 359\n13 Modeling of room acoustics 381\n14 Measurement 407\nReferences 449","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44c6c78f81cf34212c6dfdc7df70e71459daaac2","amp;dn":"Acoustics+of+Small+Rooms+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44c6c78f81cf34212c6dfdc7df70e71459daaac2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,198,199,143,129,207,52,33,44,109,253,199,223,112,231,20,89,218,170,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
