In this course, Paul F. Aubin teaches you the core building information modeling (BIM) skills you need to complete solid architectural drawings in Revit 2014. First, get comfortable with the Revit environment, including its context ribbons, property palettes, and views, and learn to set up a project and add the grids, levels, and dimensions that will anchor your design. Then get to modeling: adding walls, doors, and windows; creating and mirroring groups; linking to external assets; and working with floors, roofs, and ceilings. Paul also shows advanced techniques for drawing stairs, complex walls, and partially obscured building elements, as well as adding rooms and solid geometry. Finally, discover how to annotate your drawing so all the components are perfectly understood, and learn how to output sheets to DWF, PDF, or AutoCAD.\nTopics include:\n\n  What is BIM?\n  Understanding Revit element hierarchy\n  Navigating views\n  Creating a new project from a template\n  Refining a layout with temporary dimensions\n  Adding walls, doors, and windows\n  Adding plumbing fixtures and other components\n  Linking AutoCAD DWG files\n  Rotating and aligning Revit links\n  Working with footprint and extrusion roofs\n  Adding openings\n  Adding railings and extensions to stairs\n  Creating stacked and curtain walls\n  Hiding and isolating objects\n  Adding rooms\n  Creating schedule views and tags\n  Adding text and dimensions\n  Creating new families\n  Plotting and creating a PDF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3985029c70cb83db4bd9c5c97cdac418073fd48f","amp;dn":"+-+Revit.Architecture.2014.Essential.Training","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3985029c70cb83db4bd9c5c97cdac418073fd48f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,133,2,156,112,203,131,219,75,217,197,201,124,218,196,24,7,63,212,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
