Academy Award Nominee for Best Foreign Language Film, SOPHIE SCHOLL stars Julia Jentsch in a luminous performance as the young coed-turned-fearless activist. Armed with long-buried historical records of her incarceration, director Marc Rothemund expertly re-creates the last six days of Sophie Scholl?s life: a heart-stopping journey from arrest to interrogation, trial and sentence.\n\nIn 1943, as Hitler continues to wage war across Europe, a group of college students mount an underground resistance movement in Munich. Dedicated expressly to the downfall of the monolithic Third Reich war machine, they call themselves the White Rose. One of its few female members, Sophie Scholl is captured during a dangerous mission to distribute pamphlets on campus with her brother Hans. Unwavering in her convictions and loyalty to the White Rose, her cross-examination by the Gestapo quickly escalates into a searing test of wills as Scholl delivers a passionate call to freedom and personal responsibility that is both haunting and timeless.\n\nSOPHIE SCHOLL received three Lolas (German Oscars) including the Audience Award and Best Actress Award to Jentsch for her brilliant characterization of the title role. The film also won two Silver Bears for Best Director and Best Actress at the 2005 Berlin International Film Festival.\n\n\nI noticed there was no version available with english subtitles. Its a excellent movie and I figured it was about time I gave something back to the great community here at piratebay. \n\nWill seed this for the next few weeks so download with confidence!\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:145cc9a0ee6337cc2fce407f930e7d71842d9272","amp;dn":"Sophie+Scholl-The+Final+Days+%282005%29+DVD-RIP+%5BEng+subtitles%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"145cc9a0ee6337cc2fce407f930e7d71842d9272","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,92,201,160,238,99,55,204,47,206,64,127,147,14,125,113,132,45,146,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
