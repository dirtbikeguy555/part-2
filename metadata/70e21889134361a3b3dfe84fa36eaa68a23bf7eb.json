They have gone through many line-up changes, with singer Bobby &quot;Blitz&quot; Ellsworth and bassist D.D. Verni remaining from the original lineup. Along with Anthrax, whose one-time lead guitarist Dan Spitz was also an early member of Overkill, the band is one of the most successful East Coast thrash metal bands, and they are often called &quot;the MotÃ¶rhead of thrash metal&quot;. The band has a notable mascot named &quot;Chaly&quot;, a skeletal bat with a skull-like face, horns, bony wings and green eyes. Chaly has appeared on most of their album covers.\r\n\r\nTo date, Overkill has released seventeen studio albums, one album of cover songs, three EPs and three live albums. They were one of the early thrash metal bands to sign to a major label (Atlantic Records in 1986), but did not achieve commercial success until the popularization of the genre in the late 1980s, with their contemporaries Anthrax, Exodus, Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer and Testament. The band's most successful records are Under the Influence (1988), The Years of Decay (1989), I Hear Black (1993), The Electric Age (2012), and White Devil Armory (2014), which debuted at No. 142, No. 155, No. 122, No. 77, and No. 31 respectively on the Billboard 200 chart. As of 2006, Overkill has sold over 625,000 albums in the U.S. since the beginning of the SoundScan era and over 16 million records worldwide as of 2012. After some delays, White Devil Armory was finally released on July 22, 2014. The album was their most successful; it peaked at #31 on the Billboard 200, making it Overkill's highest chart position so far.\r\n\r\nOn November 5, 2015, it was announced that Overkill will play a special show on April 16, 2016 in Oberhausen where they will play Feel the Fire and Horrorscope albums in their entirety. The show will be professionally filmed and recorded for an upcoming DVD.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Power In Black (Demo)1983\r\n    Feel the Fire (1985)\r\n    Taking Over (1987)\r\n    Under the Influence (1988)\r\n    The Years of Decay (1989)\r\n    Horrorscope (1991)\r\n    I Hear Black (1993)\r\n    W.F.O.
