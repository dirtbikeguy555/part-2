Originally released on Atlantic Records, this edition of High Voltage has proven popular, selling 3 million units in the United States alone. However, the album was panned by some critics upon its release, including a review by Rolling Stone magazine that called it an &quot;all-time low&quot; for the hard rock genre. It was re-released in 2003 as part of the AC/DC remasters series.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20c1f605c440c6e06074e7743917dbffeebbed8f","amp;dn":"ACDC+-+High+Voltage+%281976%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20c1f605c440c6e06074e7743917dbffeebbed8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,193,246,5,196,64,198,224,96,116,231,116,57,23,219,255,238,187,237,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
