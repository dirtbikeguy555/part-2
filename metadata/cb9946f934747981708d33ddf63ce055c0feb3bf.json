But maybe it wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t such a bad turn of events. Court-martialed and dumped on a reject raft bound for Earth, Cal feels optimistic about a life where getting blown up, shot, or even eaten is altogether less of a concern. And, more importantly, a life where the only person heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s responsible for is himself.\n\nUnfortunately, fate doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t favour the mundane. Crash-landing on a lethal planet, and with technology failing all around him, Cal must take his fellow passengers under his wing in order to survive and unravel the reasons behind their situation.\n\nBut the cause is far worse than any of them could have imagined, for theirs is a small part of a much larger crisis. Colonized space is under attack. Humanity is on the verge of chaos. And those who enjoy such anarchy are already beginning to thrive.\n\n\n\nRead by Alex Wyndham\nFormat: MP3\nBitrate: 64 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb9946f934747981708d33ddf63ce055c0feb3bf","amp;dn":"J.G.+Cressey+-+Star+Splinter+%28Fractured+Space+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb9946f934747981708d33ddf63ce055c0feb3bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,153,70,249,52,116,121,129,112,141,51,221,246,60,224,85,192,254,179,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
