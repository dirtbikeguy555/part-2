McCarthy's fifth book, it was published by Random House.\n\nThe narrative follows a teenage runaway referred to only as &quot;the kid&quot;, with the bulk of the text devoted to his experiences with the Glanton gang, a historical group of scalp hunters who massacred Indians and others in the United StatesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mexico borderlands in 1849 and 1850. The role of antagonist is gradually filled by Judge Holden, a large, intelligent man depicted as entirely devoid of body hair and emblematic of violence and conflict.\n\nAlthough the novel initially generated only lukewarm critical and commercial reception, it has since become highly acclaimed and is widely recognized as McCarthy's masterpiece.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18e6b8632f1762d8e79c22f9d6899414330a5138","amp;dn":"Cormac+Mccarthy+-+The+Blood+Meridian.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18e6b8632f1762d8e79c22f9d6899414330a5138","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,230,184,99,47,23,98,216,231,156,34,249,214,137,148,20,51,10,81,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
