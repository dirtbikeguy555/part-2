Bundled in dark overcoats, they watch over the city with ears open to the heartbeat of the human soul, listening to the internal musings and yearnings of earthbound humans like existential detectives. In these delicate, astounding scenes we float through the thoughts of dozens Berlin citizens, from the weary and worn to the hopeful and young, as the angels record the magic moments for some heavenly record. But when Damiel (the empathic and sensitive Bruno Ganz) falls in love with an angel of another sort, the lonely trapeze artist Marion (willowy, sad-eyed Solveig Dommartin), he gives up the contemplation and observation of life to experience it himself.\n\nWim Wenders's most purely romantic film is like poetry on celluloid, a celebration of the transient and fragile moments of being human: the warmth of a cup of coffee on a cold day, the embrace of a friend, the touch of a lover, the rapture of love. Opening with an angel's-eye view of Berlin in silvery black and white (delicately captured by the great cinematographer Henri Alekan, who photographed Jean Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast 40 years earlier), it transforms into a gauzy color world when Damiel &quot;crosses over&quot; by sheer will. Peter Falk plays himself as a fallen angel with a special sensitivity for celestial visitors (&quot;I can't see you, but I know you're there,&quot; he proclaims), and Otto Sander, whose smiling eyes brighten a face etched by eons of waiting and watching, is Damiel's partner. Wenders made a sequel in 1993, Faraway, So Close, and Hollywood remade the film as City of Angels with Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan.\n\nWings of Desire (Der Himmel ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼ber Berlin) is one of cinema's loveliest city symphonies. Bruno Ganz is Damiel, an angel perched atop buildings high over Berlin who can hear the thoughtsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½fears, hopes, and dreamsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½of all the people living below. But when he falls in love with a beautiful trapeze artist, he is willing to give up his immortality to come back to earth to be with her. Made not long before the fall of the Berlin Wall, this stunning tapestry of sounds and images, shot in black and white and color by the legendary Henri Alekan, is movie poetry. And it forever made the name Wim Wenders synonymous with film art.\n\nRun Time  : 128 minutes\nLanguage  : German\nSubtitles : English Hard Subbed\n\ncredit InFeCtiouS BIG BIG BIG TIME &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53912fe58bdfb1d920a2d38fad9c14c3979e9fad","amp;dn":"Wings+of+Desire+DVDRip+XviD+InFeCtiouS%28ENG+SUBS%29%5BExtraTorrent%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53912fe58bdfb1d920a2d38fad9c14c3979e9fad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,145,47,229,139,223,177,217,32,162,211,143,173,156,20,195,151,158,159,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
