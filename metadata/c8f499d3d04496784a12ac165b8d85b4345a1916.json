Focusing on modern building\ntypes and the forces that shape them, it offers a critical study of more than six hundred buildings by key architects worldwide. Analysing thirteen separate building categories, it traces the pluralist paths of architectural thinking from the seventies to the start of the new millennium. The evolving story of these new forms, with their  underlying quest for aesthetic consensus, is told by HUGH PEARMAN","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8f499d3d04496784a12ac165b8d85b4345a1916","amp;dn":"Contemporary+World+Architecture+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8f499d3d04496784a12ac165b8d85b4345a1916","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,244,153,211,208,68,150,120,74,18,172,22,91,141,133,180,52,90,25,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
