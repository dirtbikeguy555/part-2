Oliver SacksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat tells the stories of individuals afflicted with fantastic perceptual and intellectual aberrations: patients who have lost their memories and with them the greater part of their pasts; patients no longer able to recognize people and common objects; patients stricken with violent tics and grimaces or who shout involuntary obscenities; patients whose limbs have become alien; patients who have been dismissed as retarded yet are gifted with uncanny artistic or mathematical talents. If inconceivably strange, these brilliant tales remain, in Dr. SacksÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s splendid and sympathetic telling, deeply human. They are studies of life struggling against incredible adversity, and they enable us to enter the world of the neurologically impaired to imagine with our hearts what it must be to live and feel as they do. A great healer, Sacks never loses sight of medicineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ultimate responsibility: Ã¢â‚¬Å“the suffering, afflicted, fighting human subject.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nMP3 CD\nPublisher: Brilliance Audio on MP3-CD; MP3 Una edition (October 23, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1455884383\nISBN-13: 978-1455884384\nRead by Jonathan Davis, Oliver Sacks \nFormat: M4A \nBitrate: 64 Kbps \nUnabridged \n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
