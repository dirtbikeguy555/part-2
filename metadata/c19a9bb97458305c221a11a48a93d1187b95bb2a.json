That to really be here now requires practice, like any other skill worth learning? On The Art of Presence, Eckhart Tolle invites you to a six-session audio retreat to teach you how to deepen the moment-to-moment realization of your essential nature -- the unified consciousness that lives in all things.\r\n\r\nOn The Art of Presence, Eckhart guides you through more than seven hours of transformational insights that allow presence to naturally arise in you. With his one-of-a-kind instruction, you will learn how to ground yourself in the vibrancy of your inner body while simultaneously breaking free from the illusion of separation from the outside world, how to connect to the perceiver of all your experiences to realize the wisdom of spiritual surrender, how to access the higher intelligence that empowers right action, and much more","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c19a9bb97458305c221a11a48a93d1187b95bb2a","amp;dn":"Eckhart+Tolle+-+The+Art+of+Presence+%5BMP3+%40+128+kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c19a9bb97458305c221a11a48a93d1187b95bb2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,154,155,185,116,88,48,92,34,26,17,164,138,147,209,24,123,149,187,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
