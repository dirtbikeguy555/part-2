Created by Rory O'Neill, Panti is also an accidental activist and in her own words 'a court jester, whose role is to say the un-sayable'. In recent years, Rory has become a figurehead for LGBT rights in Ireland and since the 2014 scandal around Pantigate, his fight for equality and against homophobia has become recognised across the world.\r\n\r\nOfficial Trailer:\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTheatrical Release Date: 21-Oct-2015\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nResolution: 720 x 404\r\nAspect ratio: 1.7822\r\nFormat: XVID\r\nBitrate: 2177 kbps\r\nFrames: 25.000\r\nSelected codec: ffdivx\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nFormat: 8192\r\nBitrate: 384 kbps\r\nRate: 48000 Hz\r\nChannels: 2\r\nSelected codec: ffac3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8640e8fb897fff8fe37ccecbe3d4c8f6f196daf4","amp;dn":"The+Queen+of+Ireland+2015+DVDRip.XviD.AC3-SPiNZES.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8640e8fb897fff8fe37ccecbe3d4c8f6f196daf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,64,232,251,137,127,255,143,227,124,206,203,227,212,200,246,241,150,218,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
