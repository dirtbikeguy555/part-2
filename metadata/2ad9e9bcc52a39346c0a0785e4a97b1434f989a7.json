The Baroque artist is superbly played by Nigel Terry and the story is brilliantly adapted to the screen by English director Derek Jarman. It is very sensually done, emphasizing the artist&amp;#039;s gargantuan appetites for bisexual and, especially, homosexual affairs with his models, the various scandals he was involved in---including murder and his tricky dealings with the church. It was filmed on a very restricted budget which only proves if you know how to shoot a film, you can do it on shoestring budget and still come up with an outstanding film.\n-Dennis Schwartz\n\n\n********************************* FREAKYFLICKS **********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
