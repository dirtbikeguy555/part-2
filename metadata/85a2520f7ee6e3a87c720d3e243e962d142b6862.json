Many examples and clear explanations. Covers every problem! Perfect for the foreign student, all ESL teachers and Home schoolers.\n\n\n--------------------\n\n\n*5 out of 5 stars at Amazon*\n\nUNCOVERING THE LOGIC OF ENGLISH: A Common-Sense Approach to Reading, Spelling, and Literacy by Denise Eide\n\n\n** Author of the hardcover book:\nDoodling Dragons: An ABC Book of Sounds (also 5 out of 5 stars at Amazon) **\n\nDescription:\n\nMultiple award-winning book on reading and spelling education that will transform how you think about English\n!\n    Do you know a student who is good at math or science but struggles with reading or spelling?\n    Has a student ever asked you a question about English spelling to which you replied, &quot;That's an exception&quot;?\n    Have you ever abandoned a word while writing because spell check didn't recognize it?\n\nDiscover this revolutionary method that Dr. Temple Grandin called &quot;really helpful for teaching reading to children who are mathematical pattern thinkers...&quot;\nPredominant reading methods require students to break the complex code of English without help. This has resulted in low literacy rates and explains why many highly educated professionals cannot spell. By revealing the logical patterns underlying 98% of English words, Uncovering the Logic of English eliminates the need to guess and provides a logical solution to English spelling.\n\nSimple answers are given for questions such as:\n\n    Why is there a silent final E in have?\n    Why don't we drop the E in noticeable?\n    Why is discussion spelled with -sion rather than -tion? \n\nAs the rules unfold it becomes apparent how this knowledge is vital to reversing the educational crisis that is plaguing America. This slim volume is easy to read and accessible to parents and classroom teachers. A thorough appendix summarizes the most important concepts for quick reference.\n\n\n--------------------\n\nNote: There is only the epub of DeniseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book as couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get the mobi file to display well enough. Epub displays tables and text better in landscape  mode. The flowchart displays better in portrait. I replaced the original flowchart as it was too small and parts not easy to read. Let me know if you have any problems.\n\nBoth files types of FulfordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s book works well, for the epub using Calibre for PC and Aldiko for Android, and Kindle for PC and Android for the mobi file.\n\nEnjoy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85a2520f7ee6e3a87c720d3e243e962d142b6862","amp;dn":"Complete+Guide+to+English+%26amp%3B+Uncovering+the+Logic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85a2520f7ee6e3a87c720d3e243e962d142b6862","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,162,82,15,126,230,227,168,124,114,13,62,36,62,150,45,20,43,104,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
