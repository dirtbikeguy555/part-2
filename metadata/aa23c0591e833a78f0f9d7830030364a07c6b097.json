Miller\r\nGenres: Action | Adventure | Comedy | Fantasy | Sci-Fi | Thriller\r\nCountry: USA | Canada\r\nLanguage: English\r\n\r\n\r\nDeadPool 2016 HD-TS x264-CPG\r\n\r\nVideo: AVC @ 1050kbps\r\nResolution: 720x304 @ 29fps\r\nAudio: mp3 2.0 128kbps\r\nLanguage: English\r\nSource: RussianCAM~ExclusiveFTP audio\r\nSamples: 2 included\r\nEncoder: CPG\r\n\r\nRead Note\r\n\r\nNow to the Encode, i suggest ya'll to read my notes for once so you will know what you are getting instead of relying on someone else judgement who probably don't even know how to shutdown computer properly anyways....\r\n\r\nUsed Russian source looks like those guys went twice to get this right, its good for CAM but had a little problem like few mins in between are missing not a big chunk imo, its the source issue no one can't do much about it unless with new source. \r\n\r\ncropped, resized then lower down the over bright parts, clean the source and put some smoothness back to video. occasionally  weird human head pop up bottom of the video its not worse but i did not crop it because it will chop out some video details that i want to keep.\r\nvideo has bit movements so i left some black bars though they are not weird movements that can spoil movie experience, you have to cut actual video to get rid of all black bars which i tend not to do i like to save more picture on cam encodes.\r\n\r\nUsed Exclusive Line audio and synced to my finish video lipoooosync all the way took my lot of time though.... nightmares\r\n\r\noh i almost forgot i have added After Credit Scene as well so do not close the player, Cuz Deadpool would like to talk to you after end credits \r\n\r\nLastly there may be new source or there may be not but whatever this would do just fine for Now and yes its more then watchable. 2 video samples are included in torrent.\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/fJt \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/fJx \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/fJ6 \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/fJV \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/fJu \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/fJv \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/fJA \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/fJW \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/fJf","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa23c0591e833a78f0f9d7830030364a07c6b097","amp;dn":"Deadpool+2016+HD-TS+x264-CPG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa23c0591e833a78f0f9d7830030364a07c6b097","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,35,192,89,30,131,58,120,240,249,215,131,0,48,54,74,7,198,176,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
