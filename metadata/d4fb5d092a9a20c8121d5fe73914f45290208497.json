And unlucky.\n\nHeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d picked the perfect spot to lose his virginity to his girlfriend, an abandoned farmyard in the middle of cornfields: nice, private, and quiet. The only problem was . . . something smelled badÃ¢â‚¬â€like, really bad. He mentioned it to a county deputy he knew, and when the cop took a look, he found a body stuffed down a cistern. And then another, and another.\n\nBy the time Lucas Davenport was called in, the police were up to fifteen bodies and counting. And as if that wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bad enough, when Lucas began to investigate, he made some disturbing discoveries of his own. The victims had been killed over a great many years, one every summer, regular as clockwork. How could this have happened without anybody noticing?\n\nBecause one thing was for sure: the killer had to live close by. He was probably even someone they saw every day. . . . \n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre reader ready. Metadata is complete and up to date.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4fb5d092a9a20c8121d5fe73914f45290208497","amp;dn":"Field+of+Prey+by+John+Sandford+%28ePub+Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4fb5d092a9a20c8121d5fe73914f45290208497","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,251,93,9,42,154,32,200,18,29,95,231,57,20,244,82,144,32,132,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
