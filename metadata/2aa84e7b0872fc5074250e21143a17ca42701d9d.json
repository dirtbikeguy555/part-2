It is a multidisciplinary subject encompassing many branches of science and engineering. Research areas such as computer vision, artificial intelligence, and speech recognition play key roles in the development and implementation of robotics.\n\nEngineering products designed and manufactured that integrate mechanical and electrical systems are known as mechatronic systems. Microcomputers, embedded computers, MEMS and associated software advances have led to much important advances in mechatronics in the recent years.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2aa84e7b0872fc5074250e21143a17ca42701d9d","amp;dn":"Robotics+and+Mechatronics+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2aa84e7b0872fc5074250e21143a17ca42701d9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,168,78,123,8,114,252,80,116,37,14,33,20,58,23,202,66,112,29,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
