The life in the village is calm and uneventful -- an allegory of Spanish life after General Franco's victory in the Spanish Civil War. While their father (Fernando FernÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³mez) studies bees in his beehive and their mother (Teresa Gimpera) writes letters to a non-existent correspondent, two young girls, Ana (Ana Torrent) and Isabel (Isabel Telleria), go to see James Whale's Frankenstein  at a local cinema. Though they can hardly understand the concept, both girls are deeply impressed with the moment when a little girl gives a flower to the monster. Isabel, the older sister, tells Ana that the monster actually exists as a spirit that you can't see unless you know how to approach him. Ana starts wandering around the countryside in search of the kind creature. The film received critical accolades for its subtle and masterful use of cinematic language and the expressive performance of the young Ana Torrent. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070040/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070040/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSubs\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-70040/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-70040/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:39:00\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 672x416  1,62:1\nCodec : XviD MPEG-4 codec\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 1786 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,27 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : ATSC/A-52 Dolby AC3\nNumber of channels : 1\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 192 Kbps\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n\nDon't hit and run.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ebab46bc8899f242ccefb3faf0f2537b9cba9a7","amp;dn":"The+Spirit+of+the+Beehive+%281973%29+Sp+Engsubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ebab46bc8899f242ccefb3faf0f2537b9cba9a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,186,180,107,200,137,159,36,44,206,251,63,175,15,37,55,185,203,169,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
