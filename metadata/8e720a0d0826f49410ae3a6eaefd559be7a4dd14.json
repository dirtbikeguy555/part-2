Knight), instructor solutions manual (ISM) by Larry Smith and Brett Kraabel.\n(ISM ISBN-13: 9780321769404; cannot be bought)\n\nTEXTBOOK INFO: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9687094/Physics_for_Scientists_and_Engineers_3rd_Knight_c2013_textbook&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9687094/Physics_for_Scientists_and_Engineers_3rd_Knight_c2013_textbook&lt;/a&gt;\n(There's another upload of the textbook available for those who believe bigger is better)\n\nFILE INFO: paginated, bookmarked, true PDF.\n\n2nd edition c2008: textbook and ISM also available here.\n\n[on soapbox]\nFull solutions manuals are like a poison: Too much of it, you die. In small dosages, you get stronger.\n \nAlways attempt the solution to a problem by yourself (after appropriate study of the topics) while following the procedure recommended by your teach or TA (problem comprehension, given data, requested parameter(s), type of problem, strategy of solution, execution, validation, blah, blah, blah). Only once you have solved it to the best of your ability should you resort to &quot;poison&quot;. Even when you get the correct answer to the problem you should take a look at the ISM... Sometimes you may get the correct answer, by chance, from a crooked application of a principle or from two self-cancelling algebra mistakes. Also you could learn another (often shorter) path of solution to the right answer, a sure way to enhance your performance in these beat the clock quiz/exams. Most of the time ISMs are \nwritten in a cryptic manner for instructors who (should) know their stuff, so if you don't know yours good enough at this point, ISM solutions will just look like a big load of gibberish. And reverse-engineering solutions isn't the proper way to learn as you won't have them in an exam setting. Nor casual reading of the ISM in the beer lounge at the frat house on the eve of an exam. Always write down your own solutions (study, practice problems, practice exams, assignments, etc). ISMs are a great learning tool but use them wisely. Or you will fail, big time. (I write from experience...)\n[off soapbox]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e720a0d0826f49410ae3a6eaefd559be7a4dd14","amp;dn":"Physics+for+Scientists+and+Engineers+3rd+Knight+solutions+ISM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e720a0d0826f49410ae3a6eaefd559be7a4dd14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,114,10,13,8,38,244,148,16,174,58,110,174,253,85,155,231,164,221,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
