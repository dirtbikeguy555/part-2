Entitled Revolutions - The Very Best Of\nSteve Winwood, it is a portrait of one of the most\ninfluential musicians in rock history, a singer-songwriter,\npeerless vocalist, guitarist and keyboard player.\n\nWith tracklistings personally selected by Steve Winwood from\nhis five decade career, Revolutions - The Very Best Of Steve\nWinwood also includes a re-recorded version of Spanish\nDancer.\n\nA child prodigy, Winwood first performed live on stage at the\ntender age of 8 in his fathers traditional jazz band, and\njoined the Spencer Davis Group at 14. His stunning vocal\nstyle was compared to Ray Charles. He left Spencer Davis to\nform Traffic then later teamed up with Eric Clapton in Blind\nFaith at the tail-end of the Sixties. Arguably his biggest\nsuccesses came with his solo work from the Seventies on.
