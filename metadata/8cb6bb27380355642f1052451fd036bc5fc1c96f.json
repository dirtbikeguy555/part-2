Founding bassist Andy Nicholson left in 2006.Each of the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first five singles I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor, When the Sun Goes Down, Leave Before the Lights Come On, Brianstorm and Fluorescent Adolescent hit the UK Top Five, but their sixth single, Teddy Picker, only went Top 20 and their seventh single, Crying Lightning peaked at #12.The bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rise to success started in late 2004/early 2005 when demo songs which had been handed out in CD form at gigs found their way onto the internet.These demos rapidly spread among message boards and friends leading to a growing fan base for the band, and were collected on the unofficial Beneath the Boardwalk, which the band recognizes on their website. The band owe much of their success to viral buzz via the Internet, and have eschewed typical Ã¢â‚¬ËœcommercialÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ channels, including refusing to appear on the UKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s (now discontinued) Top Of The Pops music program, which was often seen as a gateway to success.The bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s What IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Not, holds the record for the largest first week sales of a debut album in the UK (in its first week, it sold more than the rest of the Top 20 albums combined).The album sold over 360,000 copies in its first week, but lost the title in November 2007 to Leona LewisÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s album Spirit.\n\nArctic Monkeys - AM (2013)\n\nimage\nGenre: Pop/Rock\nStyles: Indie Rock, Alternative\nSource: Converted from CD FLAC\nCodec: MP3\nBit Rate: 320 CBR\nBit Depth: 16\nSampling Rate: 44,100 Hz\n\n\nTrack List:-\n01 Do I Wanna Know?

Instead, this is vibrant, moody music that showcases a band growing ever stronger with each risk and dare they take.\n\n\n\nArctic Monkeys @ MySpace\n\nEnjoy and support the artist !
