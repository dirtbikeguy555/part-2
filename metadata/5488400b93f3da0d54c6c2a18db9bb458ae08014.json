But the band did manage to obtain a large and devoted fan base, especially in their hometown of Los Angeles, CA. Oingo Boingo started not as a traditional group per se, as they were originally put together in the '70s by movie director Richard Elfman, who needed music for a whacked-out, John Waters-esque flick he was working on, called Forbidden Zone. Enlisting his younger brother Danny Elfman (vocals, guitar), Steve Bartek (guitar), and Johnny &quot;Vatos&quot; Hernandez (drums), the group originally went by the name Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo before shortening it to Oingo Boingo. Tired of sitting around and waiting for the movie's completion, the group began playing out in the L.A. area, where they built a substantial following with the punk/new wave set (as their lineup would often multiply for performances). But Oingo Boingo had a step or two ahead of the local bands, both musically and visually, as Danny Elfman had spent several years in France working with a theater group and studying orchestra, which reflected in Oingo Boingo's hodgepodge of styles.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\t\t\t\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\n\n01.Dead Man's Party\n02.When The Lights Go Out\n03.Gratitude\n04.Skin\n05.Flesh 'N Blood\n06.Not My Slave\n07.Stay\n08.Sweat\n09.No Spill Blood\n10.Out Of Control\n11.Weird Science\n12.No One Lives Forever\n13.Wild Sex (In The Working Class)\n14.Just Another Day\n15.Who Do You Want To Be\n16.Only A Lad\n17.Goodbye-Goodbye\n\n\n\nCheers!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5488400b93f3da0d54c6c2a18db9bb458ae08014","amp;dn":"Oingo+Boingo+-+Best+O%5C%27+Boingo+%281991%29+%5B320+Rip%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5488400b93f3da0d54c6c2a18db9bb458ae08014","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,136,64,11,147,243,218,13,84,198,194,161,141,185,187,69,138,224,128,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
