Waiting to be installed and closes the program.\n\n3.- Enables again the security systems and antivirus!\n\n4.- Restart the PC.\n\nThis will activate you Windows or Office but a few months later you can get out a notice that is pirated, then follow the same steps, so I recommend that you keep this tool!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nPermanent Activation by &quot;AutoKMS Tool&quot;:\n\nIf you want to avoid from time to time be activating your Microsoft products, then I recommend you use the &quot;AutoKMS Tool&quot;, this tool is installed on your pc and every time you need an activation your Office or your Windows will do this automatically.\n\nInstructions:\n\n1.- Read the note at the beginning of the previous instruction, and follow it.\n\n2.- Run as Administrator, then open a window and at the bottom right there will be two buttons with one image every one, one is the symbol of office and the other is the symbol of Windows, choose which you want to activate.\n\n3.- Once inside go to the tab &quot;Activation&quot; and in the &quot;Activator / Tool Selection&quot; make this choice the &quot;AutoKMS&quot; and then you click on the button &quot;Install&quot;.\n\n4.- When the installation is finished close the program.\n\n5.- Go to your settings on your antivirus and put the &quot;AutoKMS Tool&quot; (C:  Windows  AutoKMS  AutoKMS.exe) in the list of excluded.
