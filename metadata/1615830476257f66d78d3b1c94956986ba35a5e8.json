Funny things happen to Robin, Starfire, Raven, Beast Boy and Cyborg between saving the world and being regular teens, living together without adult supervision. The teens, in their ordinary lives, deal with the everyday issues of adolescence that include such important things as having staring contests to determine who does the laundry and going on a series of quests to construct the perfect sandwich. But, of course, the heroes still fight crime in Jump City when the need arises. Whatever the situation, they're always ready for an adventure -- inside the house or out of it.\nFirst episode date: April 23, 2013\nNetwork: Cartoon Network\nNumber of seasons: 2 &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://kat.cr/user/midoucaca/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://kat.cr/user/midoucaca/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1615830476257f66d78d3b1c94956986ba35a5e8","amp;dn":"Teen+Titans+Go+S02+720p+WEB-DL+by+midoucaca","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1615830476257f66d78d3b1c94956986ba35a5e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,21,131,4,118,37,127,102,215,141,59,28,148,149,105,134,186,53,165,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
