Simple enough, sez I, surely the good old world of torrents can supply them quickly enough. El Wrongo. Not only has nobody bothered to gather them together, but simply getting decent Simpsons episodes proved difficult. One guy has the entire series as AVIs with the commentary forced over the soundtrack. Another moron uploaded them in some obnoxious codec that wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t play anywhere. Yet another had them all in full DVD format, but only in PAL. I finally found most of what I needed on Demonoid.\n\nWhy bother you with all this? A couple of reasons. First, I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want to hear a thing about quality, .srt files, or format. This is the best I could find that someone was actually bothering to seed. If you want a better collection of quality, then break out the commercial DVDs and burn them up. I am sure the resulting torrent will be happily received. This is literally the best I could get. Secondly, why is it that people insist on uploading things in the most inconvenient and stupid fashion possible? We donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t need OR want your stupid-ass codecs, formats, or anything else you can think of that complicates things. If it wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t play in a standard player, or it takes up 10 times the space it should (you FLAC-fools!), then go to hell, go directly to hell, etc.\n\nSeriously, though ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ if someone out there has the commercial DVDs and is willing to up them in either .avi for NTSC DVD format, you are going to get a lot of leechers. Great thanks to cyberegg on Demonoid who was the only uploader with a modicum of any sense.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096697/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096697/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19afe8287df19793ee27c512f06326e525e26e71","amp;dn":"Simpsons+-+All+Halloween+Treehouse+Of+Horror+Episodes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19afe8287df19793ee27c512f06326e525e26e71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,175,232,40,125,241,151,147,238,39,197,18,240,99,38,229,37,226,110,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
