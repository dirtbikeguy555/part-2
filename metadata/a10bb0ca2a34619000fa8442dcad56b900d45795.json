While the dialogue between the gut and the brain has been recognized by ancient healing traditions, including Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine, Western medicine has by and large failed to appreciate the complexity of how the brain, gut, and more recently, the gut microbiotaâ€”the microorganisms that live inside our digestive tractâ€”communicate with one another. In The Mind-Gut Connection, Dr. Emeran Mayer, professor of medicine and executive director of the UCLA Center for Neurobiology of Stress, offers a revolutionary and provocative look at this developing science, teaching us how to harness the power of the mind-gut connection to take charge of our health and listen to the innate wisdom of our bodies.\r\n\r\nThe Mind-Gut Connection describes:\r\n\r\n[color=#ed865b]âˆ™ Why consuming a predominantly plant-based diet is key for gut and brain health\r\n\r\nâˆ™ The importance of early childhood in gut-brain development, and what parents can do to help their children thrive\r\n\r\nThe role of excessive stress and anxiety in GI ailments and cognitive disorders\r\n\r\nHow to â€œlisten to your gutâ€ and pay attention to the signals your body is sending you\r\n\r\nâˆ™ and much more.[/color][/b][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][b]---&gt; To convert to any other or to read format use this software:[/b][/center]\r\n[center][b]Calibre[/b][/center]\r\n[center][b]---&gt; To read on mobile devices use this software:[/b][/center]\r\n[center][b]Aldiko[/b][/center]\r\n\r\n[center][color=#2a2829][b]Seed as soon as you can[/b][/color][/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a10bb0ca2a34619000fa8442dcad56b900d45795","amp;dn":"The+Mind-Gut+Connection%3A+How+the+Hidden+Conversation+Within+Our+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a10bb0ca2a34619000fa8442dcad56b900d45795","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,11,176,202,42,52,97,144,0,250,132,66,220,173,86,185,0,212,87,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
