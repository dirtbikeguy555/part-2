By the end, no one in the Berlin bunker was closer to the FÃ¼hrer than his devoted Reich minister for public enlightenment and propaganda. But how did this clubfooted son of a factory worker rise from obscurity to become Hitlerâ€™s most trusted lieutenant and personally anointed successor?\r\n\r\nIn this ground-breaking biography, Peter Longerich sifts through the historical recordâ€”and thirty thousand pages of Goebbelsâ€™s own diary entriesâ€”to provide the answer to that question. Longerich, the first historian to make use of the Goebbels diaries in a biographical work, engages and challenges the self-serving portrait the propaganda chief left behind. Spanning thirty years, the diaries paint a chilling picture of a man driven by a narcissistic desire for recognition who found the personal affirmation he craved within the virulently racist National Socialist movement. Delving into the mind of his subject, Longerich reveals how Goebbelsâ€™s lifelong search for a charismatic father figure inexorably led him to Hitler, to whom he ascribed almost godlike powers.\r\n\r\nThis comprehensive biography documents Goebbelsâ€™s ascent through the ranks of the Nazi Party, where he became a member of the FÃ¼hrerâ€™s inner circle and launched a brutal campaign of anti-Semitic propaganda. Though endowed with near-dictatorial control of the mediaâ€”film, radio, press, and the fine artsâ€”Longerichâ€™s Goebbels is a man dogged by insecurities and beset by bureaucratic infighting. He feuds with his bitter rivals Hermann GÃ¶ring and Alfred Rosenberg, unsuccessfully advocates for a more radical line of â€œtotal war,â€ and is thwarted in his attempt to pursue a separate peace with the Allies during the waning days of World War II. This book also reveals, as never before, Goebbelsâ€™s twisted personal lifeâ€”his mawkish sentimentality, manipulative nature, and voracious sexual appetite","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c235b005e0c20667be4860bc31a133c2fc68473","amp;dn":"Goebbels%3A+A+Biography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c235b005e0c20667be4860bc31a133c2fc68473","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,35,91,0,94,12,32,102,123,228,134,11,195,26,19,60,47,198,132,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
