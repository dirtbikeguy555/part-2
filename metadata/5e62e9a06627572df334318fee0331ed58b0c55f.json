Directed by Wolfgang Petersen (`Troy&amp;#039; , `The Perfect Storm&amp;#039;) this is the adventure of Bastian (Barrett Oliver), a lonely young boy who escapes the ugliness of his everyday life by retreating into a mysterious book that carries him into a shimmering world of creatures, giant forests and massive oceans.  An awesome world, but a world in decay and whose existence is threatened by...The Nothing!  Climb aboard the Luck Dragon with Bastian and become a part of The Never Ending Story.\n\n\nC O M M E N T S\n\nI forgot how much I loved this film!, 5 July 2004\nAuthor: sl_1999 from Limerick, Ireland \n\nI saw this film on Channel 4 recently (for those of you who don&amp;#039;t know, Channel 4 is a British T.V station). It brought back a load of memories for me as I loved this film when I was younger. I could recall all the things I loved about this film: the talking dog (I think it was a dog anyway), a giant snail and the big bad wolf. I didn&amp;#039;t understand what the film was about back then and after seeing it recently, I still am confused!\nThe visual effects are quite impressive for the films&amp;#039; time (who would have thought they had such marvelous effects 20 years ago)! I haven&amp;#039;t seen Neverending Story 2 &amp; 3 yet because I&amp;#039;ve heard they&amp;#039;re kinda rubbish but I am considering giving them a bit of a peak. One last thing...why is the title in German? \n\n\nBE AWARE OF BOGUS SITES AND LAMERS\n\nENJOY!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e62e9a06627572df334318fee0331ed58b0c55f","amp;dn":"The+NeverEnding+Story%5B1984%5DDvDrip%5B720x436%5DAC3%5B6ch%5D%5BEng%5D-RHooD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e62e9a06627572df334318fee0331ed58b0c55f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,98,233,160,102,39,87,45,243,52,49,143,238,3,49,237,88,176,197,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
