Finally a free man at 61, he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wait to get home. But despite his grandson ElliotÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s excitement and his JulieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s joy at having her father home after suffering a painful divorce, his homecoming is marred by his wife JackieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s distance.  His granddaughter Ellie and estranged son Joe are notably absent.  And sister in law Sue canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wait to get her husband Roy away from Jimmy.  Finally alone, Jackie admits to Jimmy that she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know if she loves him anymore.  Jackie is the love of his life and he is devastated.\n \nJimmy is on license and is reminded by his probation officer that he needs to stick to his terms and tie down a job, so Jimmy reluctantly accepts a zero hour contract at a DIY store - a mundane world away from anything heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever known. \n \nJimmy shows up uninvited to his granddaughterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fifth birthday party but his successful son Joe boots him out, bitterly telling him that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no surprise that Ellie has wound up like him. Stunned, Jimmy learns from Roy that Ellie ran away to live with her boyfriend six months ago and is now a drug addict. But they only have the name of an estate in Lewisham. Ellie was the apple of his eye, Jimmy tracks her down on the estate and whilst sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s happy to see her granddad again, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s showing signs of addiction.  Her boyfriend, Aaron, slams the door in JimmyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s face. Big mistake.\n \nJimmy refuses to give up on Ellie, but the local GP proves ineffectual. With Jackie refusing to talk to him, Jimmy conscripts Roy to help drag Ellie home to get clean. Jimmy chases Aaron down and destroys his heroin stash, but both Aaron and Ellie escape leaving Jimmy with an empty Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pizza ThisÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ pizza box, a clue to their drug supply.\n \nJimmy tells Jackie that heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s found Ellie but has to break the news that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s become a heroin addict. Bonded by grief, they spend the night together, giving Jimmy hope in their marriage. Jimmy slips out to Pizza This to confront his granddaughterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s suppliers but he asks too many questions and is beaten unconscious. Being 61 and alive in this brave new world is proving not so easy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:352b1da5cc2b131d41255d1c9df558bf4b668620","amp;dn":"The.Trials.of.Jimmy.Rose.s01e01.EN.SUB.WEBRIP.%5BMPup%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"352b1da5cc2b131d41255d1c9df558bf4b668620","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,43,29,165,204,43,19,29,65,37,93,28,157,245,88,191,75,102,134,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
