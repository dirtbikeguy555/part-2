These files may be a little large for some.  But if you aren't worried about space, and want a higher quality, to output to a t.v. or such, then this may be for you.\n\nNOTE: Since the only source I could get my hands on were DVD-5's, the quality is not quite on par with the rest of the series.  I did the best I could with them and they look pretty decent, however they were already compressed from the original DVD-9's from the start.\n\n------------------------\nSLIDERS - SEASON 5\n------------------------\nEpisodes 1-18\n\nSOURCE: PAL DVD-5's found online (thanks to ili2882)\nConstant Quality Rate Factor(CRF) of 18.5\n\nVIDEO:\nContainer: MKV\nCodec: x264\nDisplay Resolution: 720 x 576 (4:3)\nfps: 25\n\n\nAUDIO:\nEnglish, AC3 (2-channel) (Note: DVD does not have 5.1)\n\nHope you enjoy!!\n\nPlease seed when you are done...a good rule of thumb is to upload at least as much as you've downloaded (1 to 1 ratio)...thanks!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed14c05c26d729593d0078d61e03879768200088","amp;dn":"Sliders.Season.5.DvdRip.x264.AC3-MCH+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed14c05c26d729593d0078d61e03879768200088","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,20,192,92,38,215,41,89,61,0,120,214,30,3,135,151,104,32,0,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
