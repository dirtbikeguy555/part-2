He and a group of radical animal-rights activists hit a Singular Corp. research lab in Eugene, Oregon. The raid was a disaster, but Odin escaped with a set of highly encrypted flash drives and a post-surgical dog. \n\nWhen Shay gets a frantic 3 a.m. phone call from OdinÃ¢â‚¬â€talking about evidence of unspeakable experiments, and a ruthless corporation, and how he must hideÃ¢â‚¬â€sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s concerned. When she gets a menacing visit from SingularÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s security team, she knows: her brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a dead man walking. \n\nWhat Singular doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t knowÃ¢â‚¬â€yetÃ¢â‚¬â€is that 16-year-old Shay is every bit as ruthless as their security force, and she will burn Singular to the ground, if thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what it takes to save her brother. \n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre reader ready. Metadata is complete and up to date.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:243cac40a5f2c5fa644a58b2bd3841bd3182fae6","amp;dn":"Uncaged+by+John+Sandford%2C+et+al.+%28ePub+Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"243cac40a5f2c5fa644a58b2bd3841bd3182fae6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,60,172,64,165,242,197,250,100,74,88,178,189,56,65,189,49,130,250,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
