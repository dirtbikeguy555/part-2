After RCA Records executive vice president of promotions announced that Spears was going to take a break in 2012, the singer signed a contract to be a judge on the second season of American music competition show The X Factor. A few months later, she announced that she had collaborated with will.i.am on a new track; they worked together the previous year on two tracks for Femme Fatale , with one called &quot;Big Fat Bass&quot; making the final cut. Initially rumored to be called &quot;Sexy Sexy&quot; and set to be released on October 15, 2012, will.i.am pushed back the release date following unauthorized leaks of the album. &quot;Scream and Shout&quot; was then confirmed as a single, premiering on US and UK radio on November 19, 2012 and will officially be sent to mainstream radio through Interscope Records on November 27, 2012.\n\nIn the format: MP3 (320kps)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52b0009d1b57c49ebbe83634dc74bd011d77fb81","amp;dn":"Will.i.am+Feat.+Britney+Spears+-+Scream+and+Shout","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52b0009d1b57c49ebbe83634dc74bd011d77fb81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,176,0,157,27,87,196,158,187,232,54,52,220,116,189,1,29,119,251,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
