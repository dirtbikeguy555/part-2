Unlike the Beastie Boys, he didn't have any street credibility, so the Miami-born rapper decided to invent some of his own, claiming he had a seriously violent gangster past. Nevertheless, &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot; became a number one hit late in 1990, thanks to the pulsating bass riff from David Bowie and Queen's &quot;Under Pressure.&quot; To the Extreme also went to the top of the charts, spending 16 weeks at number one and selling over seven million copies. Ice began filming a feature film, Cool as Ice, in the spring of 1990, but by the time the film came out in the fall, his star had fallen dramatically; To the Extreme was at number one longer than the soundtrack to Cool as Ice was even on the charts.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRap &amp; Hip Hop\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n\n01.Ice Ice Baby\n02.Get Wit' It\n03.Play That Funky Music (Live)\n04.Roll 'Em Up\n05.Rollin' In My 5.0 (Live)\n06.Cool As Ice (Everybody Get Loose)\n07.Hooked\n08.I Love You\n09.Ninja Rap\n10.Satisfaction (Live)\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c166f713c82240fbb0e43b16ea5e9a5778e1e26","amp;dn":"Vanilla+Ice+-+The+Best+Of+Vanilla+Ice+%281999%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c166f713c82240fbb0e43b16ea5e9a5778e1e26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,22,111,113,60,130,36,15,187,14,67,177,110,165,233,165,119,142,30,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
