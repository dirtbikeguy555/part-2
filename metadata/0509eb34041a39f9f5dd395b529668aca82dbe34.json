It is Staind's most successful album to date, and was the album that broke them into the mainstream. It was a huge international success for the band, as it spent 3 weeks at number 1 position in the U.S. album charts and many weeks in the top 10 album charts of The Billboard 200, the UK and New Zealand. It sold 4 million copies in 2001. The album was certified 5x platinum by the RIAA. Out of all mainstream bands in 2001, it also became the #1 best-selling U.S. rock album to be released in that year.\n\nA total of 5 singles were released from this album, &quot;It's Been Awhile&quot;, &quot;Fade&quot;, &quot;Outside&quot;, &quot;For You&quot; and &quot;Epiphany&quot;, all of which did reasonably well. There were videos made for each of these songs (some of which can be found on Staind's MTV Unplugged DVD). The first four singles had varying degrees of success in the UK, &quot;It's Been Awhile&quot; charting the highest of the four released in both countries. The album also includes a track called &quot;Waste&quot; dedicated to two teenage fans who committed suicide. While Break The Cycle is a heavy and aggressive alternative metal/nu metal album, it starts to show the band focusing more on its post-grunge sound, which would play a bigger part on the band's future albums. This is evident in the album's hit &quot;It's Been Awhile&quot; and other songs on the album.\n\nThere is also a bonus track on the album. In the U.S., the bonus track is an acoustic version of &quot;It's Been Awhile&quot;. However on the Australian and European editions, the bonus track is a live acoustic version of &quot;Outside&quot;, performed with Fred Durst in Biloxi, Mississippi on the Family Values Tour 1999.Track listing\n\nAll lyrics written by Aaron Lewis, all music by Staind, except where noted.\nNo. \tTitle \tMusic \tLength \t\n1. \t&quot;Open Your Eyes&quot;   \t  \t3:52\n2. \t&quot;Pressure&quot;   \tStaind, Josh Abraham \t3:22\n3. \t&quot;Fade&quot;   \t  \t4:03\n4. \t&quot;It's Been Awhile&quot;   \t  \t4:25\n5. \t&quot;Change&quot;   \t  \t3:35\n6. \t&quot;Can't Believe&quot;   \t  \t2:48\n7. \t&quot;Epiphany&quot;   \tLewis \t4:19\n8. \t&quot;Suffer&quot;   \t  \t3:59\n9. \t&quot;Safe Place&quot;   \t  \t4:35\n10. \t&quot;For You&quot;   \t  \t3:26\n11. \t&quot;Outside&quot;   \tLewis \t4:52\n12. \t&quot;Waste&quot;   \t  \t3:56\n13. \t&quot;Take It&quot;   \t  \t3:37\nTotal length:\n\t50:49 \t\n \t\nPersonnel\n\nStaind\n\n    Aaron Lewis Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Lead vocals, rhythm guitar, acoustic guitar\n    Mike Mushok Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Lead guitar\n    Johnny April Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bass, backup vocals\n    Jon Wysocki Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Drums\n\nAdditional musicians\n\n    Fred Durst Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Additional backing vocals on &quot;It's Been Awhile&quot; and &quot;Outside&quot;\n    Mike Kezner Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sitar, backup vocals\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0509eb34041a39f9f5dd395b529668aca82dbe34","amp;dn":"Stained+-+Break+The+Cycle+mp3++320k+CDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0509eb34041a39f9f5dd395b529668aca82dbe34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,9,235,52,4,26,57,249,245,221,57,91,82,150,104,172,168,45,190,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
