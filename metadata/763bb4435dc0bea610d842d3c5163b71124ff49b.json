But the terror is not over. Now a U.S. Agent, former Raccoon Police Officer Leon Kennedy has been dispatched on a mission to Europe to save the President's daughter from a &quot;crazed organization&quot; that bares a striking behavioral resemblance to creatures found in the Arklay Mountains. Is there a connection between these foes and the horrible nightmares from the past? Discover the answer for yourself in Resident Evil 4, the first truly three-dimensional installment of the series.\n\nRE4 was originally developed for the PS2, then cancelled and moved to GameCube (and significantly reinvisioned again while in development), only to reappear on PlayStation 2 once again in 2005.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:763bb4435dc0bea610d842d3c5163b71124ff49b","amp;dn":"Resident+Evil+4+%28PS2%29+%28NTSC%29+%28Fabio5ilva%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"763bb4435dc0bea610d842d3c5163b71124ff49b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,59,180,67,93,192,190,166,16,216,66,211,197,22,59,113,18,79,244,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
