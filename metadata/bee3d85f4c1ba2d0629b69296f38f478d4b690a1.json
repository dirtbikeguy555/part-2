If they agree to help, their sentences will be reduced by one month for each fugitive they bring in, and they will be transferred to a minimum-security facility. However, if any of them should try to escape, they will all be returned to their original prisons, and their sentences will be doubled.\n\n\nList of Episodes:\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=631054#pid631054&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=631054#pid631054&lt;/a&gt;  \n\n\nFormat :\t\tXviD+264\nFile size:  \t\t350 MiB avg. per episode \nDuration : \t\t43 min avg. per episode\nWidth : \t\t624 pixels\nHeight : \t\t352 pixels\nAspect ratio :  \t16:9\nFrame rate :    \t23.976 fps\nAudio:  \t\tMP3+AAC\nNr. of Files:\t\t9 + 1 Trailer + 1 Teaser + 1 txt = 12\n                        (Eps 9+10 are one file)\n\n\nAll files properly named, keeping the original file names intact.\nThis pack wouldn't have been possible without you, we worship you,\n\n+++eztv+++TvTeam+++VTV+++scenebalance+++TorrentDay+++eztv+++\n                                      and the release groups\n2HD,ASAP,FQM,LOL,IMMERSE,FEVER,SYS,ORENJI,REWARD,SPASTiKUS,MiXED,MOMENTUM, and all the others (too many to mention them all)\n\nAfter 24 hours initial seeding there should be enough seeders to get the whole thing with decent speed in a decent time.\n\n###################  You like your show in one pack?  ###################\n#########################  Here you go!  #########################\nVisit the KABLAM!!! @ forum.suprbay.org\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor questions,requests,comments feel free to PM me on SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWant to be kept in the loop?
