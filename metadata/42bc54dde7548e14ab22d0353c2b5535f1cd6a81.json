In speaking of the purely aesthetic qualities of theorems and proofs, G. H. Hardy wrote that in beautiful proofs 'there is a very high degree of unexpectedness, combined with inevitability and economy'. Charming Proofs presents a collection of remarkable proofs in elementary mathematics that are exceptionally elegant, full of ingenuity, and succinct. By means of a surprising argument or a powerful visual representation, the proofs in this collection will invite readers to enjoy the beauty of mathematics, and to develop the ability to create proofs themselves. The authors consider proofs from topics such as geometry, number theory, inequalities, plane tilings, origami and polyhedra. Secondary school and university teachers can use this book to introduce their students to mathematical elegance. More than 130 exercises for the reader (with solutions) are also included.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42bc54dde7548e14ab22d0353c2b5535f1cd6a81","amp;dn":"Charming+Proofs%2C+A+Journey+into+Elegant+Mathematics+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStorm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42bc54dde7548e14ab22d0353c2b5535f1cd6a81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,188,84,221,231,84,142,20,171,34,208,53,60,43,85,53,241,205,106,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
