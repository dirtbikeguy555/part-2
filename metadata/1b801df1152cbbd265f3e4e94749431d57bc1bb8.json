The 1981 film version of this tome was evidently meant to be taken seriously, but the operatic direction by Frank Perry and the over-the-top portrayal of Joan Crawford by Faye Dunaway (whose makeup is remarkable) has always seemed to inspire loud laughter whenever and where-ever the film is shown. According to the film (and the book that preceded it), Joan Crawford was a licentious, child-beating behemoth, who stalked and postured through life as though it was one of her own pictures-more Strait-jacket than Mildred Pierce. This is the film with the notorious &quot;wire coat hanger&quot; scene, just in case you need a reminder. Surprisingly, one emerges from Mommie Dearest with more sympathy for the monstrous but intensely vulnerable Crawford than for her whining daughter (played as an adult by Diana Scarwid, and as a child by Mara Hobel). Our favorite scene: Joan Crawford dazedly replacing her ailing daughter in the cast of a daytime TV soap opera.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082766/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082766/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-82766/sublanguageid-all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/imdbid-82766/sublanguageid-all&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 592x336\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 25,00\nBitRate : 1458 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,30 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b801df1152cbbd265f3e4e94749431d57bc1bb8","amp;dn":"Mommie+Dearest+%281981%29+Faye+Dunaway%2Cmultisubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b801df1152cbbd265f3e4e94749431d57bc1bb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,128,29,241,21,44,187,210,101,243,228,233,71,73,67,29,87,188,27,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
