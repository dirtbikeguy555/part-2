It was clear that Weller weclomed a break from the punk stylings of The Jam. The Style Council effectively broke that mold.\r\nBut, after some initial singles, such as 1983's scathing &quot;Money Go Round,&quot; the Style Council launched &quot;My Ever Changing Moods,&quot; an album of daring uniqueness. \r\nYou just cannot classify the album at all -- it contains the soul of &quot;You're the Best Thing,&quot; the ragtime piano riffs of &quot;Mick's Blessings,&quot; the calypso beat of &quot;Me Ship Came In!&quot; in which Weller lets loose on the fretboard of his guitar, the introspective guitar and vocals only &quot;The Whole Point of No Return,&quot; the elevator muzak of &quot;Blue Cafe,&quot; the silly rap of &quot;A Gospel,&quot; the barnhouse stomping folk of &quot;Here's One that Got Away,&quot; the new wave pop of &quot;Strength of your Nature,&quot; and the freestyle brass jazz of &quot;Dropping Bombs on the White House.&quot;\r\nThe high point of the album is no doubt Everything But the Girl's guest appearance on the song &quot;The Paris Match,&quot; with Tracey Thorn's vocals ruefully remembering a lost love in perfect timing with Ben Watt's guitar. It is a jazz ballad that ends on an eerie note (literally), much like the end chord of the Beatle's &quot;A Day in the Life.&quot; (Customer from Amazon)\r\n\r\n \nhttp://i.imgur.com/0R7SiU7.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n01.
