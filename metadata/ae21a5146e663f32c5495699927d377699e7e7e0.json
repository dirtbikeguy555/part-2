Nine countries in the world (probably) have nuclear weapons and a dozen more have access to the resources and technology needed to produce such a weapon. \r\nNuclear Secrets is a series of spy thrillers exploring the key turning-points in the race for nuclear supremacy. From the development of the A-bomb, via the Cuban missile crisis, to the spread of nuclear weapons to the Middle East and beyond, each story is told through the eyes of the men who risked everything to proliferate their nuclear secrets and those who tried to stop them. Nuclear weapons and the actions of these men have transformed the face of war - and now the world could pay the price. \r\n\r\nA Dune Films, BBC/National Geographic Channel and NDR Norddeutscher Rundfunk Co-production\r\n\r\n2)  The Terror Trader \r\nCould the father of the Pakistani bomb be the creator of the largest nuclear-smuggling ring ever known? This story reveals a cat-and-mouse tale of an out-of-control nuclear scientist and Western intelligence. In 1975, a young scientist copied top-secret blueprints from his Dutch Nuclear company. The thief in question was Dr AQ Khan, a Pakistani nuclear scientist who was working in the Netherlands. With fame came wealth and the CIA discovered that Khan had acquired a large property empire. The CIA and MI6 were unclear what Khan was up to but, as time went on, the clues grew more alarming. They set up a joint task force which eventually led to Dr Khan's &quot;nuclear bazaar&quot;. The world saw for the first time the terrifying scale of Khan's activities. The president of Pakistan placed him under house arrest, where he remains today.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7f/Nuclear-Secrets-Set-Two-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/54/Nuclear-Secrets-Set-Two-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/59/Nuclear-Secrets-Set-Two-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3d/Nuclear-Secrets-Set-Two-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d4/Nuclear-Secrets-Set-Two-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a9/Nuclear-Secrets-Set-Two-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/65/Nuclear-Secrets-Set-Two-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9f/Nuclear-Secrets-Set-Two-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/86/Nuclear-Secrets-Set-Two-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/14/Nuclear-Secrets-Set-Two-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/62/Nuclear-Secrets-Set-Two-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/06/Nuclear-Secrets-Set-Two-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e8/Nuclear-Secrets-Set-Two-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/44/Nuclear-Secrets-Set-Two-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c3/Nuclear-Secrets-Set-Two-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/43/Nuclear-Secrets-Set-Two-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: 1 739 Kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 720x400\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Per Second: 25.000 fps\r\nAudio Codec: AC3\r\nAudio Bitrate: 224 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\r\nAudio Streams: 2\r\nAudio Languages: english\r\nRunTime Per Part: 50 min\r\nNumber Of Parts: 2\r\nPart Size: 670 MB - 704 MB\r\nEncoded by: DocFreak08\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nSource: \nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Nuclear_Secrets:_Set_Two","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae21a5146e663f32c5495699927d377699e7e7e0","amp;dn":"BBC+Nuclear+Secrets+Set+Two+2of2+The+Terror+Trader+x264+AC3+MVGr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae21a5146e663f32c5495699927d377699e7e7e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,33,165,20,110,102,63,50,197,73,86,153,146,125,55,118,153,231,231,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
