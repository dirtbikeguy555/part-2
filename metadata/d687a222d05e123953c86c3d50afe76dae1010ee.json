They were only a Birmingham local band but managed to gain a solid following.\n\nIn the wake of Ã¢â‚¬Å“By Blood and IronÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, Erra formed in 2009 following a line-up change grabbing ex guitarist of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Broadcast the NightmareÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The band became a solid unit shortly after with countless practices and completely honing their sound. It wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hard for the band to find their sound with everyone having the same influences and style of writing tech-rhythm time signatures and melodies. The main focus of the band was writing music people would hear and not automatically fit them into genres and sub-genres shoving them to the side into the over saturated Ã¢â‚¬Å“cliche metalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ market we have now days. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not about fashion or status with these guys. They genuinely want to make music that will give hope to innovative music and hard to please listeners. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not easy to please every listener but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy to gain the respect of fellow musicians and listeners with their raw talent and energy.\n\nThey entered the Studio in late 2009 for their self titled ep. With Guitarists Jesse Cash and Alan Rigdon constantly writing material, they entered the studio again in July of 2010 for their second release, Ã¢â‚¬Å“AndromedaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Andromeda is set to release in December 2010.\n\nLine-up:\n\nGarrison Lee- Vocals\nJesse Cash- Guitar/Vocals\nAdam Hicks- Bass\nAlan Rigdon- Guitar\nAlex Ballew- Drums\n\n\n\nImpulse\n\nLatest full-lenght released in 2011.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
