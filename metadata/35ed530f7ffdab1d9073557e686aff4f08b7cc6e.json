John Lennon rose to worldwide fame as a founder member of the rock band the Beatles, the most commercially successful band in the history of popular music. However, Lennon also had an extremely successful solo career with album sales exceeding 15 million. His biggest solo hits are all featured here including &quot;Imagine&quot;, &quot;Instant Karma&quot;, and &quot;Jealous Guy&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35ed530f7ffdab1d9073557e686aff4f08b7cc6e","amp;dn":"John+Lennon+-+Icon+%282015%29+Collection+%40+MP3+%2F+320+Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35ed530f7ffdab1d9073557e686aff4f08b7cc6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,237,83,15,127,253,171,29,144,115,85,126,104,106,255,79,8,183,204,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
