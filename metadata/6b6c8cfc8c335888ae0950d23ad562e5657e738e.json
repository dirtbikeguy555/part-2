Experimentation in the music is a major criteria to define the genre where artists often add unique elements to the overall sound, while progressive metal usually has more focus on traditional metal instrumentation and higher levels of technical complexity.\n\nIt's nearly impossible to pinpoint the exact origin of Experimental Progressive Metal since experimentation is common in all music genres. Still it is clear that experimentation in the progressive metal sub-genre has slowly but steadily grown in popularity ever since its humble beginnings in the early 1980s.\n\n\nIsis (stylized as ISIS) was a Los Angeles, California-based post-metal band, founded in Boston, Massachusetts, with a career spanning from 1997 to 2010. They borrowed from, and helped to evolve, a sound pioneered by the likes of Neurosis and Godflesh, creating heavy music consisting of lengthy songs that focus on repetition and evolution of structure.\nThe band's last album, Wavering Radiant, was released on 5 May 2009. They disbanded (what a shame, they were such a excellent band) in June 2010, just before the release of a split EP with the Melvins.\n\n\n\nAlbums\n\n2000 - Celestial\n2002 - Oceanic\n2004 - Panopticon\n2006 - In The Absence Of Truth\n2009 - Wavering Radiant\n\nCollaborations and other releases\n\n2000 - Pig Destroyer &amp; Isis Split 7\n2005 - Oceanic Remixes and Reinterpretations\n\nExtended plays\n1998 - The Mosquito Control [EP]\n1999 - Sawblade [EP]\n1999 - The Red Sea [EP]\n2001 - Sgnl05 [EP]\n2006 - In The Fishtank [EP]\n\nLive\n\n2004 - Live.01\n2005 - Live.02\n2005 - Live.03\n2006 - Live.04\n2009 - Live.05\n\nSingles\n\n2008 - Holy Tears [Single]\n2008 - Not In Rivers, But In Drops [Single]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b6c8cfc8c335888ae0950d23ad562e5657e738e","amp;dn":"Isis+Discography+%40+320+kbps+%5B5+studio+albums%2C+2+Collaborations+a","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b6c8cfc8c335888ae0950d23ad562e5657e738e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,108,140,252,140,51,88,136,174,9,80,210,58,213,98,229,101,126,115,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
