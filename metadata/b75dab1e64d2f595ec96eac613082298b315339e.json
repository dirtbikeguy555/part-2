The RAM disk appears like a physical hard disk to the operating system and programs. You choose its size (depending on the amount of RAM in your system), drive letter, and file system. You can copy, move and delete files on it. Like a physical disk, a RAM disk can also be shared so as to be accessed by other computers on a network.\n\nThe most important difference between a RAM disk and a hard disk is access speed. The time taken for a hard disk to move its magnetic heads over the spinning disks (much like the arm moving over old vinyl record player) is typically measured in milliseconds (thousandths of a second). Whereas a RAM disk does not have mechanical parts and its access speed is typically measured in nanoseconds (billionths of a second). Access to a RAM disk may be 50 times faster or more than to a hard drive.\n\n\nInstall Notes\n1. Install the program and do not run.\n2. Copy the keygen to prog dir, i.e. &quot;C:Program FilesSuperSpeedRamDisk&quot;.\n3. Run the keygen and insert your name, then click &quot;Patch&quot; but before restaring your computer, generate a file key in your name, then restart.\n4. Run the program and click &quot;File&quot; and go to &quot;Licensing&quot; and click &quot;update&quot; and &quot;Browse&quot; for the key in prog dir and open it, and press &quot;Apply&quot;, and restart.\n5. DONE!\n\n\n====================================================================================\nNote: If You Have Problem With Any Of my Torrents Register To My Site And PM Me About Your  Problem: &lt;a href=&quot; http://thumperdc.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thumperdc.org/&lt;/a&gt;\t\n====================================================================================\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b75dab1e64d2f595ec96eac613082298b315339e","amp;dn":"SuperSpeed+RamDisk+Plus+v11.6.795+%2B+Crack+%5BThumperDC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b75dab1e64d2f595ec96eac613082298b315339e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,93,171,30,100,210,245,149,236,150,234,198,19,8,34,152,179,21,51,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
