The entire 1900+ page epic!\n\nAll credit goes to TheHand-Empire for these releases! (I have no idea why the files are marked with &quot;2000&quot; or why Volume 2 has the wrong subtitle for its filename, but I left the names as I found them.)  --STF\n\n------\n\nFrom NerdBastards:\n\n&quot;DC Comics killed Superman to bring in readers, and they wanted to put Batman through yet another wringer to keep the publicity rolling. The result was Knightfall, which finds Batman getting his back broken by the new villain Bane and thus suffering what is perhaps his greatest nightmare: physical incapacity. Not all of Knightfall is brilliant, but the daring displayed by the array of artists and writers who worked on it is proof enough of its importance.&quot;\n\n------\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nAccompanying the release of the movie The Dark Knight Rises in 2012, DC Comics released a new edition of trade paperbacks collecting the Knightfall storyline. While the 1993 editions omitted the complete Knightsquest story arc, the 2012 editions collect part of this arc (&quot;The Crusade&quot; in volume 2) but leave &quot;The Search&quot; still uncollected. In addition, Bane's back story from the one-shot Vengeance of Bane is included in the first volume, providing a proper introduction of the character, and volume 3 sees the &quot;KnightsEnd&quot; and &quot;Prodigal&quot; arcs released in a single volume.\n\nBatman: Knightfall, Vol. 1 (includes all the material collected in 1993's Batman: Knightfall, Part One: Broken Bat and Batman: Knightfall, Part Two: Who Rules the Night with the addition of Vengeance of Bane, 640 pages, paperback 2012, ISBN 978-1401233792)\n\nBatman: Knightfall, Vol. 2: Knightquest (includes Detective Comics vol. 1 #667-675, Batman: Shadow of the Bat #19-20, 24-28, Batman vol. 1 #501-508, Catwoman vol. 2 #6-7 and Robin vol. 4 #7, 656 pages, paperback 2012, ISBN 978-1401235369)\n\nBatman: Knightfall, Vol. 3: KnightsEnd (includes all material collected in 1993s Batman: Knightfall, Part Three: KnightsEnd and 1998s Batman: Prodigal, 652 pages, ISBN 978-1401237219)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04e1c4ac871fae6e916a6afcfd43c4ad6f389315","amp;dn":"BATMAN+-+KNIGHTFALL+Volume+1+to+3+%28DC%29+%28Digital%29+%28TheHand-Empire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04e1c4ac871fae6e916a6afcfd43c4ad6f389315","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,225,196,172,135,31,174,110,145,106,106,252,253,67,196,173,111,56,147,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
