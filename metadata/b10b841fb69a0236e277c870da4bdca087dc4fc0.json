Please seed.\n\n\nSpartacus: Blood and Sand is a Starz television series that premiered on January 22, 2010. The series focuses on the historical figure of Spartacus (played by Andy Whitfield), a Thracian gladiator who from 73 to 71 BC led a major slave uprising against the Roman Republic. Executive producers Steven S. DeKnight and Robert Tapert focused on structuring the events of Spartacus' obscure early life leading up to the beginning of historical records. The show has been rated TV-MA for graphic violence, strong sexual content, and coarse language.\n\nThe show was initially renewed for a second season but production was delayed because Whitfield was diagnosed with early-stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Due to the delay, Starz produced a six-episode prequel series, entitled Spartacus: Gods of the Arena. Pre-production of season 2 began following the announcement that Whitfield was cancer free,however his cancer recurred. Starz has since replaced Whitfield with actor Liam McIntyre, who will play Spartacus for season two.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b10b841fb69a0236e277c870da4bdca087dc4fc0","amp;dn":"Spartacus+Blood+and+Sand+Season+1+Complete+%2B+Extras+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b10b841fb69a0236e277c870da4bdca087dc4fc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,11,132,31,182,154,2,54,226,119,200,112,218,75,220,160,135,220,79,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
