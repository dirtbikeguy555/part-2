The act achieved its greatest fame in the late 1970s and early to mid-1980s. They specialized in a fusion of rock and roll and rhythm and blues styles, which they dubbed &quot;rock and soul.&quot; Critics Stephen Thomas Erlewine &amp; J. Scott McClintock write[1], &quot;at their best, [Hall &amp; Oates's] songs were filled with strong hooks and melodies that adhered to soul traditions without being a slave to them by incorporating elements of new wave and hard rock.&quot;\n\nThey are best known for their six #1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100: &quot;Rich Girl&quot;, &quot;Kiss on My List&quot;, &quot;Private Eyes&quot;, &quot;I Can't Go for That (No Can Do)&quot;, &quot;Maneater&quot;, and &quot;Out of Touch&quot;, as well as many other songs which charted in the Top 40. They last reached the pop-charts top forty in 1990 and then slowly faded from public view, though they did not formally break up. They have continued to record and tour with some success. In total, the act had thirty-four singles chart on the US Billboard Hot 100. As of 2006, Hall and Oates have seven RIAA platinum albums, along with six RIAA gold albums.\n\nA greatest hits compilation was released in 2001 from Bertelsmann Music Group. The BMG collection was expanded in 2004 and reissued the following year, after BMG merged with Sony Music Entertainment. In 2003, Daryl Hall and John Oates were voted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nThroughout their musical career, the duo's album and single releases have been credited in various combinations, including: Hall &amp; Oates; Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates; Daryl Hall and John Oates; and Daryl Hall John Oates (no &quot;and&quot; separating the two names).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH20 1982\n\n\n\nH2O is the 1982 hit album from the duo Daryl Hall and John Oates. It featured three Top 10 U.S. singles, including &quot;Maneater&quot; which was the biggest hit of their career, spending four weeks at the #1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. The album title is a play on the chemical formula for water, where &quot;H&quot; is for Hall, and &quot;O&quot; is for Oates.\n\nH2O is certified double platinum by the RIAA with sales of over two million copies.[2] In 2009, Sony Music Custom Marketing Group released a triple pack of Hall &amp; Oates albums. Along with this album, the pack included Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates and Ooh Yeah.\n\n[b]Tracks: [/b]\n\n\n1.\t&quot;Maneater&quot; (Hall, Oates, Sara Allen) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:33\n2.\t&quot;Crime Pays&quot; (Hall, Oates, Sara Allen) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:31\n3.\t&quot;Art of Heartbreak&quot; (Hall, Sara Allen, Janna Allen) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:43\n4.\t&quot;One on One&quot; (Hall) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:17\n5.\t&quot;Open All Night&quot; (Hall, Sara Allen) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:35\n6.\t&quot;Family Man&quot; (Mike Oldfield, Tim Cross, Maggie Reilly, Rick Fenn, Mike Frye, Morris Pert) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n7.\t&quot;Italian Girls&quot; (Oates) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:17\n8.\t&quot;Guessing Games&quot; (Hall, Janna Allen) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:15\n9.\t&quot;Delayed Reaction&quot; (Hall, Oates, Sara Allen) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59\n10.\t&quot;At Tension&quot; (Oates) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:16\n11.\t&quot;Go Solo&quot; (Hall) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreatest Hits 1983\n\n\nRock 'n Soul Part 1 is a Greatest Hits album by Daryl Hall and John Oates, released in 1983.
