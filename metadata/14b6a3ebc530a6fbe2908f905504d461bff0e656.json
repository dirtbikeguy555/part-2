The Amazon reviews indicate that this book has errata. There was nothing listed on the publisher's website, so please discuss any questions with your lecturer, as I understand this is required reading for many courses. \nSome chapters have further information on the publisher's website to read online (links in book)\n\nTested on the above readers with no problems. Please allow a couple seconds for the seedboxes to kick in, then it should move pretty quick.\nHope it helps! :D\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nFor the intermediate-level course, this widely used text takes modern physics textbooks to a higher level. With a flexible approach to accommodate the various ways of teaching the course (both one- and two-term tracks are easily covered), the authors recognize the audience and its need for updated coverage, mathematical rigor, and features to build and support student understanding.\n\nContinued are the superb explanatory style, the up-to-date topical coverage, and the Web enhancements that gained earlier editions worldwide recognition. Enhancements include a streamlined approach to nuclear physics, thoroughly revised and updated coverage on particle physics and astrophysics, and a review of the essential Classical Concepts important to students studying Modern Physics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14b6a3ebc530a6fbe2908f905504d461bff0e656","amp;dn":"Modern+Physics-+Tipler%2C+Llewellyn+6E+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14b6a3ebc530a6fbe2908f905504d461bff0e656","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,182,163,235,197,48,166,251,226,144,143,144,85,4,212,97,191,240,230,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
