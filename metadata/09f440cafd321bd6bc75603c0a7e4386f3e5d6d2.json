After decades of slacking off at low-paying dead-end jobs, blowing his cash on booze and women, and scrimping by in flea-bitten apartments, Chinaski sees his poetic star rising at last. Now, at fifty, he is reveling in his sudden rock-star life, running three hundred hangovers a year, and maintaining a sex life that would cripple Casanova.\n\nWith all of Bukowski's trademark humor and gritty, dark honesty, this 1978 follow-up to Post Office and Factotum is an uncompromising account of life on the edge.\n\nPublisher: Ecco; Reprint edition (February 27, 2007)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0061177598\nISBN-13: 978-0061177590\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
