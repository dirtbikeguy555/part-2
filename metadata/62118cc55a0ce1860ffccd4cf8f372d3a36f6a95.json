They are fronted by singer Martyn Jacques who trained himself as an opera singer with a castrati style voice of heartbreaking beauty, whilst living alone above a strip joint in Soho for seven years.  Accompanied by drummer Adrian Huge, whose appearance was described by David Byrne as James Joyce on drums, and double bass player Adrian Stout, Jacques plays accordion and sings savage and passionate songs about prostitutes, drug addicts and losers, his voice soaring and growling like a man possessed. Ken Campbell has described him as &quot;the criminal castrati&quot;, and with his dickensian style of dress, long  pigtail and bowler hat, his corrosive lyrics and his astonishing voice, all the while singing with his eyes closed, he makes an indelible impression. Jacques sings about life at the bottom of contemporary Britain with the voice of an angel.\n\nThe music is a startling mixture of opera, gypsy song and  left bank Paris, but what really marks out this band from any other is the emotional charge and raw passion of the delivery. Because they are impossible to pigeonhole, the band has not yet had a wide commercial success, despite being picked up by David Byrne, with performances at the South  Bank, as well as festivals and foreign tours, but this cannot last for much longer as their reputation is spreading very fast in the art culture underworld.&quot;\n\nTorrent contains;\n\nContrastate &amp; The Tiger Lillies - Goodbye Great Nation [1996]\nThe Tiger Lillies - 17th of April 2007, Soho Theatre [2007]\nThe Tiger Lillies - Ad Nauseam [1995]\nThe Tiger Lillies &amp; Alexander Hacke - Mountains of Madness [2006]\nThe Tiger Lillies - Bad Blood and Blasphemy [1999]\nThe Tiger Lillies - Births, Marriages &amp; Deaths [1994]\nThe Tiger Lillies - Bouquet of Vegetables the Early Years [2000]\nThe Tiger Lillies - Circus Songs [2000]\nThe Tiger Lillies - Death and the Bible [2004]\nThe Tiger Lillies - Die Weberischen [2006-09-06]\nThe Tiger Lillies - Farmyard Filth [1997]\nThe Tiger Lillies - Live in Russia 2000-2001 [2003]\nThe Tiger Lillies - Live on WFMU (2004-11-03) [2004]\nThe Tiger Lillies - Love and War [2007]\nThe Tiger Lillies - Low Life Lullabies [1998]\nThe Tiger Lillies - Punch and Judy [2004]\nThe Tiger Lillies - Seven Deadly Sins [2008]\nThe Tiger Lillies - Shockheaded Peter_ A Junk Opera [1999]\nThe Tiger Lillies - Special Edition [2000]\nThe Tiger Lillies - Spit Bucket [1995]\nThe Tiger Lillies - The Brothel to the Cemetary [1998]\nThe Tiger Lillies - The Gorey End (feat.
