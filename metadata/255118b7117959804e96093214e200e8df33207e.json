Mind you: in the case of the new band, UNISONIC, an at least enthusiastic choice of words is certainly called for, in view of the fact that this exciting new group not only consists of accomplished masters of their genre Ã¢â‚¬â€œ namely Michael Kiske (vocals), Kai Hansen (guitar), Mandy Meyer (guitar), Dennis Ward (bass) and Kosta Zafiriou (drums) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but also of some of the most renowned musicians from the European rock and metal scene.\n\nNo wonder that a great stir has been caused behind the scenes (and occasionally also in front of them). Their first EP IGNITION has been scheduled for release on earMUSIC/Edel on 27 January 2012, followed by their eagerly awaited self-titled debut album on 23 March 2012. In view of the unmistakable media stir there can be no doubt: UNISONIC are currently on everybodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lips!\n\nThe artistic Ã¢â‚¬Å“antecedentÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of the five band members requires no explanation. As we all know, Michael Kiske was a member of Helloween between 1986 and 1993 and was responsible to a considerable degree for the international breakthrough of the band from Hamburg.\n\nKai Hansen was the guitarist and one of the main composers of Helloween before going on to found the successful Gamma Ray and continues to be considered a constant of the melodic metal community. Bassist Dennis Ward and drummer Kosta Zafiriou are familiar to fans and media from KarlsruheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Pink Cream 69, who experts have always considered the epitome of refined (rock music) taste.\nUnisonic - Light Of Dawn (2014)\n\n\nMichael Kiske (vocals)\nMandy Meyer (guitars)\nKai Hansen (guitars)\nDennis Ward (bass)\nKosta Zafiriou (drums)\n\n01.

Last but not least Mandy Meyer: the guitarist from Switzerland was a member of Gotthard from 1996 to 2004 and part of the Krokus fold until 2008.\n\nUNISONIC got together in autumn 2009, originally as a quartet (without Kai Hansen) and left their first artistic marks at the Masters Of Rock Festival in the Czech Republic and the Swedenrock Festival in summer 2010. Both performances were special for Michael Kiske in particular, who was in the mood for a proper band again following his successful collaboration with Dennis Ward and Kosta Zafiriou in Place Vendome: Ã¢â‚¬Å“No matter how good you are as a solo artist, a real band generates so much more energy and gave me a good reason to perform live again after 17 years.\n\nIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m thrilled to be able to play live with UNISONIC!Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ When Kiske found himself back on stage with Kai Hansen for the first time as a guest during AvantasiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world tour and the old magic between the two former Helloween musicians returned, the idea was born to expand the UNISONIC quartet into a quintet. Following unanimous approval from Meyer, Ward and Zafiriou, Hansen was confirmed as the permanent fifth man.\n\nThe band members agree that things cannot be done by halves in this band and that the group perspective will continue to have a high personal significance for all involved. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The world doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need another pure project,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ comments Kai Hansen, who Ã¢â‚¬â€œ together with Ward and Meyer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is responsible for the song writing in UNISONIC and has had a clear vision from the beginning: Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d define our style as a tougher variety of hard rock, sounding very flexible and diverse yet all of a piece.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:255118b7117959804e96093214e200e8df33207e","amp;dn":"Unisonic+-+Light+Of+Dawn++mp3++320k+++2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"255118b7117959804e96093214e200e8df33207e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,81,24,183,17,121,89,128,78,150,9,50,20,226,0,232,223,51,32,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
