Blending ecology, organic agriculture, green home design, appropriate technology, and biology can be confusing and overwhelming, but The Ultimate Guide to Natural Farming and Sustainable Living simplifies this vast field for practical application. This is a hands-on guide, taking the beginner through each step of the design process, so that anyone can apply permaculture principles to his or her life. While the principles are simple, the in-depth topics cover every aspect of permaculture, including:\r\n\r\nâ€¢ building green homes and passive solar design\r\nâ€¢ growing edible plant communities and forest gardens\r\nâ€¢ using no-till and natural farming methods\r\nâ€¢ creating microclimates for extended growing seasons\r\nâ€¢ raising livestock with ecological foraging techniques\r\n\r\nThis is a common-sense approach to sustainable living that creates a self-sufficient and low-effort home for the people that live there, whether in the city or the country. The Ultimate Guide to Natural Farming and Sustainable Living isnâ€™t a philosophy book or a dissertation on theory. It is a step-by-step, complete guide to every aspect of permaculture.\r\n\r\nAbout the Author\r\nNicole Faires was born in Tucson, Arizona, to a semi-nomadic homeschooling family. After traveling over most of the western U.S., they finally settled in Montana where she grew her own food, made her own clothes and ruined her teenage social life. She is an adventurer, self-proclaimed eccentric, wife, and mother of three girls. She grew up in a semi-nomadic homeschooling family and spent her early years in rural Montana on a hobby farm where she raised chickens, grew her own food, learned to crochet, read out-of-print books by Masanobu Fukuoka, and dreamed of the Amish. She is the author of The Ultimate Guide to Homesteading and The Ultimate Guide to Permaculture and continues to seek new adventures and local food with her family in beautiful British Columbia.\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\nIntroduction\r\nPart 1What is Permaculture?\r\nPart 2 Energy\r\nPart 3 Water\r\nPart 4 Homes and Shelter\r\nPart 5 Gardens\r\nPart 6 Cooking and Preserving\r\nPart 7 The Zones\r\nPart 8 Community\r\nPart 9 Plants\r\nBibliography\r\nIndex\r\n \nhttp://s23.postimg.org/7pl6czgcb/cover.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21ac5b1731ae4f4883678d73342df908d8ec7a8b","amp;dn":"The+Ultimate+Guide+to+Natural+Farming+%26amp%3B+Sustainable+Living+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21ac5b1731ae4f4883678d73342df908d8ec7a8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,172,91,23,49,174,79,72,131,103,141,115,52,45,249,8,216,236,122,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
