Their intention is to go beyond any limit that metal music sub-genres might have these days and create the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most extreme progressive metal band.\n\nThey define themselves through the field of tension created between musical opposites. All band members are active death metal musicians who nevertheless all have a much broader view of music than blast beats and growls. They establish from the beginning that they have many faces, and that oscillating between (seemingly) contrary or mutually exclusive styles is an important factor. ALKALOID set out to push the boundaries of progressive, extreme music on their impressive full-length debut The Malkuth Grimoire\n\n\nhe lineup consists of:\n\n    Morean (Dark Fortress, Noneuclid) - Vocals, Guitars\n    Christian Muenzner (Spawn of Possession, Ex-Obscura, Ex-Necrophagist) - Guitars\n    Danny Tunker (Aborted, Ex-God Dethroned) - Guitars\n    Linus Klausenitzer (Obscura, Noneuclid) - Bass\n    Hannes Grossmann (Blotted Science, Ex-Obscura, Ex-Necrophagist) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Drums\n\n\nAlkaloid - The Malkuth Grimoire (2015)ak (Size: 168.97 MB)\n  \t\t12 - Funeral For a Continent.mp3 \t28.36 MB\n  \t\t01 - Carbon Phrases.mp3 \t21.93 MB\n  \t\t02 - From a Hadron Machinist.mp3 \t21.43 MB\n  \t\t05 - Orgonism.mp3 \t19.66 MB\n  \t\t10 - The Malkuth Grimoire.mp3 \t13.72 MB\n  \t\t03 - Cthulhu.mp3 \t13.32 MB\n  \t\t06 - Dyson Sphere - I.Mining the Oorth Cloud.mp3 \t10.08 MB\n  \t\t09 - Dyson Sphere - IV.Sol Omega.mp3 \t9.29 MB\n  \t\t04 - Alter Magnitudes.mp3 \t9.05 MB\n  \t\t08 - Dyson Sphere - III.Kardashev 2.1 The God Oven.mp3 \t8.28 MB\n  \t\t07 - Dyson Sphere - II.Assembly.mp3 \t7.19 MB\n  \t\t11 - C-Value Enigma.mp3 \t6.52 MB\n  \t\tCover.jpg \t133.32 KB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e3239583fcbfd7d2343a710a9c9a885e10b4f71","amp;dn":"Alkaloid+-+The+Malkuth+Grimoire+2015++ak6103","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e3239583fcbfd7d2343a710a9c9a885e10b4f71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,50,57,88,63,203,253,125,35,67,167,16,169,201,168,133,225,11,79,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
