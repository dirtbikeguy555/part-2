After leaving, Austin decided to start something new on his own. He asked one of his best friends Jaxin Hall from New Zealand, to join him and be apart of whatever he did next.\nThe two, got their friends in Though She Wrote, to help them write and record the song &quot;Seven Thousand Miles for What?&quot; they had been working on. The next day they posted it and made this myspace.\nFive days later the inevitable happened. They joined up with the two people that had stood by them since day one. Rise and Artery were always considered family, and after hearing the song, they accepted us into theirs. \nSolidifying the line up with Valentino Arteaga from Lower Definition on drums, Shayley Bourget from Chapters and Covette on guitar and vocals, and Phil Manansala from A Static Lullaby on guitar, Of Mice &amp; Men have already recorded their debut album to be released in February 2010 and have hit the road nonstop! \n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGet on it, this album is epic and sees a nice departure from all the generic crap we hear nowadays...but thats just my opinion ;)\n\nDont forget to BUY their cd if you like it...and PLEASE SEED!!!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49c8936e2c75ace0b8946ded833320e7c739858c","amp;dn":"Of+Mice+%26+Men+-+Of+Mice+and+Men+%5B2010%5D+%5B320+kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49c8936e2c75ace0b8946ded833320e7c739858c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,200,147,110,44,117,172,224,184,148,109,237,131,51,32,231,199,57,133,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
