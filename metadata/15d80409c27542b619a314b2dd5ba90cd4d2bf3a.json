Use your favorite burning program to create your disc. If you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have one, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d recommend ImgBurn as simple and easy to use.\n\nIf you want the files on your computer and arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sure how to get them there without burning the DVD first, look up Daemon tools. This can be used to mount the iso file as a virtual drive on your computer, from which you can rip and convert as normal. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15d80409c27542b619a314b2dd5ba90cd4d2bf3a","amp;dn":"Insanity+disc+7+Max+Interval+Circuit+%26amp%3B+Fit+Test","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15d80409c27542b619a314b2dd5ba90cd4d2bf3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,216,4,9,194,117,66,182,25,163,20,178,221,91,169,12,212,210,191,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
