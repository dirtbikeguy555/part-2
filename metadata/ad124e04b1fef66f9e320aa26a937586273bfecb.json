TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re intelligent, skilled, and even charismatic. But only a handful of them will ever reach the pinnacle   and as executive coach Marshall Goldsmith shows in this book, subtle nuances make all the difference. These are small &quot;transactional flaws&quot; performed by one person against another (as simple as not saying thank you enough), which lead to negative perceptions that can hold any executive back. Using GoldsmithÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s straightforward, jargon-free advice, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s amazingly easy behavior to change.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad124e04b1fef66f9e320aa26a937586273bfecb","amp;dn":"+What+Got+You+Here+Won%27t+Get+You+There%3A+How+Successful+People","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad124e04b1fef66f9e320aa26a937586273bfecb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,18,78,4,177,254,246,111,158,50,10,162,106,147,117,134,39,59,254,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
