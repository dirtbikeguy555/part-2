Ordered against her will to become a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sparrow,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a trained seductress, Dominika is assigned to operate against Nathaniel Nash, a young CIA officer who handles the AgencyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most important Russian mole.\n\nSpies have long relied on the Ã¢â‚¬Å“honey trap,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ whereby vulnerable men and women are intimately compromised. Dominika learns these techniques of Ã¢â‚¬Å“sexpionageÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in RussiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s secret Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sparrow School,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ hidden outside of Moscow. As the action careens between Russia, Finland, Greece, Italy, and the United States, Dominika and Nate soon collide in a duel of wills, tradecraft, andÃ¢â‚¬â€inevitablyÃ¢â‚¬â€forbidden passion that threatens not just their lives but those of others as well.

Soon one of them begins a dangerous double existence in a life-and-death operation that consumes intelligence agencies from Moscow to Washington, DC.\n\nPage by page, veteran CIA officer Jason MatthewsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Red Sparrow delights and terrifies and fascinates, all while delivering an unforgettable cast, from a sadistic Spetsnaz Ã¢â‚¬Å“mechanicÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ who carries out PutinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s murderous schemes to the weary CIA Station Chief who resists Washington Ã¢â‚¬Å“cake-eatersÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to MARBLE, the priceless Russian mole. Packed with insider detail and written with brio, this tour-de-force novel brims with MatthewsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life experience, including his knowledge of espionage, counterintelligence, surveillance tradecraft, spy recruitment, cyber-warfare, the Russian use of Ã¢â‚¬Å“spy dust,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and covert communications.
