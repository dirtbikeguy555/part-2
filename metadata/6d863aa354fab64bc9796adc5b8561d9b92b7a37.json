In many cases, the source of evil has been personified as demons or devils, and in many belief systems, both are considered to be real entities operating outside the boundaries of the physical world to torment people or lead them astray. In some traditions demons are believed to be the direct opposite of angels, working against the forces of good and challenging them. Real or not, demons are at the heart of many fascinating beliefs and traditions, several of which are widely held today.\n\n\n\nAuthor(s):\tRosemary Guiley, John Zaffis\nPublisher:\t\nDate:\t2009\nPages:\t302\nFormat:\tpdf\nISBN13:\t9780816073146\nISBN10:\t0816073147\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d863aa354fab64bc9796adc5b8561d9b92b7a37","amp;dn":"The+Encyclopedia+of+Demons+and+Demonology","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d863aa354fab64bc9796adc5b8561d9b92b7a37","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,134,58,163,84,250,182,75,201,121,106,220,91,133,97,217,185,43,122,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
