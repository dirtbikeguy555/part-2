They maybe two of the biggest mega movie stars in the world, but they're also great parents, philanthropists and just all-around good people.\n\nWhen they disappear without a word from their ranch, facts are hard to find. They live behind such a high wall of security and image control that even world-renowned Private Investigator Jack Morgan can't get to the truth. But as Jack keeps probing, secrets sprout thick and fast--and the world's golden couple may emerge as hiding behind a world of desperation and deception that the wildest reality show couldn't begin to unveil. Murder is only the opening scene.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1709475c8e8aeca75965874f46dcb1e6c596080","amp;dn":"Private+L.+A.+by+James+Patterson+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1709475c8e8aeca75965874f46dcb1e6c596080","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,112,148,117,200,232,174,202,117,150,88,116,244,109,203,30,108,89,96,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
