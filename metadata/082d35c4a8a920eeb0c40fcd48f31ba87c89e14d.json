It built on ideas explored in the band's earlier recordings and live shows,\nbut lacks the extended instrumental excursions that characterised their work following the departure in 1968\nof founder member, principal composer, and lyricist, Syd Barrett. The Dark Side of the Moon's themes include conflict,\ngreed, the passage of time, and mental illness, the latter partly inspired by Barrett's deteriorating mental state.\nDeveloped during live performances, an early version of the suite was premiered several months \nbefore studio recording began; new material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at Abbey Road Studios in London. \nThe group used some of the most advanced recording techniques of the time, including multitrack recording and tape loops\nAnalogue synthesizers were given prominence in several tracks, and a series of recorded interviews \nwith the band's road crew and others provided the philosophical quotations used throughout. Engineer Alan Parsons was directly responsible\nfor some of the most notable sonic aspects of the album as well as the recruitment of non-lexical performer Clare Torry\nThe album's iconic sleeve, designed by Storm Thorgerson, features a prism that represents the band's stage lighting\nthe record's lyrical themes, and keyboardist Richard Wright's request for a &quot;simple and bold&quot; design.\nThe Dark Side of the Moon was an immediate success, topping the Billboard Top LPs &amp; Tapes chart for one week.\nIt subsequently remained in the charts for 741 weeks from 1973 to 1988. With an estimated 50 million copies sold\nit is Pink Floyd's most commercially successful album and one of the best-selling albums worldwide.\nIt has twice been remastered and re-released, and has been covered in its entirety by several other acts.\nIt spawned two singles, &quot;Money&quot; and &quot;Time&quot;. In addition to its commercial success, The Dark Side of the Moon is one of Pink Floyd's most popular\nalbums among fans and critics, and is frequently ranked as one of the greatest albums of all time.\n=======================================================\nTracklist:\nThe Dark Side of the Moon\n1.Pink Floyd - Speak to Me/Breath\n2.Pink Floyd - On the Run \n3.Pink Floyd - Time \n4.Pink Floyd - The Great Gig in the Sky\n5.Pink Floyd - Money \n6.Pink Floyd - Us and Them \n7.Pink Floyd - Any Colour You Like\n8.Pink Floyd - Brain Damage \n9.Pink Floyd - Eclipse \n=======================================================\nAudio Specifications:\nFormat________________________________: MPEG Audio\nFormat profile________________________: Layer 3\nMode__________________________________: Joint stereo\nBit rate mode_________________________: Constant\nBit rate______________________________: 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)____________________________: 2 channels\nSampling rate_________________________: 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode______________________: Lossy\n=======================================================\n&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;\nEnjoy This LiMited Release Brouth up by &quot;Pirata-Tuga&quot;\nFeel free to give your Vote up and a comment,if you Deslike or Have Suggestions to improve Something Don't get Angry!&quot;Just leave a comment so we can work On it.\nPlease SEED for others to Enjoy!
