Produced by veteran producer Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange, the album was released by A&amp;M/Octone Records on September 21, 2010. On July 12, 2011, the band re-released the album to include their summer hit &quot;Moves like Jagger&quot;.[2] The lead single, &quot;Misery&quot;, was released in June 2010. &quot;Give a Little More&quot; followed as the second single in August 2010, &quot;Never Gonna Leave This Bed&quot; as the third single in January 2011, and &quot;Moves like Jagger&quot; as the fourth and final single in June 2011. The album received generally mixed reviews from music critics, though many of them praised it for its production. Some critics have noted that the album features more of a soulful style than Maroon 5's previous works. Maroon 5 went on tour in the summer of 2011, to promote the album..\n\n \n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Misery\n[02] Give A Little More\n[03] Stutter\n[04] Don't Know Nothing\n[05] Never Gonna Leave This Bed\n[06] I Can't Lie\n[07] Hands All Over\n[08] How\n[09] Get Back In My Life\n[10] Just A Feeling\n[11] Runaway\n[12] Out Of Goodbyes - - - Maroon 5 With Lady Antebellum\n[13] Crazy Little Thing Called Love (Acoustic)\n\nPlay Time - 00h:43m:42s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 340mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
