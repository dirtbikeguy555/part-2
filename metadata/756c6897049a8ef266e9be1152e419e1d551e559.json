The band consists of frontman and co-founder Chris &quot;OJ&quot; Ojeda (rhythm guitar, vocals), Brian Henderson (guitar), Matt Wolfe (drums) and Sean Sydnor (bass guitar).\n\nThey have released three studio albums on Prosthetic Records and one independently. Byzantine are widely hailed as the most underrated band from the New Wave of American Heavy Metal movement.\n\nDue to various circumstances the band reported their split on January 26, 2008, 1 day after the release of their third album, then reunited in 2010. Byzantine is known for its unique sound, modern and &quot;forward thinking&quot; musical style, which explores different musical territories and song structures.\n\nOn January 26, 2012 the band announced that they are recording a new album, 4 years after they disbanded.\n\nTracklist\n\n01.
