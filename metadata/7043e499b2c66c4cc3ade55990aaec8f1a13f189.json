Learn how to build your own 3D models, characters, and prototypes with the NURBS-based modeling tools in Rhino 5.0 for Windows. Author Dave Schultze introduces Rhino's three primary entities (the curve, the surface, and the solid) and shows the best ways to draw curves and model 3D objects, edit their geometry efficiently, and render and export your designs.\nTopics include:\n\n    Why use Rhino?\n    Understanding 3D terminology\n    Comparing BÃƒÂ©zier curves, B-splines, and NURBS objects\n    Navigating the viewport\n    Manipulating objects with commands\n    Creating curves, surfaces, and solids\n    Performing basic transformations\n    Making solids with primitives\n    Extruding curves\n    Snapping to objects and planes\n    Trimming, splitting, rotating, and copying objects\n    Working with NURBS and seams\n    Prototyping a 3D model\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7043e499b2c66c4cc3ade55990aaec8f1a13f189","amp;dn":"Lynda-+Rhino+5+Essential+Training","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7043e499b2c66c4cc3ade55990aaec8f1a13f189","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,67,228,153,178,198,108,76,195,173,229,89,144,170,236,143,26,19,241,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
