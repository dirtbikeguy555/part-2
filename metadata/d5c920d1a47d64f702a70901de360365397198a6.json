Through a series of MATLABÃ‚Â® programs, the author explores each of the enabling technologies, pedagogically synthesizes an LTE PHY system model, and evaluates system performance at each stage. Following this step-by-step process, readers will achieve deeper understanding of LTE concepts and specifications through simulations.\n\nKey Features:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Accessible, intuitive, and progressive; one of the few books to focus primarily on the modeling, simulation, and implementation of the LTE PHY standard\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Includes case studies and testbenches in MATLABÃ‚Â®, which build knowledge gradually and incrementally until a functional specification for the LTE PHY is attained\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Accompanying Web site includes all MATLABÃ‚Â® programs, together with PowerPoint slides and other illustrative examples\n\nDr Houman Zarrinkoub has served as a development manager and now as a senior product manager with MathWorks, based in Massachusetts, USA. Within his 12 years at MathWorks, he has been responsible for multiple signal processing and communications software tools. Prior to MathWorks, he was a research scientist in the Wireless Group at Nortel Networks, where he contributed to multiple standardization projects for 3G mobile technologies. He has been awarded multiple patents on topics related to computer simulations.
