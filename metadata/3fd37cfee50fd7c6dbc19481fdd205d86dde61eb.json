But now the beloved family doctor and pillar of the community is accused of murdering Violet Turner, the beautiful nurse with whom he worked in the dark days of the early 1960s. A fighter who has always stood for justice, Penn is determined to save his father, even though Tom, stubbornly evoking doctor-patient privilege, refuses to speak up in his own defense.\n\nThe quest for answers sends Penn deep into the pastÃ¢â‚¬â€into the heart of a conspiracy of greed and murder involving the Double Eagles, a vicious KKK crew headed by one of the wealthiest and most powerful men in the state. With the aid of a local friend and reporter privy to some of Natchez's oldest and deadliest secrets, Penn follows a bloody trail that stretches back forty years, to one undeniable fact: no oneÃ¢â‚¬â€black or white, young or old, brave or notÃ¢â‚¬â€is ever truly safe.\n\nWith everything on the line, including his own life, Penn must decide how far he will go to protect those he loves . . . and see justice done, once and for all.\n\nRich in Southern atmosphere and electrifying plot turns, Natchez Burning marks the brilliant return of a genuine American master of suspense. Tense and disturbing, it is the most explosive, exciting, sexy, and ambitious story Greg Iles has written yet.\n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre reader ready.
