Today we call that dialect Old English, the ancestor of the language nearly one in five people in the world speaks every day.\n\nHow did this ancient tongue evolve into the elegant idiom of Chaucer, Shakespeare, Twain, Melville, and other great writers? What features of modern English spelling and vocabulary link it to its Old English roots? How did English grammar become so streamlined? Why did its pronunciation undergo such drastic changes? How do we even know what English sounded like in the distant past? And how does English continue to develop to the present day?\n\n36 Lectures\n30 minutes / lecture\n\n\n1 Introduction to the Study of Language\n2 The Historical Study of Language\n3 Indo-European and the Prehistory of English\n4 Reconstructing Meaning and Sound\n5 Historical Linguistics and Studying Culture\n6 The Beginnings of English\n7 The Old English Worldview\n8 Did the Normans Really Conquer English?\n9 What Did the Normans Do to English?\n10 Chaucer's English\n11 Dialect Representations in Middle English\n12 Medieval Attitudes toward Language\n13 The Return of English as a Standard\n14 The Great Vowel Shift and Modern English\n15 The Expanding English Vocabulary\n16 Early Modern English Syntax and Grammar\n17 Renaissance Attitudes toward Teaching English\n18 ShakespeareÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Drama, Grammar, Pronunciation\n19 ShakespeareÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Poetry, Sound, Sense\n20 The Bible in English\n21 Samuel Johnson and His Dictionary\n22 New Standards in English\n23 Dictionaries and Word Histories\n24 Values, Words, and Modernity\n25 The Beginnings of American English\n26 American Language from Webster to Mencken\n27 American Rhetoric from Jefferson to Lincoln\n28 The Language of the American Self\n29 American Regionalism\n30 American Dialects in Literature\n31 The Impact of African-American English\n32 An Anglophone World\n33 The Language of Science\n34 The Science of Language\n35 Linguistics and Politics in Language Study\n36 Conclusions and Provocations \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:043403d33e3a99cbb743b9ee91cb5dfe501f64bb","amp;dn":"TTC+-+History+of+the+English+Language%2C+2nd+Edition+-+Seth+Lerer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"043403d33e3a99cbb743b9ee91cb5dfe501f64bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,52,3,211,62,58,153,203,183,67,185,238,145,203,93,254,80,31,100,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
