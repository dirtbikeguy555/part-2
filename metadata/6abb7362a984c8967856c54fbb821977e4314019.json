Every day he goes through the motions, becoming increasingly detached from those around him. His best friend Dan thinks he has the answer, a mysterious video he's got to see to believe. What Dan shows him leaves Tom unsettled, flooding his mind with disturbing images and desires, and binding the two friends together with its ugly secret. As he tries desperately to forget what he saw, Tom's mounting feelings of guilt and disillusionment quickly give way to paranoia and fear. One video soon follows another and another, blurring the line between reality and voyeuristic fascination, and threatening to dismantle everything around them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6abb7362a984c8967856c54fbb821977e4314019","amp;dn":"Gut+%282012%29+1080p+BrRip+x264+-+YIFY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6abb7362a984c8967856c54fbb821977e4314019","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,187,115,98,169,132,200,150,120,86,197,79,187,130,25,119,228,49,64,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
