This concise book guides you into and through JavaScript, written by a veteran programmer who once found himself in the same position.\nSpeaking JavaScript helps you approach the language with four standalone sections. First, a quick-start guide teaches you just enough of the language to help you be productive right away. More experienced JavaScript programmers will find a complete and easy-to-read reference that covers each language feature in depth. Complete contents include:\nJavaScript quick start: Familiar with object-oriented programming? This part helps you learn JavaScript quickly and properly.\n    JavaScript in depth: Learn details of ECMAScript 5, from syntax, variables, functions, and object-oriented programming to regular expressions and JSON with lots of examples. Pick a topic and jump in.\n    Background: Understand JavaScriptÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s history and its relationship with other programming languages.\n    Tips, tools, and libraries: Survey existing style guides, best practices, advanced techniques, module systems, package managers, build tools, and learning resources.\n\n-------------\nKeep Learning and help us to share the Knowledge across the World.\n-------------\nMore Ebooks\ntweet us @teamGOLU &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/GOLU&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/GOLU&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ba86337d93149cb26b89107d67865062e50b2fc","amp;dn":"Speaking+JavaScript+-+O%27Reilly+%282014%29+PDF+EPUB+-+GOLU","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ba86337d93149cb26b89107d67865062e50b2fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,168,99,55,217,49,73,203,38,184,145,7,214,120,101,6,46,80,178,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
