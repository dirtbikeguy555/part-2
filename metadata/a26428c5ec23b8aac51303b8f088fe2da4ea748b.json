Archive format is 7zip. To play, simply extract the &quot;Common.7z&quot; file and the file appropriate for your OS - either &quot;Windows.7z&quot;, &quot;Windows64.7z&quot;, &quot;Mac.7z&quot;, or &quot;Linux.7z&quot;.\r\nTotal extracted data for a single OS is about 2.2GB. Feel free to extract multiple OS files on top of each other - they don't conflict (the 32 bit launcher is included in both Windows and Windows64, but are exactly the same so just overwrite).\r\nHave fun :D\r\nExecutables aren't compressed so all file hashes should match exactly to the official release - no viruses! (if they were compressed further, another 80MB could have been saved)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a26428c5ec23b8aac51303b8f088fe2da4ea748b","amp;dn":"KSP+Kerba+Program+1.1.3+%5BWin%2FMac%2FLinux%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a26428c5ec23b8aac51303b8f088fe2da4ea748b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,100,40,197,236,35,184,170,197,19,3,184,240,136,254,45,164,234,116,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
