This is not bad, because it lets you quickly accommodate and just enjoy desired items. These are easily added by dragging them over the main window, as well as through a dedicated menu for individual files or the whole content of a directory.\r\n\r\nPlayback options are clearly visible, as well as the progress and volume sliders. By default, you only gain access to the previously mentioned elements and a preview sections, with the possibility to bring up other available features.\r\nCreate and manage playlists\r\n\r\nOne of the features that is a must for any media player is also found here. A playlist manager can be brought up so that you can create a list with various selections you can later load. The application lets you import other playlist formats, as well as from Windows Media Player.\r\n\r\nIn addition, you are able to set files you frequently play as favorites so you don't have to bring up an entire playlist for one element, or browse through your computer.\r\n\r\nSupports a large variety of formats\r\n\r\nProbably the application's main advantage and what keeps it at the top is that it is capable of rendering nearly all available media file formats. From video types like AVI, MPG, MOV, SWF to audio formats MP3, OGG, FLAC and several playlist types, you need only sit back and enjoy whatever file you provide.\r\n\r\nChanges in version 1.7.10\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nThis release is a bugfix release, with many improvements and a few new features.\r\n\r\n*** Completely new Internal Audio Renderer:\r\n\r\n- Uses sanear project as backend\r\n- Requires Windows Vista or newer\r\n- Outputs sound through WASAPI (shared or exclusive)\r\n- Employs automatic channel downmixing\r\n- Provides stereo crossfeed processing option (for headphones)\r\n- Tries to preserve signal pitch when playing at custom rate (time stretching)\r\n- Supports bitstreaming\r\n\r\nNote that you need to select the new renderer in options in order to use it\r\n\r\n*** Windows 10 related fixes:\r\n\r\n- Improved mouse behavior\r\n- Fixed volume control with scroll wheel\r\n- Window snapping to desktop edges\r\n\r\n*** Allow hardware decoding of UHD video with AMD cards\r\n*** Big video rendering stability improvement\r\n*** New Indonesian, Lithuanian and Punjabi translations.\r\n\r\nHomepage https://mpc-hc.org/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f3b56d2c5a15502c60da024f52515d7c82086e5","amp;dn":"Media+Player+Classic+Home+Cinema+1.7.10+%2B+Standalone+Filters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f3b56d2c5a15502c60da024f52515d7c82086e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,59,86,210,197,161,85,2,198,13,160,36,245,37,21,215,200,32,134,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
