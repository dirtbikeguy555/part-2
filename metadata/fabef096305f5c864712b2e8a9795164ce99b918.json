Enjoy making albums with SmartAlbums. The fastest, easiest and most intuitive album design software available. WeÃ¢Â€â„¢ve made it easy so you can get back to the things you love.\r\n\r\nExport to Photoshop &amp; InDesign\r\nExport to Adobe Photoshop and Adobe InDesign in fully layered PSD &amp; IDML formats to seamlessly connect SmartAlbums to your current workflow.\r\n\r\nTemplate Popularity\r\nChoose to show your top templates more often by â€œfavoritingâ€ them, and hide others by opting to â€œrejectâ€.\r\n\r\nResize Album\r\nChange the album size of your design at any time, allowing for fast and easy album upgrades and changes.\r\n\r\nImport Formats\r\nImport a wide range of file formats, including JPG, TIFF, PNG, and PSD.\r\n\r\nLightroom and Bridge Ratings\r\nAdobe Lightroom and Adobe Bridge star ratings and color labels are imported along with your images, allowing you to sort the images based on those ratings.\r\n\r\nGap Control\r\nSmartAlbums enables you to be very precise with the spacing between images, ensuring gap consistency throughout the album.\r\n\r\nFace Detection\r\nWhen an image must be cropped, such as with square frames, SmartAlbums automatically repositions the image inside the frame to avoid cropping faces.\r\n\r\nHandcrafted Templates\r\nHuman beings perceive beauty; computers donÃ¢Â€â„¢t. This is why every single layout in SmartAlbums is hand crafted by a professional graphic artist, not a mathematical algorithm.\r\n\r\nWhat's New in Version 2.2.1:\r\nFixes and Improvements\r\n- Fixed upload errors for Cloud Proofing albums containing '&amp;' character in album names.\r\n- When using menu item 'Copy Filenames', the filenames no longer include the extensions (can now be used in Adobe Lightroom).\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements:\r\nMinimum\r\n- OS: Windows 7 SP1 (64-bit)\r\n- CPU: Intel Core 2 Duo E6600 @ 2.4 GHz (dual-core)\r\n- RAM: 6GB\r\n- GPU: DirectX 10, OpenGL 2.1 compatible\r\n\r\nRecommended\r\n- OS: Windows 10 (64-bit)\r\n- CPU: Intel Core i5-3470 @ 3.2 GHz (quad-core)\r\n- RAM: 16GB\r\n- GPU: DirectX 10, OpenGL 2.1 compatible","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fabef096305f5c864712b2e8a9795164ce99b918","amp;dn":"Pixellu+SmartAlbums+2.2.2+%28x64%29+%2B+Crack+%5BSadeemPC%5D.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fabef096305f5c864712b2e8a9795164ce99b918","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,190,240,150,48,95,92,134,71,18,178,232,169,121,81,100,206,153,185,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
