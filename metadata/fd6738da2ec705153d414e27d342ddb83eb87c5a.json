This book is also suitable for all readers interested in economics.\n\nThoroughly updated, stripped of technical detail where possible, extensively illustrated with well-chosen photographs, enlivened with new applications features that focus on issues at play in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world, responsive to the suggestions of reviewers and users, and seamlessly integrated with MyEconLab: These are the hallmarks of this eleventh edition of Microeconomics.\n\nParkin brings critical issues to the forefront. Each chapter begins with one of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s key issues, and additional issues appear throughout the chapter to show the real-world applications of the theory being discussed. When the chapter concludes, readers Ã¢â‚¬Å“read between the linesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to think critically about a news article relating to the issue, demonstrating how thinking like an economist can bring a clearer perspective to and deeper understanding of todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s events. Readers will begin to think about issues the way real economists do and learn how to explore difficult policy problems and make more informed decisions in their own economic lives.\n\nNote: the standalone textbook does not automatically include MyEconLab with the text.
