Forget about the higher price and the fact that 40 songs might seem to be more Drifters than most casual listeners would want â€“ All-Time Greatest Hits &amp; More: 1959-1965 is a towering and magnificent collection of some of the best popular R&amp;B ever done this side of Sam Cooke. \r\n\r\nAnd, as with Sam Cooke, the beautiful part of the Drifters' work during this period is that any look beyond and behind their hits reveals a lot more songs that were every bit as good as those hits. There's not even a slightly weak track anywhere on All-Time Greatest Hits &amp; More, which contains the biggest hits Ben E. King, Rudy Lewis, and Johnny Moore sang for the group.\r\n\r\n&quot;There Goes My Baby,&quot; &quot;This Magic Moment,&quot; &quot;Save the Last Dance for Me,&quot; &quot;Sweets for My Sweet,&quot; &quot;I Count the Tears,&quot; &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful,&quot; &quot;Up on the Roof,&quot; &quot;On Broadway,&quot; and &quot;Under the Boardwalk&quot; are all here, mastered in surprisingly good sound for the late '80s. \r\n\r\nThere's a lot more than that, however â€“ the producers have also included killer B-sides (such as &quot;Let the Music Play&quot;) that hadn't been in print since the mid-'60s, and they've dug even deeper to throw in finished tracks that were left in the vaults until the '70s. The notes by Colin Escott are an added bonus, displaying his usual command for historical detail.\r\n\r\nCD1\r\n01. There Goes My Baby \r\n02. Oh My Love \r\n03. Baltimore \r\n04.
