Wireless Password Recovery is the only software solution that employs the most advanced password recovery methods developed in our company.\n\nWPA and WPA2 wireless network standards, if configured properly, provide sufficient security of personal information. However to maintain the proper security of a wireless network, all the components of the system must be periodically audited. Wireless Password Recovery is not the utility to hack wifi password, but instead allows you to find and identify weak spots of your wireless network, conduct audits of its security, recover forgotten WPA-PSK (Pre-Shared Key) and WPA2-PSK passwords of your home network.\n\nFeatures:\n\nContemporary, customizable graphical interface.\nBuilt-in support for password search using both CPU and GPU power.\nOver 10 types of password recovery, many of which have been developed by and implemented in our companys products only.\nAdvanced audit reports.\nAdditional tools, including powerful utilities for creating and managing dictionaries. For example, you can create your own wordlists by indexing the files on your hard disk drive.\nOn the fly decryption of some WPA/WPA2 hashes.\nSupports for long (up to 255 character) passwords.
