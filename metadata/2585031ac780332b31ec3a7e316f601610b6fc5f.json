Earth and the other planets in our solar system form out of the remaining bits of matter swirling around the new star.\n\nAt 67 million years ago, an asteroid collides with the Earth, wiping out the dinosaurs, and leaves territory open for the rise of a minor order of organisms, the early mammals.\n\nAt 100,000ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“60,000 years ago, a species of hominines-bipedal ape-like creatures- begins to move out of its home territory in Africa and into the Asian continent.\n\nToday, the descendants of those first hominines-homo sapiens-live in nearly every ecological niche. We fly through the air in planes, communicate instantaneously over immense distances, and develop theories about the creation of the Universe.\n\nEach of these scenarios is just one episode in an ever-evolving story: the history of everything. It's a story you'll hear-in its monumental entirety-in Big History: The Big Bang, Life on Earth, and the Rise of Humanity.\n\nTaught by historian David Christian, Big History offers a unique opportunity to view human history in the context of the many histories that surround it. Over the course of 48 thought-provoking lectures, he'll serve as your guide as you traverse the sweeping expanse of cosmic history-13.7 billion years of it-starting with the big bang and traveling through time and space to the present moment.\n\n\n48 lectures\n30 minutes / lecture","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2585031ac780332b31ec3a7e316f601610b6fc5f","amp;dn":"TTC+-+Big+History+-The+Big+Bang%2C+Life+on+Earth%2C+and+the+Rise+of+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2585031ac780332b31ec3a7e316f601610b6fc5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,133,3,26,199,128,51,43,49,236,58,126,49,111,96,22,16,182,252,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
