Surrounding the town the villains make repeated runs at the tiny jailhouse where their comrade is incarcerated. The sheriff John T. Chance (Wayne), is left to defend the territory almost single-handedly -- his only aid being a rag-tag crew of misfits including his sobering-up alcoholic friend Dude (Dean Martin), an old cripple deputy-sidekick Stumpy (Walter Brennan),a saloon woman (Angie Dickinson), and the hotshot new kid Colorado (Ricky Nelson)\n  When it comes down to naming the best Western of all time, the list usually narrows to three completely different pictures: John Ford's The Searchers, Howard Hawks's Red River, and Hawks's Rio Bravo. About the only thing they all have in common is that they all star John Wayne.\n\n  Starring: John Wayne, Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, Angie Dickinson, Walter Brennan, Ward Bond, Claude Akins.\n\n  Directed  by: Howard Hawks.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 2hr. 21min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 688 x 432","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b27e7676313ffbc8c3a6cb5f7c78997f815c29b4","amp;dn":"Rio+Bravo+%281959%29+%28John+Wayne%2C+Dean+Martin%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b27e7676313ffbc8c3a6cb5f7c78997f815c29b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,126,118,118,49,63,251,200,195,166,203,95,124,120,153,127,129,92,41,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
