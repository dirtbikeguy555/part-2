Certainly, writing the next Minecraft or programming complex simulations from scratch will require a deeper knowledge, but anyone and everyone has the potential to learn some basic coding skills, then take those skills and write a simple program. This book can help you and your kids take that potential further. Read it, follow the projects and get to grips with the fundamentals of programming, and you and they can learn to code. The projects in this book are fun, and they are also easy to customise, so that novice programmers can take what we have put together, change it and make their own mark","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3805c8f8606a0bc03a847a25ee502e4a2a8ca1f1","amp;dn":"Teach+Your+Kids+to+Code+-+2014++UK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3805c8f8606a0bc03a847a25ee502e4a2a8ca1f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,5,200,248,96,106,11,192,58,132,122,37,238,80,46,74,42,140,161,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
