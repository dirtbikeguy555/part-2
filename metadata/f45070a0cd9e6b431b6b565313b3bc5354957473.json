Whether you want to work with .NET for the web or desktop, or for Windows 8 on any device, Dan ClarkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s accessible, quick-paced guide will give you the foundation you need for a successful future in C# programming.\n\nIn this book you will:\n- Master the fundamentals of object-oriented programming\n- Work through a case study to see how C# and OOP work in a real-world application\n- Develop techniques and best practices that lead to efficient, reusable, elegant code\n- Discover how to transform a simple model of an application into a fully-functional C# project.\n\nWith more than 30 fully hands-on activities, Beginning C# Object-Oriented Programming teaches you how to design a user interface, implement your business logic, and integrate your application with a relational database for data storage. Along the way, you will explore the .NET Framework, ASP.NET and WinRT. In addition, you will develop desktop, mobile and web-based user interfaces, and service-oriented programming skills, all using MicrosoftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s industry-leading Visual Studio 2012, C#, the Entity Framework, and more. Read this book and let Dan Clark guide you in your journey to becoming a confident C# programmer.\n\nWhat youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn\n- Lay the foundations of great C# programming by understanding object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.\n- Understand how OOP can be applied across desktop, web and mobile worlds in Windows today.\n- Learn to use the Universal Modeling Language (UML) to quickly design an application correctly from the first attempt.\n- Discover the .NET Framework, ASP.NET and WinRT and how they can help you create applications quickly and efficiently.\n- Walk along as the author guides you through a final challenge, to develop a complete application using a wide range of the techniques and best practices covered inside.\n\nTable of Contents\nChapter 1.
