It is the story of an eerily compelling madman pursuing an unholy war against a creature as vast and dangerous and unknowable as the sea itself. But more than just a novel of adventure, more than an encyclopedia of whaling lore and legend, Moby-Dick is a haunting, mesmerizing, and important social commentary populated with several of the most unforgettable and enduring characters in literature. Written with wonderfully redemptive humor, Moby-Dick is a profound and timeless inquiry into character, faith, and the nature of perception.\n\nWhat more do we need to say about one of the greatest literary masterpieces of all time? Full Retail from Amazon. Chaptered, Covered, Calibre ready. ePub, and Mobi. I RARELY read classical literature (Anybody ever enjoy reading War and Peace or The Scarlet Letter?) but I have enjoyed this one.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c5aea085849d522f0f12fb8561a59ecf0150ffc","amp;dn":"Moby+Dick+by+Herman+Melville+%28ePub%2C+Mobi+Retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c5aea085849d522f0f12fb8561a59ecf0150ffc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,90,234,8,88,73,213,34,240,241,47,184,86,26,89,236,240,21,15,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
