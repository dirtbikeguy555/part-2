Where the thrust of Dylan's music remains its bleak introspection and bitter realism, Donovan fully embraced the wide-eyed optimism of the flower power movement, his ethereal, ornate songs radiating a mystical beauty and childlike wonder; for better or worse, his recordings remain quintessential artifacts of the psychedelic era, capturing the peace and love idealism of their time to perfection. Donovan Leitch was born May 10, 1946 in Glasgow and raised outside of London; at 18 he recorded his first demo, and in 1965 was tapped as a regular on the television pop showcase Ready, Steady, Go! He soon issued his debut single &quot;Catch the Wind,&quot; earning the first round of Dylan comparisons with his ramshackle folk sound and ragamuffin look; the single nevertheless reached the U.K. Top Five, with a subsequent meeting between the two singer/songwriters captured in the classic D.A. Pennebaker documentary Don't Look Back.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n\n01.Sunshine Superman\n02.Mellow Yellow (Single Version)\n03.Catch The Wind (Single Version)\n04.There Is A Mountain\n05.Isle Of Islay\n06.Wear Your Love Like Heaven\n07.Colours\n08.Young Girl Blues\n09.Epistle To Dippy\n10.Hurdy Gurdy Man\n11.Goo Goo Barabajagal (Love Is Hot)\n12.Happiness Runs\n13.Atlantis\n14.Season Of The Witch\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28bd415b678acf5751dd8d6871aeeb80d949bb5d","amp;dn":"Donovan+-+The+Very+Best+Of+Donovan+%282008%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28bd415b678acf5751dd8d6871aeeb80d949bb5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,189,65,91,103,138,207,87,81,221,141,104,113,174,235,128,217,73,187,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
