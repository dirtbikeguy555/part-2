This show comes from various countries: some shows will say &quot;Forensic Files,&quot; and others will say &quot;Medical Detectives&quot; on the title card (both are alternate titles for the same show: all say Forensic Files in the directory listing for filename consistency), and there are varying theme tunes for each show. This torrent comes from the following sources:\n\n1.) The CourtTV DVD Forensic Files DVD Release\n2.) The Official DVD 8-Pack, containing:\na. Convictions Overturned\nb. Crimes of Passion\nc. Death by Poison\nd. Historic Cases\ne. Kidnapping Cases\nf. Medical Mysteries\ng. Serial Killers\nh. Sex Crimes\n3.) The Forensic Files Collection A - L Torrent\n4.) The Forensic Files Collection M - Z Torrent\n5.) The Forensic Files Documentary Television Series Torrent\n6.) The Forensic Files Gigapacks 1, 2, and Repack\n7.) Medical Detectives The Collector's Edition Torrent\n\nThe torrent requires DivX video and AAC audio codecs. Most are TV quality, the ones published on DVD are mainly DVD quality, and the aspect ratio varies between standard width to widescreen. The collection comes in three parts, due to its massive 52GB size. Each piece is between 16-20GB, for easy seeding for those whom are limited in disk space. As of this writing Forensic Files seems to no longer be playing on TruTV, so let's keep this wonderful detective drama alive for years to come!\n\n--- ALSO ---\n\nDo you like oldies?
