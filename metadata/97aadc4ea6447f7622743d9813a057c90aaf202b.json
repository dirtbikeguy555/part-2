Now you can get that classic \n      FabFilter sound for a Micro price! With a single high-quality filter, \n      FabFilter Micro is the ultimate lightweight filter plug-in.    \n\n      Tiny yet powerful\n\n      FabFilter Micro's single filter is smooth and creamy, yet easily turns into \n      raw saturation and self-oscillation when tweaked using the interactive \n      filter display. It features low-pass and high-pass shapes and an envelope \n      follower to modulate the cut-off frequency.\n     \n      Saturation and distortion\n\n      With the individual Input Gain and Output Gain parameters, you can fully \n      control the saturation of the internal filter, making FabFilter Micro not \n      only ideally suited for basic filtering tasks, but also capable of beautiful \n      distortion and analog saturation effects.\n\n      FabFilter goodies\n\n      Of course, you also get all the usual FabFilter goodies: perfectly tuned \n      knobs, MIDI Learn, Smart Parameter Interpolation for smooth parameter \n      transitions, extensive help with interactive help hints, AltiVec and SSE \n      optimization, and much more!\n\n      Mac OS X requirements:\n      * 32-bit: OS X 10.4 or higher\n      * 64-bit: OS X 10.6\n      * Pro Tools, AU or VST 2/3 host\n      * G4/G5 or Intel processor\n\n###################  FabFilter.One.v3.12.AU.VSTi.RTAS.MAC.OSX.UB-DYNAMiCS             \n\n      SUPPLiER..: Team DYNAMiCS                     DiSKS...: 2 * 5MB\n      CRACKER...: Team DYNAMiCS                     DATE....: 0722 2010\n      PACKAGER..: Team DYNAMiCS                     RELEASE#: DYNAMiCS-651\n      PROTECTION: Serial                            FORMAT..: VSTi/AU/RTAS/OSX/UB\n\n                  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.fabfilter.com/products/one.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.fabfilter.com/products/one.php&lt;/a&gt; \n\n  For FabFilter One, we have put tremendous effort in creating the best \n      cut-off filter ever. Our new design approach has resulted in the fattest \n      and smoothest self-oscillating digital filter you have ever heard. It has \n      been tuned carefully to achieve the character and warmth of a classic \n      analog synthesizer. FabFilter OneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s filter sounds raw but never cheap or \n      ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“digitalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, even at full resonance.\n\n      The filter is fed by an equally high-quality solid-sounding oscillator, \n      developed from scratch to be completely aliasing-free. It features sawtooth, \n      triangle, and square wave forms with pulse width modulation.\n\n      The oscillator and the filter can be modulated by the LFO and the EG. The \n      LFO offers triangle and square wave forms, with adjustable wave balance \n      so any wave form between sawtooth and triangle can be selected. The tempo \n      can be synchronized to the host. The EG has the usual ADSR knobs, but with \n      a perfectly fine-tuned feel. Also, it has an additional Hold setting that \n      extends the time keys are held down.\n\n      \n      What FabFilter One excels at is the attention to detail and fine-tuning \n      that is visible throughout the plug-in. For example, the portamento \n      feature doesn't just slide from one note to another, but uses a carefully \n      selected algorithm to make your playing more lively and give it just that \n      little extra bit of magic.\n\n      Smart Parameter Interpolation handles changes to any of FabFilter One's \n      parameters, ensuring both responsiveness and smooth transitions. There \n      are no annoying digital clicks and zipper effects, and even MIDI controller \n      changes are handled perfectly smooth.\n\n      Naturally, the FabFilter One plug-in handles all parameter changes at sample \n      accuracy and it can be used with arbitrary sample rates. All parameters are \n      fully automatable within your favorite host and via MIDI Learn. The included \n      help file describes all features of FabFilter One in detail, together with \n      overviews and tutorials to create various types of sounds.\n\n\n      Mac OS X requirements:\n      * 32-bit: OS X 10.4 or higher\n      * 64-bit: OS X 10.6\n      * Pro Tools, AU or VST 2/3 host\n      * G4/G5 or Intel processor\n\n\n###################  FabFilter.Pro-C.v1.14.AU.VST.RTAS.MAC.OSX.UB-DYNAMiCS             \n\n      SUPPLiER..: Team DYNAMiCS                     DiSKS...: 2 * 5MB\n      CRACKER...: Team DYNAMiCS                     DATE....: 0722 2010\n      PACKAGER..: Team DYNAMiCS                     RELEASE#: DYNAMiCS-652\n      PROTECTION: Serial                            FORMAT..: VST/AU/RTAS/OSX/UB\n\n                 &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.fabfilter.com/products/pro-c.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.fabfilter.com/products/pro-c.php&lt;/a&gt;      \n\n      Incredible sound and character\n\n      FabFilter Pro-C is a high quality compressor plug-in with various beautiful \n      program dependent compression styles.

The filters can be used in serial or parallel mode.\n\n      Originally developed for FabFilter One, Simplon's filters were designed \n      from the ground up to be the fattest and smoothest self-oscillating digital \n      filters possible.

They range from smooth filters \n      with moderate overdrive to raw, self-oscillating over-the-top madness!\n\n      In combination with the response and slope settings, FabFilter Simplon \n      offers up to 27 different filter types.\n\n      Tweak the filters with Simplon's large interactive filter display that \n      shows both filter curves and lets you drag them around. You can adjust \n      the filters separately or both at the same time.\n\n      And of course, you get all the usual FabFilter goodies: perfectly fine-tuned \n      knobs that work both in vertical and circular drag modes, interactive MIDI \n      Learn, Smart Parameter Interpolation for smooth parameter transitions, great \n      presets, extensive help file with interactive help hints, sample accurate \n      automation for all parameters, AltiVec and SSE optimization, and much more.\n\n      Mac OS X requirements:\n      * 32-bit: OS X 10.4 or higher\n      * 64-bit: OS X 10.6\n      * Pro Tools, AU or VST 2/3 host\n      * G4/G5 or Intel processor\n\n\n###################  Synium CleanApp v3.4 *INCL.KEYMAKER*                  \n                                                                       \n                                                                         \n    Cracked by....:  symmetry          Release-Name..:  CR-1JO01.ZIP     \n    Supplied......:  CORE              Release-Date..:  2010/07/24       \n    Packaged......:  CORE              Release-Type..:  Util             \n    Protection....:  Serial            OS............:  MacOSX          \n    Crack/SN......:  Keymaker          Language......:  English         \n    Rating........:  [You decide!]     Disks.........:  06              \n\n                        ..: DESCRiPTiON :..                            \n                                                                           \n                                                                           \n    Have you ever unsuccessfully tried to get rid of a program and all     \n    the files that came with it?
