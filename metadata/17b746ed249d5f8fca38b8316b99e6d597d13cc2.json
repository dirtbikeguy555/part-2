Corgan is the group's primary songwriterÃ¢â‚¬â€his grand musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's albums and songs, which have been described as &quot;anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land&quot;.[3]\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, 1993's Siamese Dream. The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up, the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. With 19.75 million albums sold in the United States,[4][5] The Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up.\n\nIn 2006, Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, Zeitgeist. The band toured with a rotating lineup of between five and nine musicians through much of 2007 and 2008 with new member Jeff Schroeder before Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. New drummer Mike Byrne and bassist Nicole Fiorentino solidified a new lineup with Corgan and Schroeder, toured through much of 2010 and 2011, and are currently recording the album Teargarden by Kaleidyscope, having just released the album-within-an-album Oceania. \n\n\n\nEnjoy The Smashing Pumpkins :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17b746ed249d5f8fca38b8316b99e6d597d13cc2","amp;dn":"Smashing+Pumpkins+-+Discography+1991+-+2012+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17b746ed249d5f8fca38b8316b99e6d597d13cc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,183,70,237,36,157,95,143,202,56,184,49,107,153,230,213,151,209,60,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
