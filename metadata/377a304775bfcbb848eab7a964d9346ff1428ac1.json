It is currently developed and published by YoYo Games, a software company in which Overmars is involved. GameMaker allows users to create video games without any prior knowledge of programming languages. GameMaker allows users to create games much faster, so it is sometimes used as prototyping engine.\nThe latest stable Windows release is GameMaker:Studio As of May 2012 and version 7 on Mac OS X as of 11 August 2010. Game Maker Studio was released on the 22nd May 2012,[1] with the latest GameMaker Standard release being GameMaker 8.1. Since its initial release in 1999, GameMaker gained many new features, notably 3D graphics support, cross-platform support, as well as a significant user base, with YoYo Games providing free hosting for user-created games.\nYoYo Games has just[when?] undertaken a serious overhaul of the GameMaker software in the form GameMaker Studio. GameMaker Studio allows development for platforms including iOS, Android, Windows, Macintosh, and HTML5, and more platform options are planned.[2] The main difference between GameMaker Studio and the other GameMaker releases (GameMaker Standard and GameMaker Mac) is the fact that it is possible to export to other platforms. There are also other changes, including the look of the default skin (and the option to change the skin), as well as the removal of some statements in the GameMaker language for ensured compatibility.\nGame Maker has a number of programs that can collaborate with its programming including ENIGMA (Game Maker) the free Linux/iOS/Windows compatible augmentation of Game Maker, and Ultimate 3D which is extensive graphics rendering API for overriding Game Maker's default graphics capabilities.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:377a304775bfcbb848eab7a964d9346ff1428ac1","amp;dn":"Game+Maker+Pro+8.0+%281-click+run%29%28registred%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"377a304775bfcbb848eab7a964d9346ff1428ac1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,122,48,71,117,191,203,184,72,234,183,169,100,217,52,111,241,66,138,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
