Released on September 24, 1990, it was the third Megadeth album distributed through Capitol Records. The album was the band's only collaboration with record producer Mike Clink who was the first producer to successfully produce a Megadeth album from start to finish, without being fired. It was the first album to feature guitarist Marty Friedman and drummer Nick Menza, following the firing of both Jeff Young and Chuck Behler in 1989. It entered the Billboard 200 at number 23, and was eventually certified platinum by the RIAA in 1994.[1]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4ec5ba819915beceab4ee3741b9a62521ff99ef","amp;dn":"Megadeth+-+Rust+In+Peace+%28Remastered%29+320KBPS+MP3+NIPPER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4ec5ba819915beceab4ee3741b9a62521ff99ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,236,91,168,25,145,91,236,234,180,238,55,65,185,166,37,33,255,153,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
