Vegas's oldest and most violent crime family is now preparing for vengeance, and the entire Maddox family is a target.\r\n\r\nThe secret Thomas and Travis have kept for a decade will be revealed to the rest of the family, and for the first time the Maddoxes will be at odds. While none of them are strangers to loss, the family has grown, and the risk is higher than ever. With brothers against brothers and wives taking sides, each member will make a choiceâ€”let the fear tear them apart, or make them stronger.\r\n\r\n=======================================\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/shtihl22\r\n\r\n=======================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0576ae7fba385b8bcaf0fa393d5f2db1a7df98f","amp;dn":"A+Beautiful+Funeral+%28The+Maddox+Brothers+5%29+by+Jamie+McGuire+%2820","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0576ae7fba385b8bcaf0fa393d5f2db1a7df98f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,87,106,231,251,163,133,184,188,175,15,163,147,213,242,219,26,125,249,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
