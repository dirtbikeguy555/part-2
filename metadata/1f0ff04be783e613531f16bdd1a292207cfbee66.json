It builds on the success of the Norton Ghost 12.0 and includes features that allow you to back up both specific files and folders with ease as well as your entire hard drive. With this feature you can safeguard your documents, photos, music files and financial records for potential loss.\n\nKey Technologies\n  -Creates full system and file backups\n  -Restores from system failures\n  -Saves recovery points to offsite locations\n  -Symantec ThreatCon integration\n\nFeatures\n  -Full system backup (disk image). Backs up everything on a hard drive or\n   partition.\n  -File and folder backup. Backs up only the specific files and folders you choose   \n   rather than saving an entire drive.\n  -FTP backup. Copies recovery points to a FTP site for easier offsite backup  \n   management.\n  -Offsite backup backs up your files to NAS (Network-Attached Storage) devices.\n  -Symantec ThreatCon integration triggers incremental backups whenever ThreatCon \n   reaches a specified threat level. Great for computers without virus protection.\n  -Incremental and differential backup. Backs up only files that have changed.\n  -Google Desktop integration. Makes data recovery even faster with searchable \n   backup indexes.\n   LightsOut Restore.

Minimizes storage space and helps keep \n   sensitive documents safe.\n\nVirus reports of infostealer.gampass are FALSE POSITIVES so you have no need to worry... Just install Norton Ghost, then the service pack and then register that's it.  \nI included a serial just incase you don't want to use the keygen ;)\n\n\nSeed, enjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f0ff04be783e613531f16bdd1a292207cfbee66","amp;dn":"Norton+Ghost+V14.0+%2B+SP2+-+EDGE+Keygen+%2B+Serial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f0ff04be783e613531f16bdd1a292207cfbee66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,15,240,75,231,131,230,19,83,31,22,189,209,162,146,32,124,251,238,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
