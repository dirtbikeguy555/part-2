(assuming there are girls downloading my shit)\nIf you are suprised by the sudden disparition (or not) of the following torrent,\nThen I must explain you why:\n\nI should stop smoking fun herbs all the time while I'm uploading on the pirate bay. (especially when compressing a file with a beta version of WinRar, in a format that is unsupported by many archivers.)\nThat said, the setup package was corrupted and ... well completely fucked up.\nI am sorry for the trouble it may have caused to you, thus I reupload it with no compression this time.\nThanks for supporting my torrents (by seeding). I love you &lt;3\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDescription :\n\n\n Ãƒâ€ºÃ‚Â²Ã‚Â±                         &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.waves.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.waves.com/&lt;/a&gt;                         Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â²Ãƒâ€º \n Ãƒâ€ºÃ‚Â²Ã‚Â±                                                                        Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â²Ãƒâ€º \n Ãƒâ€ºÃ‚Â²Ã‚Â±    Featuring 64-bit support, faster scanning, faster loading, and      Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â²Ãƒâ€º \n Ãƒâ€ºÃ‚Â²Ã‚Â±  faster processing, Waves Version 9 opens up new dimensions of high    Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â²Ãƒâ€º \n Ãƒâ€ºÃ‚Â²Ã‚Â±  performance plugin power.
