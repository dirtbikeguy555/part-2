That idea didn't last long, however, and the band ultimately expanded, with friends coming and going until the lineup settled down a year later with the addition of Kurt Walcher (drums) and Matt Ebert (bass, vocals). Joyce Manor released a split 7&quot; with fellow Californians Summer Vacation in the fall of 2010 via Muy Autentico Records; that same year the five-song Constant Headache demo surfaced as well. It was easy to hear the influence of Jawbreaker in Joyce Manor's music, and the group claimed other influences like early Weezer and Guided by Voices. Songs rarely went past the two-minute mark and their raw yet accessible nature helped to build their name among punk fans. 6131 Records soon took notice thanks to the band's friends in TouchÃƒÂ© AmorÃƒÂ©, who passed their music along to the label. It then only took seeing the group live to get them totally hooked, and in the summer of 2010, Joyce Manor -- representing a departure for the primarily hardcore label -- became an official part of the 6131 family. Their self-titled, full-length debut was released in 2011 to a host of critical and fan praise, and it landed the band on many year-end best-of lists. A split with Oakland's Big Kids followed, as did a bunch of nationwide touring. Joyce Manor moved over to Asian Man Records for their next album; Of All Things I Will Soon Grow Tired appeared in April 2012, boasting an efficient nine songs in just over 13 minutes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b608f525f71b169d7d88f51d58d3dc8b9e49869c","amp;dn":"Joyce+Manor+-+Discography+%282010-2012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b608f525f71b169d7d88f51d58d3dc8b9e49869c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,8,245,37,247,27,22,157,125,136,245,29,88,211,220,139,158,73,134,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
