No matter how cohesive their records were (or not), their albums always played like collections of singles and since singles are easy to anthologize, it stands to reason that the best of the Ramones' songs will sound good in nearly any context; hell, the haphazard Ramones Mania proved that. However, Rhino's double-disc Hey! Ho! Let's Go: Ramones Anthology has much greater goals than being just another collection -- it strives to be the final word on the Ramones. Weighing in at nearly 60 songs, with a hardcover book that includes an excellent history by David Fricke, it has to be said that the set has the heft of history, which is both a blessing and a curse. It's a blessing because Anthology does its job perfectly -- apart from &quot;We're a Happy Family,&quot; no major songs are missing and it tells its history succinctly, even at its length. The problem is that the Ramones did drop in quality sometime after End of the Century. They never bottomed out, but their music became less exciting, which is evident in this anthology, as the second disc is simply not as compelling as the first. That's not to say it isn't good -- with &quot;The KKK Took My Baby Away&quot; and &quot;My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes to Bitburg),&quot; it can be great -- but it isn't timeless like the entire first disc is. Yet, this is nitpicking, since Anthology does a flawless job in summarizing the band's career. True, most listeners will wear out the first disc while rarely reaching for the second, but this is still essential.\nAll Music Review by Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Blitzkrieg Bop\n[02] Beat On The Brat\n[03] Judy Is A Punk\n[04] I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\n[05] 53rd &amp; 3rd\n[06] Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue\n[07] Glad To See You Go\n[08] Gimme Gimme Shock Treatment\n[09] I Remember You\n[10] California Sun\n[11] Commando\n[12] Swallow My Pride\n[13] Carbona Not Glue\n[14] Pinhead\n[15] Sheena Is A Punk Rocker [Original ABC Single Version]\n[16] Cretin Hop\n[17] Rockaway Beach\n[18] Here Today, Gone Tomorrow\n[19] Teenage Lobotomy\n[20] Surfin' Bird\n[21] I Don't Care\n[22] I Just Want To Have Something To Do\n[23] I Wanna Be Sedated\n[24] Don't Come Close\n[25] She's The One\n[26] Needles &amp; Pins\n[27] Rock 'n' Roll High School\n[28] I Want You Around\n[29] Do You Remember Rock 'n' Roll Radio\n[30] I Can't Make It On Time\n[31] Chinese Rock\n[32] I'm Affected\n[33] Danny Says\n\nPlay Time - 01h:18m:41s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] The KKK Took My Baby Away\n[02] She Is A Sensation\n[03] It Is Not My Place (In The 9 To 5 World)\n[04] We Want The Airwaves\n[05] Psycho Therapy\n[06] Howling At The Moon (Sha-La-La)\n[07] Mamas Boy\n[08] Daytime Dilemma (Dangers Of Love)\n[09] I Am Not Afraid Of Life\n[10] Too Tough To Die\n[11] Endless Vacation\n[12] My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down (Bonzo Goes To Bitburg)\n[13] Somebody Put Something In My Drink\n[14] Something To Believe In\n[15] I Do Not Want To Live This Life (Anymore)\n[16] I Wanna Live\n[17] Garden Of Serenity\n[18] Merry Christmas (I Do Not Want To Fight Tonight)\n[19] Pet Sematary\n[20] I Believe In Miracles\n[21] Tomorrow She Goes Away\n[22] Poison Heart\n[23] I Do Not Wanna Grow Up\n[24] She Talks To Rainbows\n[25] R.A.M.O.N.E.S.\n\nPlay Time - 01h:17m:07s\n\nTotal Music Play Time.......... 02h:35m:48s\nTotal File Size....................... 373mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
