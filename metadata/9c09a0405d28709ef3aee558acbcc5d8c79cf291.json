Though that which doesn't kill us can make us stronger, as Nietzsche tells us, few authors today offer any insight into just how to springboard from adversity to strength.\n\nIt doesn't just happen automatically, and it takes practice. New scientific research suggests that resilience isn't something with which only a fortunate few of us have been born, but rather something we can all take specific action to develop. To build strength out of adversity, we need a catalyst. What we need, according to Dr. Alex Lickerman, is wisdomÃ¢â‚¬â€wisdom that adversity has the potential to teach us.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c09a0405d28709ef3aee558acbcc5d8c79cf291","amp;dn":"The+Undefeated+Mind%3A++Science+of+Constructing+an+Indestructible","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c09a0405d28709ef3aee558acbcc5d8c79cf291","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,9,160,64,93,40,112,158,243,174,229,88,172,188,197,216,199,156,242,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
