The 14-year-old auditioned for LaFace co-founder L.A. Reid, who signed the gospel choir boy to a recording contract. Raymond was introduced to the world simply as &quot;Usher,&quot; and released his debut album of the same name in 1994, which featured co-executive producer Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs. The first single, &quot;Think of You,&quot; gained Usher wide recognition and reached gold status. From that initial exposure, Usher was approached to do other projects. In 1995, he recorded a national holiday jingle for Coca-Cola. He also joined several top male R&amp;B vocalists to form Black Men United for the single &quot;You Will Know,&quot; featured on the Jason's Lyric soundtrack. He also teamed with teen singing sensation Monica for a duet remake of Latimore's &quot;Let's Straighten It Out.&quot; \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Can U Get Wit It\n02.Love Was Here\n03.Nice &amp; Slow\n04.Think Of You\n05.I Will\n06.You Make Me Wanna...\n07.Pop Ya Collar\n08.U Got It Bad\n09.U Don't Have A Call\n10.U Remind Me\n11.Yeah!\n12.Burn\n13.Confessions\n14.Confessions Part 2\n15.Superstar (Luther Vandross Version)\n16.Superstar\n17.Bad Girl\n18.That's What It's Made For\n19.Can U Handle It\n20.Caught Up\n21.My Way\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.This Ain't Sex\n02.Moving Mountains\n03.Throwback\n04.Trading Places\n05.Love You Gently\n06.Appetite\n07.What's A Man To Do\n08.Lifetime\n09.His Mistakes\n10.There Goes My Baby\n11.Mars Vs.
