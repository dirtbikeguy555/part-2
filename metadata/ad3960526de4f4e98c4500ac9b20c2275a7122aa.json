He served as a war correspondent during World War II, and was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962 &quot;for his realistic and imaginative writings, combining as they do sympathetic humour and keen social perception&quot;.  In 1964, Steinbeck was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Lyndon B. Johnson.\n\nTHE GRAPES OF WRATH (1939) is widely considered Steinbeck's finest and most ambitious novel.  Telling the story of a dispossessed Oklahoma family and their struggle to carve out a new life in California at the height of the Great Depression, the book captured the mood and angst of the nation during this time period.  At the height of its popularity, the novel sold 10,000 copies per week and eventually earned Steinbeck a Pulitzer Prize in 1940.\n\n\nAll the following books are in ePUB format:\n\n* THE ACTS OF KING ARTHUR AND HIS NOBLE KNIGHTS (Penguin, 2007).
