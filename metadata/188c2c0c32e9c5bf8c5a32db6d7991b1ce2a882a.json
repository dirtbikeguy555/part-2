The variety of tools and algorithms under the PGM framework extend to many domains such as natural language processing, speech processing, image processing, and disease diagnosis.\n\nYou've probably heard of graphical models before, and you're keen to try out new landscapes in the machine learning area. This book gives you enough background information to get started on graphical models, while keeping the math to a minimum.\n\nWhat you will learn from this book\n\nCreate Bayesian networks and make inferences\nLearn the structure of causal Bayesian networks from data\nGain an insight on algorithms that run inference\nExplore parameter estimation in Bayes nets with PyMC sampling\nUnderstand the complexity of running inference algorithms in Bayes networks\nDiscover why graphical models can trump powerful classifiers in certain problems\nApproach\n\nThis is a short, practical guide that allows data scientists to understand the concepts of Graphical models and enables them to try them out using small Python code snippets, without being too mathematically complicated.\n\nWho this book is written for\n\nIf you are a data scientist who knows about machine learning and want to enhance your knowledge of graphical models, such as Bayes network, in order to use them to solve real-world problems using Python libraries, this book is for you. This book is intended for those who have some Python and machine learning experience, or are exploring the machine learning field","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:188c2c0c32e9c5bf8c5a32db6d7991b1ce2a882a","amp;dn":"Building+Probabilistic+Graphical+Models+with+Python+%5BMyeBookShel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"188c2c0c32e9c5bf8c5a32db6d7991b1ce2a882a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,140,44,12,50,233,197,191,140,90,50,219,109,121,145,177,206,42,136,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
