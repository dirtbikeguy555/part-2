Each level is randomly generated so each playthrough has a unique environment and challenges. The player's goal is to search and activate all the marks placed in each level to unlock the dungeon and hopefully escape. However, players will encounter different obstacles in the labyrinthine dungeons. Players can collect various items and upgrades to counter the dungeon's dark forces.\n\nSome elements in Dungeon Souls were inspired by Risk of Rain, Nuclear Throne, Overture, BitVenture and Shoot First","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ff47ce9e71cee18d6dd0b8317c314c95969548f","amp;dn":"Dungeon+Souls+-+Beta+v2.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ff47ce9e71cee18d6dd0b8317c314c95969548f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,244,124,233,231,28,238,24,214,221,11,131,23,195,20,201,89,105,84,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
