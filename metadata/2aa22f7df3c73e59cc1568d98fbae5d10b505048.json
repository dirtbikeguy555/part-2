The film \n\nconcentrates on a young, barely literate shepherd boy, who lives under the thumb of his tyrannical peasant father. \n\nRescued from his family--and his isolated lifestyle--when called for military service, the boy eventually emerges as a \n\nbrilliant scholar. Filmmakers Paolo Taviani and Vittorio Taviani have always displayed an uncanny knack for perfectly \n\ncapturing the manners, mores and thought processes of Southern Italy&amp;#039;s working poor. Though the protagonist&amp;#039;s father is \n\nclearly the villain of the piece, the Tavianis endeavor to understand and explain his point-of-view and the traditional values \n\nthat have compelled him to treat his son so harshly. Filmed in a stark, straightforward fashion Padre Padrone went on to \n\nbecome the first film ever to win both the Golden Palm and the International Critics&amp;#039; Prize at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Padre padrone.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 53mn\n      Bit rate : 1719 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 13.7 MiB\n      Writing library : VirtualDub build 0/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Simple Profile/Level 3\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Custom\n      PlayTime : 1h 53mn\n      Bit rate : 1577 Kbps\n      Width : 672 pixels\n      Height : 416 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 1.615\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.234\n      StreamSize : 1.25 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 1h 53mn\n      Bit rate : 133 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 108 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.97b\n      Encoding settings : ABR\n\nIMDB: tt0076517\n\nItalian audio, English, Spanish, Portuguese (Brazil) subtitles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2aa22f7df3c73e59cc1568d98fbae5d10b505048","amp;dn":"Padre+Padrone+-+Father+and+Master+-+Taviani+%281977%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2aa22f7df3c73e59cc1568d98fbae5d10b505048","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,162,47,125,243,199,62,89,204,21,104,217,143,186,229,209,11,80,80,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
