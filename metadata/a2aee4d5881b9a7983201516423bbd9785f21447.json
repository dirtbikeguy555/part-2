From framing layout all the way through to detail drawing production, SAFE integrates every aspect of the engineering design process in one easy and intuitive environment. SAFE provides unmatched benefits to the engineer with its truly unique combination of power, comprehensive capabilities, and ease-of-use.\r\n\r\nLaying out models is quick and efficient with the sophisticated drawing tools, or use one of the import options to bring in data from CAD, spreadsheet, or database programs. Slabs or foundations can be of any shape, and can include edges shaped with circular and spline curves.\r\n\r\nPost-tensioning may be included in both slabs and beams to balance a percentage of the self-weight. Suspended slabs can include flat, two-way, waffle, and ribbed framing systems. Models can have columns, braces, walls, and ramps connected from the floors above and below. Walls can be modeled as either straight or curved.\r\n\r\nMats and foundations can include nonlinear uplift from the soil springs, and a nonlinear cracked analysis is available for slabs. Generating pattern surface loads is easily done by SAFE with an automated option. Design strips can be generated by SAFE or drawn in a completely arbitrary manner by the user, with complete control provided for locating and sizing the calculated reinforcement. Finite element design without strips is also available and useful for slabs with complex geometries.\r\n\r\nComprehensive and customizable reports are available for all analysis and design results. Detailed plans, sections, elevations, schedules, and tables may be generated, viewed, and printed from within SAFE or exported to CAD packages.\r\n\r\nSAFE provides an immensely capable yet easy-to-use program for structural designers, provideing the only tool necessary for the modeling, analysis, design, and detailing of concrete slab systems and foundations.\r\n\r\nSAFE 2014 14.1.0 | 14.1.1 | 14.2.0 Enhancements\r\n\r\nDesign\r\n\r\nReinforced and Prestressed concrete design have been added for the ACI 318-14 and CSA A23.3-14 codes.\r\nThe punching shear check of corner columns for all codes that consider linear elastic shear distribution along the punching perimeter now excludes the effect of the cross moment of inertia, making the check more practical and less over-conservative. This affects the ACI, Canadian, Chinese and Indian codes.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\nThe speed of nonlinear analysis has been increased.\r\n\r\nCSI SAFE Version 14.2.0 with License Generator by LAVteam (Thanks!)\r\n\r\n1. Disconnect from the Internet\r\n2. Run Setup (32bit only release from CSI)\r\n3. Run the safe_v142_kg and in the keygen folder it will be generated a lservrc license file (~3KB)\r\n4. Copy the license file to :\r\na. C:Program Files (x86)Computers and StructuresSAFE 2014CSiLicensing and also in C:Program Files (x86)Computers and StructuresSAFE 2014\r\nb. For another user-chosen folder, find the directory and copy the license file there. \r\n5. Make sure SAFE.exe is blocked at the Firewall from connecting to the Internet\r\nThe How-to-crack above works. If the error &quot;...license file missing etc etc&quot; repeat the step above\r\nLicense is valid for 355 days starting from 14/07/2016 (ends somewhere in July 2017). If you want this time not to end :\r\n1. Change time at your windows clock and put it some years before 2016\r\n2. Wait for the next CSI Bridge update (Version 15 or 14.x.x) coming in the middle of year 2017 (or earlier 2016) or another crack.\r\nUntil then support by keeping this torrent alive by seeding it or adding it to a seedbox, trust me it's worth the share!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2aee4d5881b9a7983201516423bbd9785f21447","amp;dn":"CSI+SAFE+Version+14.2.0+Build+1069+%2B+Crack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2aee4d5881b9a7983201516423bbd9785f21447","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,174,228,213,136,27,154,121,131,32,21,22,66,59,189,151,133,242,20,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
