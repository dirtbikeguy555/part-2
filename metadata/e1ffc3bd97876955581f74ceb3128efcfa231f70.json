The first game console to use this format was \nthe Fairchild Channel F; however, the Atari 2600 receives credit for making the \nplug-in concept popular among the game-playing public.\n\nThe console was originally sold as the Atari VCS, for Video Computer System. \nFollowing the release of the Atari 5200, in 1982, the VCS was renamed \\\\\\&quot;Atari \n2600\\\\\\&quot;, after the unit\\\\\\'s Atari part number, CX2600. The 2600 was typically \nbundled with two joystick controllers, a conjoined pair of paddle controllers, \nand a cartridge gameÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½initially Combat and later Pac-Man.\n\nThe Atari 2600 was wildly successful, and during much of the 1980s, \\\\\\&quot;Atari\\\\\\&quot; was \na synonym for this model in mainstream media and, by extension, for video games \nin general.\n\nThe Atari 2600 was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame at The Strong in \nRochester, NY in 2007. In 2009, the Atari 2600 was named the second greatest \nvideo game console of all time by IGN.\n Stella is an emulator for the Atari 2600 game console, and takes its name from \nthe console\\\\\\'s codename.[1] It is open source, and runs on most major modern \nplatforms including Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Windows CE/Mobile, Dreamcast, \nGP2X, Nintendo DS, and Wii. Stella was originally written in 1996 by Bradford W. \nMott (originally known as Stella ), and is now maintained by Stephen Anthony.\n\nStella is written in the C++ programming language and thus is highly portable.\n[3] The emulator supports all Atari 2600 cartridge bank switching schemes and \nhas support for nearly all Atari 2600 titles. Support is included for NTSC, PAL \nand SECAM in 60Hz/50Hz varieties, including autodetection of those formats \n(based on the number of scanlines generated in each frame).\n\nStella emulates most Atari 2600 peripheral devices, including standard \njoysticks, paddle controllers, the Atari Video Touch Pad, the Atari Keyboard \nController, Atari Indy 500 Driving Controllers, the CBS Booster-Grip controller, \nthe CX-22/CX-80/AmigaMouse trackball controllers, the Sega Genesis controller, \nand the AtariVox and SaveKey controllers. Stelladaptor and 2600-daptor support \nallows real joysticks, paddles, and driving controllers to be used, and support \nis also included to access a real AtariVox device plugged into a serial port \n(and actually generate sound from the AtariVox device). Stella does not yet \nsupport the Spectravideo Compumate or cassette-based titles designed to work \nwith the Coleco KidVid cassette player but does have support for titles designed \nto work with the Starpath Supercharger.\n\nStella includes many facilities for homebrew developers, including an extensive \nbuilt-in interactive debugger and disassembler supporting breakpoints, \nread/write traps, etc. Other major features include a cheatcode system, support \nfor user-defined palette files, state loading/saving, OpenGL rendering and \neffects, event remapping, and an extensive built-in, cross-platform user \ninterface (including a ROM launcher frontend).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1ffc3bd97876955581f74ceb3128efcfa231f70","amp;dn":"Atari+2600+Emulator+with+772+Roms+%5BDEATH-RG-%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1ffc3bd97876955581f74ceb3128efcfa231f70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,255,195,189,151,135,105,85,88,31,116,206,179,18,142,252,250,35,31,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
