It follows up the band's hugely successful 2009 Mercury Prize-nominated release Only Revolutions. Originally planned as two separate albums, Opposites is now set to be released as a double album featuring at least 20 cuts. In August, the band posted the song &quot;Stingin' Belle&quot; online as a preview of what to expect from the album. The band also revealed that Band of Horses lead singer Ben Bridwell will also guest on two tracks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bba24bfb1e9535bd17572b28c107e58019c40ce","amp;dn":"Biffy+Clyro+-+Opposites+%28Deluxe%29+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bba24bfb1e9535bd17572b28c107e58019c40ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,186,36,191,177,233,83,91,209,117,114,178,140,16,126,88,1,156,64,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
