When you move around it seems like the creature follows your movement\nand turns its head, looking at you.\n\nHow does it work? If we move around when viewing a solid object, our brain knows how\nthe object we are looking at should behave. However the dragon gives us the wrong\nclues, because we mis-interpret what its shape is. We assume that the nose of the\ndragon is pointing out towards us, but in fact the dragon's head is concave.\nThis is called a Hollow-Face illusion.\n\nNow you can build one yourself! Print it with your printer on regular paper, for\nexample standard A4, or use thicker paper. Then cut it out, fold and stick using\nglue. That is all!\n\nTips:\n- Many of the illusions are assembled in a similar manner, so if the illusion you\n  want to build doesn't have understandable instructions, see another one for help.\n\n- For OPTIMAL effect, COVER OR CLOSE 1 EYE, to shut off your brain's access to true\n  depth perception, forcing it to interpret on shape and light only. Two eyes may\n  work. One is better.\n\n- Bright but diffuse lighting. Lighting which is too harsh can create shadows which\n  break the illusion.\n\n- On the dragon's head and mouth, tape/glue the tabs as shown, but DON'T sharply\n  fold the paper where unnecessary. Seeing creases doesn't help.\n\n- Use thicker paper than the cheapest printer muck, but not too stiff. It's too easy\n  to get in situations where light comes through from the rear.\n\n- When cutting along the edge behind which the tabs will be attached, CUT OFF THE\n  BLACK OUTLINE so that the colors blend unbroken.\n\n- If you look at it for the first time ever, it might take a minute or so before you\n  see the effect.\n\nEnjoy!  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.urdjuret.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.urdjuret.com&lt;/a&gt;  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7f62723882b800cf1bb9f4cd96e86651a227943","amp;dn":"3D+Paper+Optical+Illusions+from+www.urdjuret.com+2014-06-18","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7f62723882b800cf1bb9f4cd96e86651a227943","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,246,39,35,136,43,128,12,241,187,159,76,217,110,134,101,26,34,121,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
