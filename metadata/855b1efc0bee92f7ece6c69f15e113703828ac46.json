Amid this tension, Jean, a young writer adrift, met and fell for Dannie, an enigmatic woman fleeing a troubled past. A half century later, with his old black notebook as a guide, he retraces this fateful period in his life, recounting how, through Dannie, he became mixed up with a group of unsavory characters connected by a shadowy crime. Soon Jean, too, was a person of interest to the detective pursuing their caseâ€“a detective who would prove instrumental in revealing Dannieâ€™s darkest secret.\r\nThe Black Notebook bears all the hallmarks of this Nobel Prizeâ€“winning literary masterâ€™s unsettling and intensely atmospheric style, rendered in English by acclaimed translator Mark Polizzotti (Suspended Sentences). Once again, Modiano invites us into his unique world, a Paris infused with melancholy, uncertain danger, and the fading echoes of lost love.\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:855b1efc0bee92f7ece6c69f15e113703828ac46","amp;dn":"The+Black+Notebook+-+Patrick+Modiano+%5BEN+EPUB%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"855b1efc0bee92f7ece6c69f15e113703828ac46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,91,30,252,11,238,146,247,236,230,198,159,21,225,19,112,56,40,172,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
