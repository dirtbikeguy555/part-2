He wrote The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and its sequel, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885), the latter often called &quot;the Great American Novel.&quot;\n\nTwain grew up in Hannibal, Missouri, which provided the setting for Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer. After an apprenticeship with a printer, he worked as a typesetter and contributed articles to the newspaper of his older brother Orion Clemens. He later became a riverboat pilot on the Mississippi River before heading west to join Orion in Nevada. He referred humorously to his singular lack of success at mining, turning to journalism for the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise.In 1865, his humorous story, &quot;The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,&quot; was published, based on a story he heard at Angels Hotel in Angels Camp, California, where he had spent some time as a miner. The short story brought international attention, and was even translated into classic Greek. His wit and satire, in prose and in speech, earned praise from critics and peers, and he was a friend to presidents, artists, industrialists, and European royalty.\n\nThe entire Mark Twain anthology with over 300 books and story collections.\n\nCONTENTS \nTHE INNOCENTS ABROAD\nMARK TWAIN'S (BURLESQUE) AUTO-BIOGRAPHY\nFIRST ROMANCE.\nROUGHING IT\nTHE GILDED AGE (with Charles Dudley Warner)\nSKETCHES NEW AND OLD\nTHE CURIOUS REPUBLIC OF GONDOUR AND OTHER WHIMSICAL SKETCHES\n1601--CONVERSATION AT THE SOCIAL FIRESIDE OF THE TUDORS\nTHE FACTS CONCERNING THE RECENT CARNIVAL OF CRIME IN CONNECTICUT\nTHE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER\nTHE LOVES OF ALONZO FITZ CLARENCE AND ROSANNAH ETHELTON AND OTHER STORIES\nSOME RAMBLING NOTES OF AN IDLE EXCURSION\nTHE STOLEN WHITE ELEPHANT\nA TRAMP ABROAD\nTHE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER\nLIFE ON THE MISSISSIPPI\nTHE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN\nA CONNECTICUT YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT\nTHE AMERICAN CLAIMANT\nEXTRACTS FROM ADAM'S DIARY\nIN DEFENSE OF HARRIET SHELLEY\nFENNIMORE COOPER'S LITERARY OFFENCES\nESSAYS ON PAUL BOURGET\nTOM SAWYER ABROAD\nTHE TRAGEDY OF PUDD'NHEAD WILSON\nTHOSE EXTRAORDINARY TWINS\nPERSONAL RECOLLECTIONS OF JOAN OF ARC\nTOM SAWYER, DETECTIVE\nFOLLOWING THE EQUATOR, A JOURNEY AROUND THE WORLD\nTHE MAN THAT CORRUPTED HADLEYBURG AND OTHER STORIES\nWHAT IS MAN AND OTHER ESSAYS\nIS SHAKESPEARE DEAD?\nTHE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER AND OTHER STORIES\nA DOUBLE BARRELED DETECTIVE\nTHE $30,000 BEQUEST AND OTHER STORIES\nTHE $30,000 BEQUEST\nA DOG'S TALE\nA BURLESQUE BIOGRAPHY\nHOW TO TELL A STORY\nEXTRACTS FROM ADAM'S DIARY\nEVE'S DIARY\nA HORSE'S TALE\nCHRISTIAN SCIENCE\nEXTRACT FROM CAPTAIN STORMFIELD'S VISIT TO HEAVEN\nGOLDSMITH'S FRIEND ABROAD AGAIN\nHOW TO TELL A STORY\nTHE WOUNDED SOLDIER\nTHE GOLDEN ARM\nMENTAL TELEGRAPHY AGAIN\nTHE INVALIDS STORY\nMARK TWAIN'S SPEECHES\nMARK TWAIN'S LETTERS 1853-1910","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f93f7a0ef574e0959538f047435c97120ff036f","amp;dn":"The+Complete+Mark+Twain+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f93f7a0ef574e0959538f047435c97120ff036f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,147,247,160,239,87,78,9,89,83,143,4,116,53,201,113,32,255,3,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
