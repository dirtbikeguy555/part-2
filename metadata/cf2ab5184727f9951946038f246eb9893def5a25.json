Training in ascending levels of difficulty - you start with an introductory training and then will move on to the more advanced. All the exercises for the most part are well known - from sit-ups, leg lifts and lunges, push-up, pull dumbbells in the slope and twists to the press. Part of the exercise will be repeated from level to level, while others will be presented in a more complicated variations (for example, on one leg squats or push-ups with a narrow formulation of the hands.) \nYou will need: weights from 1.5 to 2.5 kg, and in bodibar training intermediate / advanced levels of difficulty.\n\nLevel : Intermediate\nQuality: DVDRip \nFormat: AVI \nVideo: XviD Build 64, 688x384 (1.79:1), 1644 - 1843 Kbps, 25.00 fps, 0-24-0.28 b / px \nAudio: Dolby Digital AC3, 192 Kbps, CBR, 48 kHz and 2 ch.\n\n\n\nHas three upper body / abs programs in addition to the three lower-body workouts (so it's more than just &quot;butt toning&quot;). The three workout &quot;sets&quot; build in intensity - you'll start with the introductory series and advance to the more challenging pair. The moves are mostly straight-forward classics, from squats, leg lifts and lunges to push-ups, dumbbell rows and abdominal crunches. While many exercises are repeated throughout the levels, you also get tougher variations in the later sets (eg one-legged squats or narrow-hand-position push-ups). Pauline Nordin is not your standard instructor. Her cuing is minimal and her chatty commentary is &quot;bad ass&quot; motivational (&quot;Nobody loves this move. Why? Because it hurts!&quot;). Requires 3 to 5 lb. dumbbells; a body bar is also used in one inter / advan workout.
