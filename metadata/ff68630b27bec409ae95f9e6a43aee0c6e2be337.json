But did you know that your disk drive has a built-in system for the secure erasure of data? No? Then read on. What do you mean Ã¢â‚¬Å“deleteÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t delete? File information is maintained in a directory so your operating system can find it.\n\nYou may already know that Ã¢â‚¬Å“deletingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ a file does nothing of the sort. But did you know that your disk drive has a built-in system for the secure erasure of data?\n\nNo? Then read on.\n\nWhat do you mean Ã¢â‚¬Å“deleteÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t delete?\nFile information is maintained in a directory so your operating system can find it. All that Ã¢â‚¬Å“deleteÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ does is erase the fileÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reference information. Your OS canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find it, but the data is still there.\n\nThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what those Ã¢â‚¬Å“file recoveryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ programs look for: data in blocks that the directory says arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t in use.\n\nYou really want to do this\nIf you keep business, medical, or personal financial information on disks, simple deletion isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t enough to protect the data when disposing of the equipment.\n\nBesides identity theft, data loss may leave you or your company liable under federal laws such as HIPAA, Sarbanes-Oxley, Graham-Leach-Bliley or other state laws. Criminal penalties include fines and prison terms up to 20 years. Not to mention the civil suits that can result.\n\nSo whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the magic?\nSomething called Secure Erase, a set of commands embedded in most ATA drives built since 2001. If this is so wonderful, why havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you heard of it before? Because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been disabled by most motherboard BIOSes.\n\nSecure Erase is a loaded gun aimed right at your data. And MurphyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Law is still in force. But hey, if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re smart enough to read Storage Bits, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re smart enough to not play with Secure Erase until you need to.\n\nHow does Secure Erase work?\nSecure Erase overwrites every single track on the hard drive. That includes the data on Ã¢â‚¬Å“bad blocksÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, the data left at the end of partly overwritten blocks, directories, everything. There is no data recovery from Secure Erase.\n\nSays who?\nThe National Security Agency, for one. And the National Institute for Standards and Testing (NIST), who give it a higher security rating than external block overwrite software that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d have to buy. Update: There is an open source external block overwrite utility called Boot and Nuke that is free.\n\nSecure Erase is approved for complying with the legal requirements noted above.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff68630b27bec409ae95f9e6a43aee0c6e2be337","amp;dn":"Hard+Drive+wipe+tools+%28Dban%2C+eraser%2C+ccleaner%2C+hdd+wipe%2C+file+Sh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff68630b27bec409ae95f9e6a43aee0c6e2be337","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,104,99,11,39,190,196,9,174,149,249,230,164,58,238,12,110,43,227,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
