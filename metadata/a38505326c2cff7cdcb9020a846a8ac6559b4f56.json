But the real line is the morality within each character and how far they will go before they cross it.\n\nPlot:\n\nA man discovered shot to death in the back of a car is found to be Harvey Wratten, head of one of London's largest organized crime families, who had been released from jail hours earlier having received a royal pardon for undisclosed reasons. Investigating the murder is DI Jonah Gabriel, a detective in Scotland Yard's serious crimes division. Returning to work, he has no recollection of his last job which went terribly wrong as a result of a bullet lodged in his brain which killed his partner.\n\nThe death of Wratten results in one of his men, Joseph Bede being put forward reluctantly as the new boss of the drug smuggling operation. Bede sets out to find Wratten's killer whilst also trying to contact the cartel's money man, the mysterious Glickman, and has to contend with Harvey's psychotic nephew Jay.\n\nWe follow the investigations into the murder from both sides of the Shadow Line.\n\n\nList of Episodes:\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=653384#pid653384&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=653384#pid653384&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nFormat :\t\tXviD\nFile size:  \t\t550MiB avg. per episode\nDuration : \t\t58min avg. per episode\nWidth : \t\t624 pixels\nHeight : \t\t352 pixels\nAspect ratio :  \t16:9\nFrame rate :    \t25fps\nAudio: \t\t        MP3\nNr. of Files:\t\t7 + 1 TitlePic + 1 Trailer + 1 Teaser + 1 txt = 11\n\n\nAll files properly named, keeping the original file names intact.\nThis pack wouldn't have been possible without you, we worship you,\n\n+++eztv+++TvTeam+++VTV+++scenebalance+++TorrentDay+++eztv+++\n\nAfter 24 hours initial seeding there should be enough seeders to get the whole thing with decent speed in a decent time.\n\n\n######################  You like your show in one pack?  ########################\n##############################  Here you go!  ###################################\n                        VISIT THE KABLAM!!! at SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor questions,requests,comments feel free to PM me on SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a38505326c2cff7cdcb9020a846a8ac6559b4f56","amp;dn":"The+Shadow+Line+-+The+Complete+Series+%28XviD%2FMP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a38505326c2cff7cdcb9020a846a8ac6559b4f56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,133,5,50,108,44,255,124,220,185,2,10,132,106,138,198,85,155,79,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
