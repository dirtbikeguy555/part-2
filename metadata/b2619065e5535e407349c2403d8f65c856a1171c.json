It was recorded in Northern Italy, produced by the band themselves and mixed by Mark ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“SpikeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Stent. In terms of sound and sonic vision The Resistance is their most ambitious long-player yet, which is clearly saying something. They have blown up the robo-funk/monster riff/stadium space rock sound of Black Holes... and widened their viewfinder even further to take in an even greater horizon of sound. \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2619065e5535e407349c2403d8f65c856a1171c","amp;dn":"Muse+-+The+Resistance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2619065e5535e407349c2403d8f65c856a1171c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,97,144,101,229,83,94,64,115,73,194,64,61,143,101,200,86,161,23,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
