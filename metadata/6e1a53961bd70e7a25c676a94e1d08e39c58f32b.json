At the outset of our tale, Roland is a fourteen-year-old gunslinger apprentice, goaded by his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s treacherous sorcerer into taking his test of manhood years too early. Roland thinks that he is fighting for his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s honor, but in truth Marten Broadcloak is in league with GileadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enemy, John Farson, and wants nothing less than to have RolandÃ¢â‚¬â€the final descendant of Arthur Eld, the ancient King of All-WorldÃ¢â‚¬â€sent west in disgrace. Roland wins his guns, but the price is high. With FarsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s assassins haunting the streets of Gilead, Roland and his tet-mates Cuthbert Allgood and Alain Johns must leave the city. Steven Deschain sends the boys to the Outer Arc town of Hambry, but Roland and his tet-mates soon discover that Hambry is not a quiet backwater but the heart of FarsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s war-machineÃ¢â‚¬â€a obliterating juggernaut which has its sights set on Gilead.\n\nSo begins the epic war between RolandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gunslingers and John FarsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s forces, a conflict whose battlefield moves from the Outer Arc to In-World and finally to the gunslingersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ heroic but doomed last stand at the Battle of Jericho Hill. Over the course of the story, Roland transforms from the dinh of a faithful ka-tet to a war-hardened loner, searching for the Dark Tower and for his ultimate enemiesÃ¢â‚¬â€a many-faced sorcerer and his master, an immortal were-spider who wants nothing less than to destroy the Tower and swallow the wreckage of the multiverse.\n\n\n1.
