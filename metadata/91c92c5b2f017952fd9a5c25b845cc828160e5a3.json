The How and Why of One Variable Calculus closes this gap in providing a rigorous treatment that takes an original and valuable approach between calculus and analysis.Logically organized and user-friendly, it covers 6 main topics; real numbers, sequences, continuity, differentiation, integration, and series. Primarily concerned with developing an understanding of the tools of calculus, it features numerous examples and exercises that illustrate how the techniques of calculus have universal application. Key features:\n-  Provides a user-friendly text with more attention to rigour than is usually found in traditional calculus texts.\n-  Can be used both as a first course and as a text for a bridge course between calculus and upper level mathematics.\n-  Presents numerous illustrations, examples, exercises and detailed solutions to aid the readerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s understanding.\n\nThe How and Why of One Variable Calculus presents an excellent text for a first course in calculus for students in the mathematical sciences, statistics and business analytics. It can also be used as a text for a bridge course between single and multi-variable calculus, as well as between single variable calculus and upper level theory courses for math majors.\n\nAbout the Author &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s30.postimg.org/bn7h69ytt/sasane.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s30.postimg.org/bn7h69ytt/sasane.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nDr Amol Sasane is Associate Professor at Department of Mathematics, London School of Economics\nEducation: 1997-2001 PhD in Mathematics, University of Groningen, The Netherlands\n1993-1997 Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay\nBooks published: Algebras of Holomorphic Functions and Control Theory (Dover, New York, 2009)\nHankel Norm Approximation for Infinite-Dimensional Systems\nLecture Notes in Control and Information Sciences 277, Springer, Berlin, 2002.\n\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface ix\nIntroduction xi\nPreliminary notation xv\n1 The real numbers 1\n2 Sequences 44\n3 Continuity 86\n4 Differentiation 125\n5 Integration 183\n6 Series 297\nAppendix 335\nNotes 337\nSolutions 338\nBibliography 493\nIndex 495\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s3.postimg.org/5akqdbrzn/The_How_And_Why_Of_One_Variable_Calculus.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s3.postimg.org/5akqdbrzn/The_How_And_Why_Of_One_Variable_Calculus.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91c92c5b2f017952fd9a5c25b845cc828160e5a3","amp;dn":"The+How+And+Why+Of+One+Variable+Calculus+%28gnv46%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91c92c5b2f017952fd9a5c25b845cc828160e5a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,201,44,91,47,1,121,82,253,154,92,37,184,69,204,130,129,96,229,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
