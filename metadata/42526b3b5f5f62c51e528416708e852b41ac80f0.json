My aim is to help you understand how to make yourself profitable.\nThere may not appear to be a profound difference in the above statements, but letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s remember that the vast majority of traders, and active investors for that matter, are losers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or, at best, marginal winners. However, with a change in thinking and to the way you manage your trades, you can become a profitable trader.\nIt is not about how often you win but how much you win when you win and how much you lose when you lose. I will show you how to skew the numbers in your favour.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42526b3b5f5f62c51e528416708e852b41ac80f0","amp;dn":"Successful+Stock+Trading+by+Nick+Radge+-+helperboy+%5Bpdf%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42526b3b5f5f62c51e528416708e852b41ac80f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,82,107,59,95,95,98,197,30,82,132,22,112,142,133,43,65,172,128,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
