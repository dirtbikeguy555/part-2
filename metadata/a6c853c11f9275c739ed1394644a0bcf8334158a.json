Originally issued by the notorious bootleg label Jazz Door with six selections from a Laren, Holland concert in 1974, Milestone acquired the masters for a legitimate release and added four bonus tunes from a concert in Antwerp, Belgium a week later. Getz meshes almost perfectly with Evans' trio (with bassist Eddie GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³mez and drummer Marty Morell), with only one sore spot: Getz ignored the pianist's request not to play the under-rehearsed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStan's Blues,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which provoked Evans into quickly dropping out and signaling his sidemen to avoid solos of their own. But the remaining tracks are all invigorating, particularly Evans' brisk ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFunkalleroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the lush take of Jimmy Rowles' ballad ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Peacocks.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ It seems a shame that there were not additional opportunities for Getz and Evans to work together on other occasions, but it is possible that their strong personalities would have clashed. Highly recommended! ~ AllMusic.com\n\nThis is the second and most successful of the recorded musical meetings between two giants. The first was a 1964 studio session that, for various reasons, didn't click; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBut Beautiful,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ on the other hand, is a 1974 European concert recording kept in the vaults until 1995.  It's a strong outing by Getz (don't be thrown by previous reviews) but a rather tentative, uneven offering on Bill's part. \n\nThere's some extra-musical drama unfolding during the concert. Bill was miffed when Stan, despite earlier assurances, launched into an unannounced, unrehearsed blues, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStan's Blues,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for the second number of the set. As a result, he sat impassively at the piano, refusing to play and even forbidding Eddie Gomez to take a bass solo. Under the circumstances, Getz carries on practically heroically, taking the tune entirely upon his own shoulders and submitting a series of inventive, grooving choruses in F. The next tune is ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBut Beautiful,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and Bill does something I've never heard him do on record: he loses track of the chord progression for the last eight bars of the song during Getz's solo! \n\nAfter this halting beginning, the foursome settles down, with Bill's trio turning in an uncharacteristically swinging, straightahead set behind the irrepressible Stan, especially on a driving ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFunkallero.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Then immediately following ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe PeacocksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Stan more than makes amends to Bill, offering him a big bouquet of musical roses in the form of an unaccompanied ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHappy BirthdayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (it was the day of Bill's 44th). ~ Samuel Chell\n\n\nPersonnel: \nBill Evans, piano \nStan Getz, tenor saxophone \nEddie Gomez, bass \nMarty Morell, drums \n\nBill Evans Trio w Stan Getz - But Beautiful Tracks: \n01  Grandfather's Waltz 7:45 \n02  Stan's Blues 5:32 \n03  But Beautiful 5:26 \n04  Emily 5:26 \n05  Lover Man 7:50 \n06  Funkallero 6:18 \n07  The Peacocks 6:47 \n08  You And The Night And The Music 7:24 \n09  See-Saw 6:22 \n10  The Two Lonely People 7:58 \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6c853c11f9275c739ed1394644a0bcf8334158a","amp;dn":"Bill+Evans+Trio+w+Stan+Getz+-+But+Beautiful+%281974%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+32","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6c853c11f9275c739ed1394644a0bcf8334158a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,200,83,193,31,146,117,199,57,237,19,148,100,74,11,207,131,52,21,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
