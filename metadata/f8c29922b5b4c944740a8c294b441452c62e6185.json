He is the creation of Scottish author and physician Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. A brilliant London-based detective, Holmes is famous for his intellectual prowess and ratiocination, and is renowned for his skillful use of &quot;deductive reasoning&quot; while using abductive reasoning (inference to the best explanation) and astute observation to solve difficult cases. He is arguably the most famous fictional detective ever created, and is one of the best known and most universally recognisable literary characters in any genre.\n\nConan Doyle wrote four novels and fifty-six short stories that featured Holmes. All but four stories are narrated by Holmes' friend and biographer, Dr. John H. Watson; two are narrated by Holmes himself, and two others are written in the third person. The first two stories, short novels, appeared in Beeton's Christmas Annual for 1887 and Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in 1890. The character grew tremendously in popularity with the beginning of the first series of short stories in The Strand magazine in 1891; further series of short stories and two serialised novels appeared almost right up to Conan Doyle's death in 1930. The stories cover a period from around 1878 up to 1903, with a final case in 1914.\n\n\n\nVolume 1: A Study in Scarlet (1887)\n\nOne of the four novels within the sixty episodes of the Sherlock Holmes canon, A Study in Scarlet(1877) marked the debut of Holmes and his assistant, Dr. Watson, along with their residence at 221 B Baker Street, Inspector Lestrade, and the ragtag band of Street urchins Holmes referred to as &quot;the Baker street Irregulars.&quot; Doyle modeled Holmes in part upon the idiosyncrasies of one of his medical school instructors, Dr. Joseph Bell; the literary structure, however, he borrowed from Edgar Allan Poe's stories of Auguste Dupin. The brilliant but eccentric detective, the admiring friend who narrates the story, the cases which are puzzling and fantastic as much as sensationally criminal, the dramatically revealed solution at the end; all these are elaborated from Poe's work.\n\n\nVolume 2: The Sign of the Four (1890)\n\nThe great detective's melancholy mood is lifted by the arrival of attractive Mary Morstan at 221B Baker Street. Mary's father vanished ten years ago. Four years later she bagan to receive, annually, a large, lustrous pearl. Now she has had an intriguing invitation to meet her unknown benefactor and urges Holmes and Watson to accompany her.
