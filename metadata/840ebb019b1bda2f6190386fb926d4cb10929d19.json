The show premiered on August 11, 1991 on Nickelodeon as part of its Nicktoons block along with Rugrats and Doug. The series focuses on the titular characters: Ren HÃƒÂ¶ek, a psychotic chihuahua, and Stimpson J. Cat, a good-natured, dimwitted cat. The show ran for five seasons on the network. The show was rated TV-Y7 on Nickelodeon/Nicktoons, and TV-PG on the Spike TV repeats.\n\nThe show has received very positive reviews and developed a cult following during and after its run, while some critics credit it for leading the way for satirical animated shows like Beavis and Butt-head and South Park, and playing a significant role in television animation. Throughout its run, The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show was controversial for its off-color humor, sexual innuendo, and violence, each of which contributed to the production staff's altercations with Nickelodeon's Standards and Practices department. A spin-off for adult audiences, Ren &amp; Stimpy &quot;Adult Party Cartoon&quot;, aired in 2003 on Spike, but was poorly received and was cancelled soon after its debut.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:840ebb019b1bda2f6190386fb926d4cb10929d19","amp;dn":"REN+AND+STIMPY+%5BSEASONS+1-5%5D%5BVERIFIED-VIDZ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"840ebb019b1bda2f6190386fb926d4cb10929d19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,14,187,1,155,27,218,47,97,144,56,111,185,38,212,203,16,146,157,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
