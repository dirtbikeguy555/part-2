As Bering takes us into the lives of a woman who falls madly in love with the Eiffel Tower, a young man addicted to seductive sneezes, and a pair of deeply affectionate identical twins, among others, he challenges us to move beyond our judgments and attitudes toward &quot;deviant&quot; sex and consider the alternative: What would happen if we rise above our fears and revulsions and accepted our true natures?\n\nWith his signature wit and irreverent style, Bering pulls back the curtains on the history of perversions, the biological reasons behind our distaste for unusual sexual proclivities, and the latest research on desire. Armed with reason, science, and an insatiable appetite for knowledge, he humanizes deviants while asking some very provocative questions about the nature of hypocrisy, prejudice, and when sexual desire can lead to harm.\n\nA groundbreaking look at our complex relationship with our carnal urges and the ways in which we disguise, deny, and shame the sexual deviant in all of us, Perv brings our hidden desires into the light.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f14fb2a0f9b1039bf50c9ca9066e22c601b9e06","amp;dn":"Perv%3A+The+Sexual+Deviant+in+All+of+Us+-+Jesse+Bering+-+Audiobook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f14fb2a0f9b1039bf50c9ca9066e22c601b9e06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,20,251,42,15,155,16,57,191,80,201,202,144,102,226,44,96,27,158,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
