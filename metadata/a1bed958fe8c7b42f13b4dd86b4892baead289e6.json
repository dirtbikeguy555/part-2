But where do they come from? What kind of environment breeds them? What sparks the flash of brilliance? How do we generate the groundbreaking ideas that push forward our lives, our society, our culture? Steven JohnsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s answers are revelatory as he identifies the seven key patterns behind genuine innovation, and traces them across time and disciplines. From Darwin and Freud to the halls of Google and Apple, Johnson investigates the innovation hubs throughout modern time and pulls out applicable approaches and commonalities that seem to appear at moments of originality. What he finds gives us both an important new understanding of the roots of innovation and a set of useful strategies for cultivating our own creative breakthroughs.\n\nSteven Johnson's next book, Future Perfect, will be available Fall 2012 from Riverhead Books.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1bed958fe8c7b42f13b4dd86b4892baead289e6","amp;dn":"History+of+Things+-+01+-+Where+Good+Ideas+Come+From+-+The+Natura","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1bed958fe8c7b42f13b4dd86b4892baead289e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,190,217,88,254,140,123,66,241,59,77,216,107,72,146,186,234,210,137,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
