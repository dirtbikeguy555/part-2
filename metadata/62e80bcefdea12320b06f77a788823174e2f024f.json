Blending eerie, surging grooves influenced by Black Sabbath with thrashy speed metal riffs, Pantera\ncreated a bleak, oppressive disc that captured both ends of the speed spectrum without resorting to clichÃŽËœ, abrupt tempo shifts. Guitarist Diamond Darrell plays with as much crunch as the best Metallica, while vocalist Phil Anselmo screams loud enough to satisfy any GBH fan. Coupled with Vinnie Paul's insistent, double bass-drum onslaught, you're left with a record that's a dentist's wet dream--an album that'll shake the fillings out of even the strongest teeth. --Jon Wiederhorn\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic. HHI has no opinion with regard to the quality of the Artist. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Mouth for war                                        [03:57]\n02.A new level                                          [03:58]\n03.Walk                                                 [05:15]\n04.Fucking hostile                                      [02:49]\n05.This love                                            [06:33]\n06.Rise                                                 [04:37]\n07.No good (attack the radical)                         [04:50]\n08.Live in A hole                                       [05:00]\n09.Regular people (conceit)                             [05:28]\n10.By demons be driven                                  [04:40]\n11.Hollow                                               [05:46]\n________\n52:53 min\n 88,1 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
