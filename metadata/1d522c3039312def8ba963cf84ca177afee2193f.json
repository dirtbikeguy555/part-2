So thanks to TPB members (and KAT) Only1Joe for Mariah Carey debut, Oneanight for Lovesongs, Bubanee for #1's, Bigsimon for E-MC2 and Michi80 for Emotions. So thanks guys! I'm not sure who upped the other 2 albums so cannot give credit. EAC logs and/or Audiochecker logs included for all albums. Glitter was ripped in burst mode due to minor scuffing of the disc and has some Timing errors. My apologies.\n\n\nKit \n\n\n\nPlease help seed these FLACs! \n\n\nFrom Wiki:\n\nMariah Carey (born March 27, 1969 or 1970[1]) is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, actress, and philanthropist. Born and raised on Long Island, New York, Carey came to prominence after releasing her self-titled debut studio album Mariah Carey in 1990; it went multi-platinum and spawned four consecutive number one singles on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. Under guidance of Columbia Records executive and later husband Tommy Mottola, she continued booking success with followup albums Emotions (1991), Music Box (1993), and Merry Christmas (1994), Carey was established as Columbia's highest-selling act. Daydream (1995) made music history when its second single &quot;One Sweet Day&quot;, a duet with Boyz II Men, spent a record sixteen weeks on top of the Billboard Hot 100, and remains the longest-running number-one song in U.S. chart history. During the recording of the album, Carey began to deviate from her R&amp;B and pop beginnings and slowly traversed into hip hop. This musical change became evident with the release of Butterfly (1997), at which time Carey had separated from Mottola. \n\n\n\n* Due to length of description I had to truncate it as TPB doesn't allow lengthy descriptions.\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy Mariah Carey :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1d522c3039312def8ba963cf84ca177afee2193f","amp;dn":"Mariah+Carey+-+Discography+1990+-+2010+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1d522c3039312def8ba963cf84ca177afee2193f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,82,44,48,57,49,45,239,139,169,99,207,132,202,23,122,254,226,25,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
