Players control wizards who fight each other with spells and summoned creatures.\n\nSacrifice places little emphasis on resource gathering and management. There is no system of workers; the players' wizards collect souls to summon creatures, and their manaÃ¯Â¿Â½energy for casting spellsÃ¯Â¿Â½constantly regenerates. Players customize their attacks by choosing from spells and creatures aligned to five gods. To defeat an opponent, the player's wizard sacrifices a friendly unit at the opposing wizard's altar, thereby desecrating it and banishing the enemy wizard.\n\nWhat's Included:\nSacrifice Sountrack\nSacrifice High Resolution Wallpapers\nSacrifice Avatars\nSacrifice Artworks\nSacrifice PDF manual\nSacrifice Reference Card\nSacrifice Map Pack\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nÃ¯Â¿Â½ Windows XP or Windows Vista\nÃ¯Â¿Â½ 1 GHz Processor (1.4 GHz recommended)\nÃ¯Â¿Â½ 256MB RAM (512 recommended)\nÃ¯Â¿Â½ 3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 7 (compatible with DirectX 9 recommended)\nÃ¯Â¿Â½ Mouse, Keyboard.\n\n\nInstall and Play","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f29b38fb11963931e6cb0c58c8b8035aeadacfec","amp;dn":"Sacrifice+GoG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f29b38fb11963931e6cb0c58c8b8035aeadacfec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,155,56,251,17,150,57,49,230,203,12,88,200,184,3,90,234,218,207,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
