One day| Clyde stops his car in a yard sale and Em buys an antique carved box and becomes obsessed with it. Em finds the\r\nhidden lock and releases an evil spirit that possesses her. Soon Clyde discovers that Em has a problem| but his annoying ex-wife and her boyfriend Brett do not pay\r\nattention to him and get a restraining order against Clyde. Clyde seeks out Professor McMannis and when he sees the box| he explains that it is a Dibbuk Box| where a\r\nfiend is trapped inside. He also explains that the box should not be open; otherwise the person will be possessed by the spirit.
