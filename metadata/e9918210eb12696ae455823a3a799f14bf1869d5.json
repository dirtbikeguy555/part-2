The group has a glam-like image and implements musically elements of classic heavy metal bands such as Judas Priest and Iron Maiden as did some of the earlier glam metal bands. However, Dee Snider, the group&amp;#039;s frontman, has been quoted as saying:\n\n    I don&amp;#039;t think Twisted Sister is &quot;glam&quot; because that implies glamour, and we&amp;#039;re not glamorous.\n    We should be called &quot;Hid&quot; because we&amp;#039;re hideous.[2][3]\n\nAlthough the band was formed by guitarist Jay Jay French in 1973, all of their songs were written by lead singer Dee Snider. He describes Twisted Sister as &quot;Slade meets Sex Pistols&quot;. The group&amp;#039;s hits include &quot;We&amp;#039;re Not Gonna Take It&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Rock&quot;, both popularized by regular airplay on MTV in the 1980s. Many of the band&amp;#039;s songs explore themes of parent vs. child conflicts and criticisms of the educational system.[4]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9918210eb12696ae455823a3a799f14bf1869d5","amp;dn":"Twisted+Sister+%28+7+albums+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9918210eb12696ae455823a3a799f14bf1869d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,145,130,16,235,18,105,106,228,85,130,58,58,121,159,20,191,24,105,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
