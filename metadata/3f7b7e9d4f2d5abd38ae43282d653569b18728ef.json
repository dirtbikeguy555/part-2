In each of these domains, there are recurring patterns, and by looking closely at them, we can learn much about the predicament of our worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and the direction we must take if &quot;global transformation&quot; is to become a reality. \n\nWilber offers a series of striking and original views on many topics of current interest and controversy, including the gender wars, modern liberation movements, multiculturalism, ecology and environmental ethics, and the conflict between this-worldly and otherworldly approaches to spirituality. The result is an extraordinary and exhilarating ride through the Kosmos in the company of one of the great thinkers of our time.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/dp/1570627401&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/dp/1570627401&lt;/a&gt;\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThe document is a djvu file.
