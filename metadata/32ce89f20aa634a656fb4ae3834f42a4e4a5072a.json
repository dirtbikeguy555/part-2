So why do we discard this invaluable ritual as grown-ups to the detriment of our well-being and good health?\r\nIn this groundbreaking anthology, Ben Holden, editor of the bestselling Poems That Make Grown Men Cry, challenges how we think about life, a third of which is spent asleep. He deftly explores not only the science of sleep but also why we endlessly tell stories â€“ even to ourselves, as we dream.\r\nHolden combines his own illuminating storytelling with a treasure trove of timeless classics and contemporary gems. Poems and short stories, fairy tales and fables, reveries and nocturnes â€“ from William Shakespeare to Haruki Murakami, Charles Dickens to Roald Dahl, Rabindranath Tagore to Nora Ephron, Vladimir Nabokov to Neil Gaiman â€“ are all woven together to replicate the journey of a single nightâ€™s sleep.\r\nSome of todayâ€™s greatest storytellers reveal their choice of the ideal grown-up bedtime story: writers such as Margaret Drabble, Ken Follett, Tessa Hadley, Joanne Harris; Robert Macfarlane, Patrick Ness, Tony Robinson and Warsan Shire.\r\nFold away your laptop and shut down your mobile phone. Curl up and crash out with the ultimate bedside book, one youâ€™ll return to again and again. Full of laughter and tears, moonlight and magic,Bedtime Stories for Grown-ups joyfully provides the dream way to end the day â€“ and begin the night . . .\r\n\r\nEnjoy and please SEED!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32ce89f20aa634a656fb4ae3834f42a4e4a5072a","amp;dn":"Bedtime+Stories+for+Grown-ups+-+Ben+Holden+%5BEN+EPUB%5D+%5Bebook%5D+%5Bp_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32ce89f20aa634a656fb4ae3834f42a4e4a5072a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,206,137,242,10,166,52,166,86,251,74,227,131,79,66,164,228,165,7,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
