Keen-eyed fans may also spot cameos by other familiar mutants, such as Feral, Rictor, Deadpool, and Blink.\n\nA number of famous storylines and events from the comics are loosely adapted in the series, such as The Dark Phoenix Saga, Days of Future Past, the Phalanx Covenant, and the Legacy Virus. The third episode, &quot;Enter Magneto&quot;, features a confrontation at a missile base: this is largely based on the X-Men's first battle with Magneto, as told in their 1963 debut X-Men #1. The season four episodes &quot;Sanctuary, Parts I &amp; II&quot;, which involve Magneto creating an orbiting haven for mutants, were influenced by several storylines from the comics, chiefly the first three issues of X-Men (Volume 2) and the &quot;Fatal Attractions&quot; crossover.\n\nBeyond faithfully recreating many of the popular characters and stories from the comic books, the series also dealt fairly openly with mature social issues. The ills of prejudice, intolerance, isolation, and racism were all frequent themes in the animated series, as they were in the comics. Anti-mutant prejudice and discrimination was depicted through minor characters as well as more prominent ones, including Senator Robert Kelly, the Friends of Humanity and robotic Sentinels.\n\nThe series also deals with other social issues, including divorce (&quot;Proteus&quot;), Christianity (&quot;Nightcrawler&quot; &amp; &quot;Bloodlines&quot;), the Holocaust (&quot;Enter Magneto,&quot; &quot;Deadly Reunions&quot;, &quot;Days of Future Past&quot;, and &quot;The Phalanx Covenant&quot;), AIDS hysteria (&quot;Time Fugitives&quot;), and even satires of television itself (&quot;Mojovision&quot; and &quot;Longshot&quot;).\n\n\nVIDEO INFO *** : x264-core 80 r1376 3feaec2 @ 1,342 Kbps Avg\nFRAME RATE *** : 23.976 fps\nRESOLUTION *** : 1024 x 422 (2.427 : 1)\nAUDIO INFO *** : DTS 3/2.1 CH @ 768 Kbps\nLANGUAGE ***** : English\nSUBTITLE ***** : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc80709c9a33ba1a6b11e23646e3493ca6c22b9c","amp;dn":"X-Men+Cartoon+Complete+Seasons+1-5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc80709c9a33ba1a6b11e23646e3493ca6c22b9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,128,112,156,154,51,186,26,107,17,226,54,70,227,73,60,166,194,43,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
