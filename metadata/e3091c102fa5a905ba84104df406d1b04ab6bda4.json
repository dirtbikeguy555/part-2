This virtual instrument was designed to be a true successor to our original Shreddage electric rhythm guitar library, released in 2010 and used by thousands of composers and producers all over the world. With that release, our goal was to create an easy-to-use set of DI rock &amp; metal guitar sounds, pushing the envelope of realism and establishing a new standard for electric guitar samples. We were content to focus strictly on rhythm playing, with the idea that perhaps other virtual instruments would service for lead playing.\n\nHowever, as useful as the original Shreddage was, our users overwhelmingly desired a true sequel: an instrument that would take the incredible realism of Shreddage and apply it to a comprehensive library capable of lead playing as well. Other libraries have attempted this challenge, but through our own experiences and the words of our users, we discovered common problems: bloated memory and CPU usage, limited range, incomprehensible mapping and keyswitches, overly complex scripting, and a lack of attention to detail &amp; realism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n   Drop G tuning\n   All frets on all strings\n   Up to 5x palm mute layers\n   Up to 8x RR\n   Single notes and powerchords\n   Three vibrato types\n   Multiple picking modes\n   Pinch harmonics\n   Hammer-on / pull-off playing\n   Tonal and atonal release noises\n   Staccato notes\n   Portamento slides w/ speed controls\n   Advanced scripting with 40+ options\n   Fretboard monitor\n   Built-in signal chain FX (toggle)\n   Per-note / per-articulation RR\n\n\nRequirements\n\n* Compatible with KONTAKT PLAYER 5\n* Editable in KONTAKT 5+\n* Requires 4gb disk space\n\n\n\n\nmore at --&gt; http://impactsoundworks.com/products/guitar-and-bass/shreddage-2-absolute-electric-guitar/\n\n\nINSTALLATION\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ You need WinRAR to extract the rar's files.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Add The Library To KONTAKT\n\n\n         Ã¢â‚¬Â¢  That's it!
