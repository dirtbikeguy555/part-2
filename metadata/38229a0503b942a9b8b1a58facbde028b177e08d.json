Ward. It's more than just the sum of its parts, and after you listen to it, you will probably have a greater appreciation for the fact that these four gentlemen are truly prolific, creative, and brilliant artists who have created some of the most timeless American music of the past 10 years, both with this project and with their respective bands. Enjoy, and go catch the tour if you can!\n\n\n1 Dear God (sincerely M.O.F.)\n2 Say Please\n3 Whole Lotta LosinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢\n4 Temazcal\n5 The Right Place\n6 Baby Boomer\n7 Man Named Truth\n8 Goodway\n9 Ahead of the Curve\n10 Slow Down Jo\n11 Losin Yo Head\n12 Magic Marker\n13 Map Of The World\n14 The Sandman, the Brakeman and Me\n15 His MasterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Voice","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38229a0503b942a9b8b1a58facbde028b177e08d","amp;dn":"Monsters+Of+Folk+-+Monsters+Of+Folk+%5B2009%2FMP3%2F320%5D%5BBubanee%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38229a0503b942a9b8b1a58facbde028b177e08d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,34,154,5,3,185,66,169,184,177,165,143,172,189,224,40,177,119,224,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
