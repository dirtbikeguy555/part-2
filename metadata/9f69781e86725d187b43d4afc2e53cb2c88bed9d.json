Gameplay is inspired by point-and-click adventure games (like the classic Monkey Island or King's Quest series, or more recently Telltale's Walking Dead series), but focused on characterization, atmosphere and storytelling rather than clever puzzles or challenges of skill.\n\nThe game is developed by Cardboard Computer (Jake Elliott and Tamas Kemenczy). The game's soundtrack features an original electronic score by Ben Babbitt along with a suite of old hymns &amp; bluegrass standards recorded by The Bedquilt Ramblers.\n\nHow to play:\n1) Run setup_krz_act_i.exe and install the game;\n2) Start the game using main executable or shortcuts (DRM free).\n\nIf you like the game, BUY it!\n\nwww.kentuckyroutezero.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f69781e86725d187b43d4afc2e53cb2c88bed9d","amp;dn":"Kentucky++Route++Zero++Act++I","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f69781e86725d187b43d4afc2e53cb2c88bed9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,105,120,30,134,114,93,24,123,67,212,175,194,229,60,178,200,139,237,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
