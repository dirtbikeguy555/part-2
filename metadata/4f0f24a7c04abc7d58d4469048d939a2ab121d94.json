She is my pillar of support, always, and has a laugh, joke or smile for every moment. I hope that she too conquers happiness in every aspect of life - and I'm sure that she will. :-)\n\nPromotional info/Publisher's summary - 'In The Conquest of Happiness, first published by Liveright in 1930, iconoclastic philosopher Bertrand Russell attempted to diagnose the myriad causes of unhappiness in modern life and chart a path out of the seemingly inescapable malaise so prevalent even in safe and prosperous Western societies. More than eighty years later, RussellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wisdom remains as true as it was on its initial release. Eschewing guilt-based morality, Russell lays out a rationalist prescription for living a happy life, including the importance of cultivating interests outside oneself and the dangers of passive pleasure. In this new edition, best-selling philosopher Daniel C. Dennett reintroduces Russell to a new generation, stating that Conquest is both Ã¢â‚¬Å“a fascinating time capsuleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“a prototype of the flood of self-help books that have more recently been published, few of them as well worth reading today as RussellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s little book.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½'\n\nReview:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Should be read by every parent, teacher, minister, and Congressman in the land.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ - The Atlantic\n\nThis copy of the book is the recent reprint edition.
