K. Rowling, published under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith.\n\nBefore Rowling's identity as the book's author was revealed, 1500 copies of the book had been sold since its release in April 2013. The book surged from 4,709th to the 1st best-selling novel on Amazon after it was revealed on 14 July 2013 that the book was written by Rowling under the name &quot;Robert Galbraith&quot;.\n\nThe book received almost universal critical acclaim despite not being a huge commercial event. The website of The Independent states that the book &quot;became a rave-review bestseller without readers realizing she had written it.&quot;\n\nPLOT\n\nDetective Cormoran Strike investigates a super model's suicide. After losing his leg to a land mine in Afghanistan, Cormoran Strike is barely scraping by as a private investigator. Strike is down to one client, and creditors are calling. He has also just broken up with his longtime girlfriend and is living in his office.\n\nThen John Bristow walks through his door with an amazing story: His sister, the legendary supermodel Lula Landry, known to her friends as the Cuckoo, famously fell to her death a few months earlier. The police ruled it a suicide, but John refuses to believe that. The case plunges Strike into the world of multimillionaire beauties, rock-star boyfriends, and desperate designers, and it introduces him to every variety of pleasure, enticement, seduction, and delusion known to man.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:129185aba2f6134764413db226dc96e9d78d5104","amp;dn":"The+Cuckoo%27s+Calling+-+Robert+Galbraith+-+J.K.Rowling.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"129185aba2f6134764413db226dc96e9d78d5104","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,145,133,171,162,246,19,71,100,65,61,178,38,220,150,233,215,141,81,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
