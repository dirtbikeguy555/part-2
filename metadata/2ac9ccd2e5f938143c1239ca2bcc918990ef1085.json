His musical work was mainly conducted with a rotating assembly of musicians called The Magic Band, which was active between the mid-1960s and the early 1980s. Van Vliet was chiefly a singer and harmonica player, occasionally playing saxophone and keyboards. His compositions are characterized by their odd mixtures of shifting time signatures and by their surreal lyrics, while Van Vliet himself is noted for his dictatorial approach to his musicians and for his enigmatic relationship with the public.\nmore: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Beefheart&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Beefheart&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nGenres: Experimental rock, psychedelic rock, blues-rock, avant garde, protopunk \nYears active 1964ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“1982  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.beefheart.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.beefheart.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nTorrent includes\nSafe as Milk (1967) \nStrictly Personal (1968) \nTrout Mask Replica (1969) \nLick My Decals Off, Baby (1970) \nThe Spotlight Kid (1972) \nClear Spot (1972) \nUnconditionally Guaranteed (1974) \nBluejeans &amp; Moonbeams (1974) \nShiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller) (1978) \nDoc at the Radar Station (1980) \nIce Cream for Crow (1982) \n\nand some compilations\n\n\n\n\nAll references to the music, placed above, are presented only for fact-finding listening .. so if you like it - buy it !\n\nAlways Support The Artists And Buy The Original Material And Erase Downloaded Files in 24 hours or less, The Albums Are Not My Uploads...\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ac9ccd2e5f938143c1239ca2bcc918990ef1085","amp;dn":"Captain+Beefheart+-+Discography+%281967-2001%29+%5Bmp3%40192-320%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ac9ccd2e5f938143c1239ca2bcc918990ef1085","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,201,204,210,229,249,56,20,60,18,57,202,43,204,145,137,144,239,16,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
