Won 4.\n\n  Journalism thrillers just don't get any better than All the \n\nPresident's Men. Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford are \n\nperfectly matched as (respectively) Washington Post \n\nreporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, whose \n\ninvestigation of the Watergate scandal led to President \n\nRichard Nixon's resignation. Their bestselling book was \n\nbrilliantly adapted by screenwriter William Goldman, and \n\ndirector Alan Pakula crafted the film into one of the most \n\nintelligent and involving of the 1970s paranoid thrillers. \n\nFeaturing Jason Robards in his Oscar-winning role as \n\nWashington Post editor Ben Bradlee, All the President's Men \n\nis the film against which all other journalism movies must be \n\nmeasured.\n\n  Starring: Dustin Hoffman, Robert Redford, Jack Warden, \n\nMartin Balsam, Hal Holbrook.\n\n  Directed by: Alan J. Pakula.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length: 2hr. 18min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 688 x 432","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b1bfb5d7a710cef9c46a729e4d2da196795e1ab","amp;dn":"All+the+President%5C%27s+Men+%281976%29+%28Dustin+Hoffman%2C+R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b1bfb5d7a710cef9c46a729e4d2da196795e1ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,27,251,93,122,113,12,239,156,70,167,41,228,210,218,25,103,149,225,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
