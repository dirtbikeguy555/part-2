But how does the world see you? If you want to be heard and remembered, if you want people to take action on your ideas and opinions, then you need to get the full picture. Effective messages build a cause-and-effect cycle that creates action. Each time you communicate, you will either be heard, or you will be ignored.\n\nIn How the World Sees You, Sally Hogshead reveals which triggers individuals inherently use when interacting with others. Through her extensive, in-depth proprietary research ranging from market studies to neuroscience, she presents a set of archetypes, or style of persuasion, of different personality brands designed to help individuals understand their strengths and weaknesses and the pros and cons of each.\n\nInviting listeners to take an online assessment, she then explains their results and helps them develop new talents, create more productive teams, and hire ideal employees. How the World Sees You coaches listeners to focus not only on their strengths, but on the distinctive qualities and characteristics that make them different, not just better. As she persuasively shows, Different beats Good ever time.\n\n\nBook references &quot;Fascination Advantage Assessment.&quot;\nLink: http://nullrefer.com/?http://Howtofascinate.com/You\nBook code: NMorgan","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60d36c5b68cbc7e666b0cb59626fc6e3d5d6a4cb","amp;dn":"How+the+World+Sees+You+-+Sally+Hogshead+-+Audiobook+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60d36c5b68cbc7e666b0cb59626fc6e3d5d6a4cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,211,108,91,104,203,199,230,102,176,203,89,98,111,198,227,213,214,164,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
