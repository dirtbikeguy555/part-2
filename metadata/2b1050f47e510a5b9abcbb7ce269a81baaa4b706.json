In 2004, the band achieved commercial success with their debut album, Contraband. Critics initially described Velvet Revolver as a mere combination of Stone Temple Pilots and Guns N&amp;#039; Roses, and criticized the band for a &quot;disconnection&quot; between Scott Weiland and the rest of the band. With their single &quot;Slither&quot;, they won the 2005 Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance.\n\nThe band released Libertad in 2007, driven by the release of the single &quot;She Builds Quick Machines&quot;, and embarked on a tour with Alice in Chains. The following year, frontman Scott Weiland was fired from the band, for erratic behavior on and off stage and allegedly not being committed to the fans or the music.\n\n=================================================================\nArtist    - Velvet Revolver        \nAlbum     - various                                           \nGenre     - rock                                              \nLabel     - Sony BMG/RCA \nYear      - 2003-2008                                             \nTracks    - n/a                                                \nPlaytime  - n/a\nFile Type - .mp3\nSize      - 264.23\nkbps      - 198 or higher\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/phrozin1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/phrozin1&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy.
