They are one of the most popular Italian rock/hip hop groups. Members are rapper J Ax (real name Alessandro Aleotti) and DJ Jad (Vito Luca Perrini). The band took its name from the Irish constitutional law guaranteeing freedom of the press. Articolo 31 was one of the first hip hop groups in Italy, releasing one of the first Italian hip hop records, Strade di cittÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â , in 1993. Soon, they signed with BMG Ricordi and started to mix their rap with pop music, obtaining great success and popularity. However, the underground hip hop scene positioned them as traitors.Their producer was Franco Godi, who also produced the music for the Signor Rossi animated series. In 1997, DJ Gruff dissed Articolo 31 in a track titled 1 vs 2 appearing on the first album of the beatmaker Fritz da Cat, but Articolo 31's lawyers obtained a retraction of the record, and its reissue without the song.\nIn 2001, Articolo 31 collaborated with the American old school rapper Kurtis Blow on the album XChÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© SI!. In the same year, they made the movie Senza filtro (in English, &quot;Without filter&quot;). With Domani smetto, Articolo 31 left the world of hip hop and moved to rap with many influences; even more so than previously, this album found them rapping and singing to rock and pop tracks. In recent years, J Ax and DJ Jad have each released solo records, and in 2006, the group declared an indefinite hiatus.\n\n.: Articolo 31 Group :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://onlyrespect.ilcannocchiale.it/blogs/bloggerarchimg/oNLyResPeCt/Immaginegiadavaz.JPG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://onlyrespect.ilcannocchiale.it/blogs/bloggerarchimg/oNLyResPeCt/Immaginegiadavaz.JPG&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums :.\n\nStudio albums\n1993 E' Natale (Ma Io Non Ci Sto Dentro) @192\n1993 Strade Di CittÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  @320\n1994 Messa di vespiri @320VBR\n1996 CosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¬ com'ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ @320VBR\n1998 Nessuno @320VBR\n1999 XchÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ si! @320VBR\n2000 Greatest hits @320VBR\n2002 Domani smetto @320VBR\n2003 Italiano medio @320VBR\n\nLive albums\n2005 La riconquista del forum (CD+DVD version) @320VBR\\CD\n2005 Italiano Medio Tour DVD rip\n\nJ-Ax solo albums\n2006 Di Sana Pianta @320\n\nDJ Jad solo album\n2004 Back On Track @128 (2 CD)\n2006 Milano - New York @320","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46f0930729c715d505e8e40805b61c50206804e0","amp;dn":"Articolo+31+Discography+1993-2006+%5B320+kbps%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46f0930729c715d505e8e40805b61c50206804e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,240,147,7,41,199,21,213,5,232,228,8,5,182,28,80,32,104,4,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
