This astonishing two-year period witnessed the singer score nine Top 10 hits and define soul music.\nPairing with producer Jerry Wexler and a flawless Muscle Shoals studio band, Franklin unleashed bolder sides of her artistry kept under wraps during her tenure at Columbia. The rest is history-a history that, until now, has never been in heard in true audiophile sound. And if thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s any voice you want to experience to the most realistic extent, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that of the vocalist Rolling Stone crowned the Greatest Singer of All Time. Mastered from the original master tapes, Mobile FidelityÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hybrid SACD of ArethaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gold presents FranklinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most seminal early Atlantic songsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nwith reference-standard sonics.\n\nFinally, hear the full range of the Queen of SoulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s depth, reach, and expressiveness. Complementing her timeless classics with tremendous dynamics, restored balances, and stunning clarity, this collectable SACD sheds new light on FranklinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s power and technique, honesty and confidence, enunciation and directness.\n\nHear why Franklin is even better than you likely think or remember. You just havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been able to hear the Detroit native on a format that mirrors exactly what went down in the studios when she recorded songs that, to this day, remain the bar by which all other singers are measured. The same goes for FranklinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s backing band, known as the Swampers, whose instrumental savvy, feel, and textures are so unique, the group is credited with creating its own style: The Muscle Shoals Sound. On this edition of ArethaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gold, experience every picked guitar note, brushed snare, and fluid bass line. Seldom has a band and vocalist ever made a more formidable, memorable, and emotional combination.\n\nThe evidence plays out across these 14 songs, each a soul landmark, each unforgettable thanks to FranklinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impassioned performances and empowering attitude. The Sweet Impressions (FranklinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s backing vocalists) and sweeping string arrangements bolster the foundation, but the material belongs to Franklin. A veritable hit parade, the track listing on ArethaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gold reads like a dictionary of soul.\n\nYou know the songs by heart. You know the voice by memory. But youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never quite known them so intimately. ArethaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Gold on Mobile Fidelity gives the Queen the royal treatment she deserves.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:902a9003909e475d8a07f6a40487e0083ff8e687","amp;dn":"Aretha+Franklin+-+Aretha%26rsquo%3Bs+Gold+%282014%29+MFSL+SACD+FLAC+Beol","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"902a9003909e475d8a07f6a40487e0083ff8e687","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,42,144,3,144,158,71,93,138,7,246,164,4,135,224,8,63,248,230,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
