Never to be found on my pages. Katy Perry Smiley Virus or Vermin van Burin(who is he)and many others who will disappear after the 15 seconds of &quot;Fame&quot; I like and listen to all the stuff I post thats why I post it. Understand?  Cool. Some reggae makes the cut and of course Johnny Cash and a few of the other outlaws.But 9o percent is Metal-Hard Rock and just a bit of the Classic Rock.
