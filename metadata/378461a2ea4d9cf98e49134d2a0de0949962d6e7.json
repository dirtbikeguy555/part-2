With either the playback software or Tunebite, additional copyrighted music &amp; audio book files can be copied by using the virtual CD-burner.\n\nTunebite has one of a kind quality control with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPerfectAudioÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, guaranteeing error-free audio output.

In the process, Tunebite legally photographs, frame by frame, the replayed, copyrighted films &amp; saves them in the desired format. Tunebite informs you of the expected output quality of the files to be converted based on the operating system and PC performance &amp; also warns of a loss in quality before converting files on PCs with weaker performance. The quality is also inspected during conversion. After the conversion is complete, Tunebite provides tips, in the rare event that problems do arise, to avoid such problems that may occur.
