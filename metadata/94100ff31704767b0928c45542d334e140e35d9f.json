But learning a new language can be an unmanageably long endeavor. Join Gabriel Wyner to learn how you can become (and stay) fluent in a new language in months, not years.\nThroughout this course, you'll explore memorization tools, linguistic concepts, and free software that will ensure fluency in the shortest amount of time possible. You'll learn about the four essential stages of language acquisition: understanding correct pronunciation, building vocabulary and grammar skills, reading and listening effectively, and conversing with native speakers. You'll also learn about antiquated methods to avoid (such as translating between new and native languages) and cutting-edge new techniques that ensure maximum absorption and retention.\n\nBy the end of this course, you'll have an easy system for learning, retaining, and expressing yourself in a new language as quickly as possible","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94100ff31704767b0928c45542d334e140e35d9f","amp;dn":"creativeLIVE+-+Become+Fluent+in+Any+Language+with+Gabriel+Wyner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94100ff31704767b0928c45542d334e140e35d9f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,16,15,243,23,4,118,123,9,40,196,85,66,211,52,225,64,227,93,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
