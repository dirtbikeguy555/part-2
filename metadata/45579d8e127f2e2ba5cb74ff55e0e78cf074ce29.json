Sir David Attenborough hosts this unprecedented and extraordinary global look at the magnificent and often curious winged species with which we share our planet. \n\nLike the best wildlife shows, The Life of Birds offers a fresh and accessible view of creatures we may take for granted (didn't Alfred Hitchcock warn us about that?). The focus of this series is not on the different bird species, but on bird behaviour. Remarkable and awe-inspiring footage preserves the wide range of tools and techniques with which birds fly, hunt for food, attract a mate, hatch their chicks and defend themselves against predators. \n\nAttenborough pops up in the most remote, most exotic locales, with occasional comic effect: at one point, night-vision cameras capture the rare sight of the nocturnal kiwi as it forages for food on a New Zealand beach; the camera pans to reveal scant paces away our guide shining a flashlight on the nonplussed bird.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45579d8e127f2e2ba5cb74ff55e0e78cf074ce29","amp;dn":"The+Life+of+Birds++%28BBC+1988+-+Complete+Series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45579d8e127f2e2ba5cb74ff55e0e78cf074ce29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,87,157,142,18,127,46,43,165,203,116,255,85,224,231,140,240,116,206,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
