I completely forgot about this persons request in my attempt to find as many Johnnie Taylor songs as possible.\n\nMr. Taylor had quite a number of SOUL songs that always operated near the threshold of RAUNCHY. I mean it is something to hear the sexual implication in music given the time these songs were sung in. R Kelly has nothing on this guy. Nonetheless I have gathered up some of the popular albums of this man and hope you all enjoy it.\n\nHer is a WIKI link for more info on Johnnie Taylor's beginnings up to his success as a vocalist in many genre.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnnie_Taylor&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnnie_Taylor&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2f9de280fc60986458251b6af68bdc5bd83beda","amp;dn":"JOHNNY+TAYLOR+DISCOGRAPHY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2f9de280fc60986458251b6af68bdc5bd83beda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,249,222,40,15,198,9,134,69,130,81,182,175,104,189,197,189,131,190,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
