Some have not necessarily lived up to that title, but others, such as this one do, and it might also be called this jazz pianist and composer's most memorable hits.\n\nDave Brubeck's Greatest Hits is not a new album. Released in the mid-1960s as a vinyl LP, it features Dave Brubeck on piano, Paul Desmond on alto sax, Eugene Wright on bass, and Joe Morello on drums. It was produced by Teo Macero, who also produced the legendary Time Out album featuring the Dave Brubeck Quartet on Columbia Records in 1959, and these two albums have been personal jazz favorites since the 1960s when purchased original on vinyl during that era.\n\n1. Take Five\n2. I'm In A Dancing Mood\n3. In Your Own Sweet Way\n4. Camptown Races\n5. The Duke (live version)\n6. It's A Raggy Waltz\n7. Bossa Nova U.S.A.\n8. Trolley Song\n9. Unsquare Dance\n10. Blue Rondo ÃƒÂ  la Turk\n11. Theme from &quot;Mr. Broadway&quot;\n\nEach of the tracks here are excellent examples of the jazz standards that came from the Dave Brubeck Quartet, and reflect the unique time signatures, with superimposing contrasting rhythms, meters, and tonalities that became the signature of this group. Paul Desmond was Brubeck's long-time musical partner going back to the early 1950s, and it was he who wrote the saxophone melody for Quartet's best remembered piece, &quot;Take Five&quot;, which is fittingly the first track of this album. It was written and performed in 5/4 time, and it has endured over time as a true jazz classic on the &quot;Time Out&quot; album. It still ranks as one of the most popular and best-selling jazz albums ever.\n\nBrubeck experimented with time signatures throughout his career, and this can really be heard in &quot;Unsquare Dance&quot; in 7/4, and especially in &quot;Blue Rondo ÃƒÂ  la Turk&quot; in 9/8 and swing 4/4. Another personal favorite on this album is the theme from the television series &quot;Mr. Broadway.&quot; It was a 13-episode CBS series from the mid-1960s that starred Craig Stevens, but the theme as heard here is remembered by many who never saw the ill-fated TV series.\n\nAs far as live performances go, the At Carnegie Hall from 1963 is as critic Richard Palmer put it, &quot;arguably Dave Brubeck's greatest concert.&quot; This listener would agree, as it's another personal favorite that was originally purchased on vinyl.\n\nAt its peak years in the 1960s, the Dave Brubeck Quartet was releasing as many as four albums a year. Brubeck disband the Quartet in late 1967, which gave him more time to compose longer, extended orchestral and choral works that were then occupying his attention, along with his desire to spend more time with his family.\n\nBrubeck continued to play well into his old age, performing in 2010 only a month after getting a pacemaker, and again in 2011. He died of heart failure on his way to a cardiology appointment on December 5, 2012, in Norwalk, Connecticut. It was one day before his 92nd birthday, and a celebration had been planned for him with family and special guests. It has fittingly been recast as a memorial tribute.\n\nThere is not a single mediocre or substandard track on this Dave Brubeck's Greatest Hits album, which is a rarity in itself. For those who have yet to discover his amazing contributions to music in general and jazz in particular, this album is an excellent place to start. And for those of us who have enjoyed his music over the years, this is an excellent tribute to his genius and creativity.[/quote]\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Dave Brubeck - Dave Brubeck's Greatest Hits (CK 65417)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtist...............: Dave Brubeck\nAlbum................: Dave Brubeck's Greatest Hits (CK 65417)\nGenre................: Jazz\nSource...............: CD\nYear.................: 1966\nRipper...............: EAC (Secure mode) / LAME 3.92 &amp; Asus CD-S520\nCodec................: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion..............: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality..............: Lossless, (avg. compression: 58 %)\nChannels.............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
