It's in a full-screen SD 640x480 resolution due to the nature of the source itself. There is a dub-over-raw version floating around (1080p) if would like to grab that instead. \n\n\nVideo: 640x480, x264\nAudio: Stereo AAC-LC\nContainer: MP4\n\nIf it means anything to anyone, you can probably add this to your mobile device and probably any other device capable of playing h264 video without any problem. \n\nAnyway, I usually don't do these types of releases, but the lack of available copies of the Fox dub disturbed me. Feel free to leave any questions and/or comments and I'll try to get back at them. \n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a7fe0aa96c2762bf8392a314163a9c9efbdeb66","amp;dn":"My+Neighbor+Totoro+-+Streamline+-+FOX+English+Dub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a7fe0aa96c2762bf8392a314163a9c9efbdeb66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,127,224,170,150,194,118,43,248,57,42,49,65,99,169,201,239,189,235,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
