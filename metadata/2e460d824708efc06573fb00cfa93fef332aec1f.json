In addition, each audio file has an ID3 tag image of the book's album cover, the proper track number (in relation to all the tracks), and proper title and chapter information.  \n\nThis makes it MUCH easier to enjoy while listening on a smart phone or other mp3 player, go back and re-listen, or keep track of where you left off.  I figured if I'm going to go through the trouble of properly organizing the files, I may as well share it with the world.  I also included the eBook to follow along with.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n=========================================================================================\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\nAmoral, cunning, ruthless, and instructive, this piercing work distills three thousand years of the history of power into 48 well-explicated laws.
