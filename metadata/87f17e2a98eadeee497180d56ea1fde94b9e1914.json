A person's consciousness can now be stored in the brain and downloaded into a new body (or &quot;sleeve&quot;), making death nothing more than a minor blip on a screen. Onetime U.N. Envoy Takeshi Kovacs has been killed before, but his last death was particularly painful. Resleeved into a body in Bay City (formerly San Francisco), Kovacs is thrown into the dark heart of a shady, far-reaching conspiracy that is vicious even by the standards of a society that treats existence as something that can be bought and sold. For Kovacs, the shell that blew a hole in his chest was only the beginning.\r\n\r\n\r\nAltered Carbon\r\nBroken Angels\r\nWoken Furies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87f17e2a98eadeee497180d56ea1fde94b9e1914","amp;dn":"Richard+K.+Morgan+-+Takeshi+Kovacs+%281-3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87f17e2a98eadeee497180d56ea1fde94b9e1914","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,241,126,42,152,234,222,238,73,113,128,213,110,161,253,233,75,158,25,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
