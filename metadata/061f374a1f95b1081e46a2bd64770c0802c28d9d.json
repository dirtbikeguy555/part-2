FOX aired them out of order (like they did with Firefly). To avoid confusion, we labeled the episodes.\n\n--------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:061f374a1f95b1081e46a2bd64770c0802c28d9d","amp;dn":"Wonderfalls+%282004%29+Complete+Series+DVDRip+x264-mMx","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"061f374a1f95b1081e46a2bd64770c0802c28d9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,31,55,74,31,149,177,8,30,70,162,189,100,119,12,8,2,194,141,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
