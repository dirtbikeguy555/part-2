Connectify is an easy-to-use and reliable software router that makes use of your Wi-Fi card to share your Internet connection.\nOn the other hand, Connectify Dispatch will help you quickly and easily combine all your PCs Internet connections for blazing speeds. Dispatch is particularly well-suited for BitTorrent and web pages - any download that naturally involves multiple files.\nWhile monolithic streams like Netflix canÃŽâ€œÃƒâ€¡Ãƒâ€“t be split across connections, Dispatch will assign them to the fastest connection - and route other requests to secondary connections.\n\nWhat's new in Connectify 7.2.0.29636:\n\nDecember 20th, 2013\nNew Features:\nDispatch:\nApplication Settings: The Applications screen (Settings &gt; Applications) has been totally redone, and has become a powerful new tool to both understand and control what your applications are doing with your Internet connections.\nThe window is scalable. If you stretch it wide, it will show you all of the information on each application in separate columns. If the window is narrower, it will show only the most pertinent information.\nEvery application running on your system gets a row in the table. That row turns green whenever it actually accesses the Internet. There are several columns of data: Current Usage, Total Usage and Tracked Connections (open sockets).\nEach application has an Adapter Setting. Selecting this brings up a dialog that lets you select how Dispatch will handle connections from the application:\nSmart Load Balancing:\nDefault Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Uses DispatchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s intelligent load balancing algorithm\nUse Only Adapter:\nPrevious functionality Ã¢â‚¬â€œ assigns the traffic from the application to the specific adapter\nUse Any Adapter Except:\nAllows you to exclude traffic from a specific adapter while still gaining the benefit of load balancing your other adapters\nRound Robin:\nEnsure that each connection from this application ends up on the next available adapter\nLowest Latency:\nUse the adapter with the lowest latency at the time the connection is made Ã¢â‚¬â€œ please note that this will not ensure that another adapter might have lower latency than the one chosen in the future\nDo Not Dispatch:\nUse Windows Default Network as if Dispatch wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t started\nBlocked:\nDo not allow any Internet traffic from this application Ã¢â‚¬â€œ useful for controlling Internet usage\nActions:\nReset Connections: Immediately breaks all of that applicationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s connections (sockets, etc.). This can be useful with applications such a BitTorrent to force them to reopen the sockets when your Internet connections have changed.\nReset Usage: Resets the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Total UsageÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ number to 0, so that tracking starts over.\nHotspot:\nFirewall state of unknown clients Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The default firewall rules from the Settings tab now affect clients prior to them being identified and showing up in the Clients tab as connected clients.\nBug Fixes:\nHotspot:\nProperly load Ã¢â‚¬ËœAlways Show Ad-HocÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ setting on UI start\nWork even when Windows Firewall has been uninstalled completely from the system\nIdentify when Domain Group Policy forbids Connectify\nDispatch:\nFix incoming connections to local servers (RDP fix, uTorrent opened port fix)\nMore logging around Dashboard communication issues\nImprove Dashboard memory usage\nFix interface latency/reliability measurements when WAN connections come and go\n\n\nInstructions:\n&gt;Install the latest version of Connectify\n&gt;Finish the entire installation\n&gt;Now launch Connectify Activator\n&gt;Click Activate PRO button\n&gt;Activator will show a message box saying Connectify successfully activated\n&gt;Wait 1 minute and Launch Connectify\n&gt;Ignore and close Activate Connectify Windows [image]\n&gt;ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s it you are ready to go with Connectify PRO !\n&gt;Launch Dispatch and make sure its PRO too","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3ba4c61d0248c5e7c2f58f4ef1dd697887c83a4","amp;dn":"Connectify+Hotspot+Pro%2BDispatch+Pro+7.2.1.29658+%2B+Crack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3ba4c61d0248c5e7c2f58f4ef1dd697887c83a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,186,76,97,208,36,140,94,124,47,88,244,239,29,214,151,136,124,131,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
