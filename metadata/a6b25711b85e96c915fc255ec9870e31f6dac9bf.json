In Trigger Point Therapy for Myofascial Pain Donna and Steven Finando have organized vast amounts of information on treating myofascial pain into an accessible &quot;user's manual&quot; for healthcare practitioners. They examine a wide range of pain patterns and present evaluation and palpation techniques for reducing trigger points--and thereby alleviating pain--in the most clinically significant musculature of the body. \n\nThis comprehensive yet easy-to-use reference guide to treatment of muscle pain begins with chapters on the concept of Qi and its relationship to myology, specific trigger point location and activation, and palpatory skill-building techniques. Subsequent sections provide detailed information on each muscle to teach clinicians to locate quickly and accurately individual points of pain and compensation. A visual index allows easy identification of the muscles that may be involved. Trigger Point Therapy for Myofascial Pain provides necessary and invaluable information for sufferers and any professional involved with myofascial disorders","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6b25711b85e96c915fc255ec9870e31f6dac9bf","amp;dn":"Trigger+Point+Therapy+for+Myofascial+Pain-+Finando+%5BEpub%5D+%5BStorm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6b25711b85e96c915fc255ec9870e31f6dac9bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,178,87,17,184,94,150,201,21,252,37,94,201,135,14,49,246,218,201,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
