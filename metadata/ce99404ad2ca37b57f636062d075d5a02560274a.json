Based on his own experience and the experiences of others he treated later in his practice, Frankl argues that we cannot avoid suffering but we can choose how to cope with it, find meaning in it, and move forward with renewed purpose.\n\n\ncreated by Yasser Adnan","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce99404ad2ca37b57f636062d075d5a02560274a","amp;dn":"Man%27s+Search+for+Meaning+-+Viktor+Frankl+-+Yasser","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce99404ad2ca37b57f636062d075d5a02560274a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,153,64,74,210,202,55,181,127,99,96,98,208,117,213,160,37,96,39,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
