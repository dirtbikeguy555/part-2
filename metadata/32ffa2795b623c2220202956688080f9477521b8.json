The many favorable responses to prior editions from both students and instructors confirm our belief that clear presentation and comprehensive illustrations are essential to learning the sophisticated topics in an advanced accounting course.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32ffa2795b623c2220202956688080f9477521b8","amp;dn":"Advanced+Financial+Accounting%2C+10E-+Baker+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32ffa2795b623c2220202956688080f9477521b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,255,162,121,91,98,60,34,32,32,41,86,104,128,128,249,71,117,33,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
