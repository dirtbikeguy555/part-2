If you enjoy this band, support them by buying merch, buying tickets to shows or buy their music legitimately somehow one day. Because they're worth it. Trust me. I'm only uploading this because I know not every stoner that loves good music can afford a CD. But if you like them, find a way to pay your dues!\n\n\n\nNamaste.\n\n\n\n\n\nLong live grunge! Long live punk! Long live art!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n - 4122!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c52dd0076fa9ba08e57f57456c1aef3814238f0","amp;dn":"Violent+Soho+-+Hungry+Ghost+%5B2013%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c52dd0076fa9ba08e57f57456c1aef3814238f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,82,221,0,118,250,155,160,142,87,245,116,86,193,174,243,129,66,56,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
