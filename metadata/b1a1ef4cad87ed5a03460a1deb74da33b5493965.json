Covering everything from individual projects to programs and strategic alignment, it addresses:\n\n? Project initiation and planning\n? Communication and interpersonal skills\n? Scheduling, budgeting and meeting business objectives\n? Managing political and resource issues\n? Implementing a PMO\n? Measuring value and competencies.\n\nThe book compiles essays and advice from the field's top professionals and features new chapters on stakeholder management, agile project management, program management, project governance, knowledge management, and more. Updated with fresh examples, case studies and solutions to specific project management dilemmas, it remains an essential reference to the critical concepts and theories all project managers must master.\n\n\n\n\nimage\nScientia est potentia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1a1ef4cad87ed5a03460a1deb74da33b5493965","amp;dn":"The+AMA+Handbook+of+Project+Management%2C+4E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1a1ef4cad87ed5a03460a1deb74da33b5493965","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,161,239,76,173,135,237,90,3,70,10,29,235,116,218,51,181,73,57,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
