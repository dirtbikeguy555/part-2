Start of descend must either be triggered automatically when reaching TOD (A lower FCU altitude than Cruise altitude should be set) or when starting the descend in managed mode by pressing the EXP button. It can also be armed on the PERF APPR page by pressing LSK6L - &quot;ACTIVATE APPROACH PHASE&quot; will then change to &quot;APPROACH PHASE ACTIVATED&quot;. This also happens when changing automatically. Once below 7200 ft AGL speed will be reduced to flap 1 speed setting, extending flaps will reduce speed further until flap 4 where speed is set to Vapp.\n    * DAYTIME LIGHT ARTIFACTS REMOVED\n    * PFD AND ND DISPLAYS NOW REFRESH FASTER\n    * FLIGHT DIRECTOR HEADING CORRECTED\n    * ROLL-OUT MODE INCLUDED\n    * IN MANAGED MODE, THE FMA SHOULD SHOW [SPEED] AND NOT [THR CLB] AFTER REACHING CRUISE LEVEL.\n    * IF &quot;CONF 3&quot; IS CHOOSEN ON PERF APPR PAGE, THEN LANDING CHECKLIST WILL COMMAND FLAPS 3 INSTEAD OF FLAPS FULL\n\n\nKNOWN ISSUES\nThese issues are scheduled to be fixed after the 1.20 release (no guarantee though)\n\n    * VLS is always higher than Vapp, this is not correct\n    * A/SKID switch triggers seat belts sign\n    * Airbus X Connect update\n\n\nKNOWN ISSUES\nThese issues are know but are not easy to solve.\n\n    * ND-range from &quot;20&quot; to &quot;10&quot;, the flight-track gets cut off\n    * Note that the F/O displays do not show all information, this is by design to lighten fps load\n\n\n\nAIRBUS X v1.21 has following changes and is an UPDATE for 1.20 (in the torrent)\n\nTweaks for Autoland.\nTweaks for AP disengagement.\nDisplay update rates changed.\nThrottle FMA's slightly changed.\nScrollable Duplicate waypoint page.\n\nAIRBUS X v1.22 has following changes and is an UPDATE for V1.21 (in the torrent)\n\n+ F12 panel view fixed\n+ RAD/NAV freq/crs entry in the MCDU fixed\n+ Landinglight (aka lightrider bug) fixed\n+ Livery Edelweiss added\n+ Livery Swiss added\n+ Smaller fixes and adjustments\n\n\nThnks and plz seed this and http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6142884/%5BFSX%5D_Aerosoft_Airbus_X_%5BFull_installer_with_crack_and_serial%5D\n\nregards,\nNvidiaPhysX","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:077e0a6b3e7d5afbcf714145bffd8675373d115f","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%5D+Aerosoft+Airbus+X++V1.20%2C+V1.21+and+V1.22+%5BCrack+and+seria","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"077e0a6b3e7d5afbcf714145bffd8675373d115f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,126,10,107,62,125,90,251,207,113,65,69,191,253,134,117,55,61,17,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
