The Undercover Economist is for anyone who's wondered why the gap between rich and poor nations is so great, or why they can't seem to find a decent second-hand car, or how to outwit Starbucks. This book offers the hidden story behind these and other questions, as economist Tim Harford ranges from Africa, Asia, Europe, and of course the United States to reveal how supermarkets, airlines, and coffee chains--to name just a few--are vacuuming money from our wallets. Harford punctures the myths surrounding some of today's biggest controversies, including the high cost of health-care; he reveals why certain environmental laws can put a smile on a landlord's face; and he explains why some industries can have high profits for innocent reasons, while in other industries something sinister is going on. Covering an array of economic concepts including scarce resources, market power, efficiency, price gouging, market failure, inside information, and game theory, Harford sheds light on how these forces shape our day-to-day lives, often without our knowing it. Showing us the world through the eyes of an economist, Tim Harford reveals that everyday events are intricate games of negotiations, contests of strength, and battles of wits. Written with a light touch and sly wit, The Undercover Economist turns &quot;the dismal science&quot; into a true delight. \n\n288 pages \nPublisher: Oxford University Press, USA (November 1, 2005) \nLanguage: English \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78bc0b0a03b52c127a054d6c60a956dce52d414d","amp;dn":"The+Undercover+Economist%3A+Exposing+Why+the+Rich+Are+Rich","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78bc0b0a03b52c127a054d6c60a956dce52d414d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,188,11,10,3,181,44,18,122,5,77,108,96,169,86,220,229,45,65,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
