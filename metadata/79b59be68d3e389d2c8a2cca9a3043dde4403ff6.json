Let's take Albert Ammons - Boogie Woogie Stomp as an obvious example: The main left hand pattern Ammons played in Boogie Woogie Stomp is not the one in the sheet music. Instead, check out the file 'Albert Ammons, Meade Lux Lewis, Pete Johnson - Boogie Woogie Prayer.PDF' (filesize 1.01 MB) - for a more accurate representation of Ammons left hand pattern in Boogie Woogie Stomp.\n\n2) The sheet music represents, more or less, both abbreviated and simplified, versions of the pieces.\n\n3) As a complement when studying the actual recordings, this material can be of good use.\n\n\nThis package consists of sheet music for the following pieces:\n\n01. Albert Ammons - Bass Gone Crazy\n02. Albert Ammons - Boogie Woogie Blues\n03. Albert Ammons - Boogie Woogie Stomp\n04. Albert Ammons - Monday Struggle\n05. Albert Ammons - Swanee River Boogie\n06. Albert Ammons, Meade Lux Lewis, Pete Johnson - Answer To The Prayer\n07. Albert Ammons, Meade Lux Lewis, Pete Johnson - Boogie Woogie Prayer\n08. Clarence 'Pine Top' Smith - Pinetop's Boogie Woogie\n09. Jimmy Yancey, Meade Lux Lewis - Yancey Special\n10. Meade Lux Lewis - 6 Wheel Chaser\n11. Meade Lux Lewis - Bass On Top\n12. Meade Lux Lewis - Bearcat Crawl\n\n--------------------------\n\n\nPS.
