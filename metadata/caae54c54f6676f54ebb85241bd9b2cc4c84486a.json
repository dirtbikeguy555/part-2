At least not in a pack or seeded. Scanned it with avast! and detected no threats, and tested on Windows 7 SP1 x64. \n\nNot much for instructions, just mount or burn the image and install the game. Once installation is finished you will have 3 shortcuts to each of the games respectively, the original took a moment to start for me so just give it time. There is no crack or serial required. \n\nBy the way, I do not take credit for the cracking, I don't know who did it, but kudos to that person for allowing us to play this amazing fps. \n\nAlso the only issue that I experienced was on the original FEAR whenever a checkpoint occurs the game would freeze and go blank for a second before resuming. That could very well be my crappy computer though. I did not experience any issues with the stand alones.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caae54c54f6676f54ebb85241bd9b2cc4c84486a","amp;dn":"FEAR+Platinum+%28Original%2C+Perseus+Mandate%2C+%26+Extraction%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caae54c54f6676f54ebb85241bd9b2cc4c84486a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,174,84,197,79,102,118,245,78,187,133,36,27,217,178,204,76,132,72,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
