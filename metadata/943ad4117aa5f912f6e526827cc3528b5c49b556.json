Finnemore and Joseph Franzini is well known and well respected in the civil engineering market and has a following among civil engineers. This book is for civil engineers that teach fluid mechanics both within their discipline and as a service course to mechanical engineering students. \n\nAs with all previous editions this 10th edition is extraordinarily accurate, and its coverage of open channel flow and transport is superior. There is a broader coverage of all topics in this edition of Fluid Mechanics with Engineering Applications. Furthermore, this edition has numerous computer-related problems that can be solved in Matlab and Mathcad.\n\nThis edition has a printed solutions manual with an increased number of exercises and problems. The 110 figures are added to help present exercises, problems and new sample solutions use Excel, MathCAD and the HP-48G. Web site contains all of the art and photos in the book and provides additional problems for students. Numerous challenging problems can be solved with either computers or programmable calculators.\n\nTable of Contents\n1 Introduction 2 Properties of Fluids 3 Fluid Statics 4 Basics of Fluid Flow 5 Energy in Steady FLow 6 Momentum and Forces in Fluid Flow 7 Similitude and Dimensional Analysis 8 Steady Incompressible Flow in Pressure Conduits 9 Forces on Immersed Bodies 10 Steady Flow in Open Channels 11 Fluid Measurement 12 Unsteady-Flow Problems 13 Steady Flow of Compressible Fluids 14 Ideal Flow Mathematics 15 Hydraulic Machinery - Pumps 16 Hydraulic Machinery - Turbines Appendix A Fluid and Geometric Properties Appendix B Equations in Fluid Mechanics Appendix C Programming and Computer Applications Appendix D Examples of Using Solvers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:943ad4117aa5f912f6e526827cc3528b5c49b556","amp;dn":"Fluid+Mechanics+With+Engineering+Applications+-+10th+Edition.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"943ad4117aa5f912f6e526827cc3528b5c49b556","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,58,212,17,122,165,249,18,246,229,38,130,124,195,82,139,92,73,181,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
