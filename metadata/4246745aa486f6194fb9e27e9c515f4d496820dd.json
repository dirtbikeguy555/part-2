The film was written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. It stars Harriet Andersson, Kari Sylwan, Ingrid Thulin and Liv Ullmann.\n\nUnlike most of Bergman's films, Cries and Whispers uses saturated colour, especially crimson. For his work on this film, Sven Nykvist won the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, and the film was also nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Director, and Best Writing, Story and Screenplay Based on Factual Material or Material Not Previously Published or Produced. Unusually for a foreign language film, it was also nominated for Best Picture, not for Best Foreign Language Film.\n\nAwards and nominations:\n    * Academy Awards\n          o Best Cinematography (Nykvist, won)\n          o Best Picture (nominated)\n          o Best Director (Bergman, nominated)\n          o Best Original Screenplay (Bergman, nominated)\n          o Best Costume Design (Marik Vos-Lundh, nominated)\n    * BAFTA Awards\n          o Best Actress (Thulin, nominated)\n          o Best Cinematography (Nykvist, nominated)\n    * Bodil Awards\n          o Best European Film (Bergman, won)\n    * Cannes Film Festival\n          o Technical Grand Prize (Bergman, won)[1]\n    * Cinema Writers Circle Awards, Spain\n          o Best Foreign Film (won)\n    * David di Donatello Awards\n          o Best Director - Foreign Film (Bergman, won)\n          o Special David (Andersson, Sylwan, Thulin and Ullmann, won)\n    * Golden Globes\n          o Best Foreign-Language Foreign Film (nominated)\n    * Guldbagge Awards\n          o Best Film (won)\n          o Best Actress (Andersson, won)\n    * Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists\n          o Best Director - Foreign Film (Bergman, won)\n    * Jussi Awards\n          o Best Foreign Director (Bergman, won)\n    * Kansas City Film Critics Circle Awards\n          o Best Director (Bergman, won)\n          o Best Foreign Film (won)\n    * National Board of Review\n          o Best Director (Bergman, won)\n          o Best Foreign Language Film (won)\n    * National Society of Film Critics Awards\n          o Best Cinematography (Nykvist, won)\n          o Best Screenplay (Bergman, won)\n    * New York Film Critics Circle Awards\n          o Best Film (won)\n          o Best Director (Bergman, won)\n          o Best Screenplay (Bergman, won)\n          o Best Actress (Ullmann, won, also for The Emigrants)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nVideo Res: 682x480\nframe rate: 23.976\nAR: 1.421\nCodec: Xvid MPEG4 (2-pass Encoding)\nAudio 1: Original Swedish (Stereo MP3)\nAudio 2: Dubbed English (Stereo MP3)\nSubtitle: English SRT","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4246745aa486f6194fb9e27e9c515f4d496820dd","amp;dn":"Cries+and+Whispers+%5BIngmar+Bergman%5D+%5B1972%5D+%5BCriterion%5D+%5BDual+Aud","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4246745aa486f6194fb9e27e9c515f4d496820dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,70,116,90,164,134,246,25,79,185,226,126,156,81,95,77,73,104,32,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
