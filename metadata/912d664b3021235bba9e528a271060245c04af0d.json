How can such sublime work have been produced by a man who seems so ordinary, so opaqueâ€”and occasionally so intemperate? \r\n\r\nJohn Eliot Gardiner grew up passing one of the only two authentic portraits of Bach every day on the stairs of his parentsâ€™ house, where it hung for safety during World War II. He has been studying and performing Bach ever since, and is now regarded as one of the composerâ€™s greatest living interpreters. The fruits of this lifetimeâ€™s immersion are distilled in this remarkable book, grounded in the most recent Bach scholarship but moving far beyond it, and explaining in wonderful detail the ideas on which Bach drew, how he worked, how his music is constructed, how it achieves its effectsâ€”and what it can tell us about Bach the man.\r\n\r\nOne of the Best Books of the Year\r\n* The Economist * The Christian Science Monitor * Financial Times *","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:912d664b3021235bba9e528a271060245c04af0d","amp;dn":"Bach%3A+Music+in+the+Castle+of+Heaven","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"912d664b3021235bba9e528a271060245c04af0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,45,102,75,48,33,35,91,186,158,82,138,39,16,96,36,92,4,175,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
