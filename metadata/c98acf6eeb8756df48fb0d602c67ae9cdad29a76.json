The series centers around a four-year-old Daniel Tiger, son of the original Daniel Striped Tiger. Other characters include Katerina Kittycat, O the Owl, and Prince Wednesday. Two 11-minute episodes are linked by a common socio-emotional theme, such as disappointment, sadness or anger. The theme also uses a Musical Motif phrase to reenforce the theme and help children remember. The series is co-produced by The Fred Rogers Company (formerly Family Communications) and Out of the Blue Enterprises, with animation produced in Canada by 9 Story Entertainment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c98acf6eeb8756df48fb0d602c67ae9cdad29a76","amp;dn":"Daniel+Tiger%27s+Neighborhood+%28PBS+Kids%29+S1%2C+Eps+01-10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c98acf6eeb8756df48fb0d602c67ae9cdad29a76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,138,207,110,235,135,86,223,72,251,13,96,44,103,174,156,218,210,154,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
