That means a lot of people have spent a lot of time anticipating the release of its follow-up High Violet (out May 11th).\n\nFans will be pleased to hear that success hasn't made Matt Berninger any happier over the last couple of years.  Lyrically, songs like &quot;Sorrow&quot; and &quot;Anyone's Ghost&quot; are brimming with hopelessness and despair.  &quot;Runaway&quot; provides the voice of defiance a la Boxer's &quot;Start a War&quot;.  Throughout Berninger's vocals present them with the appropriate level of despondency.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\n01. Terrible Love\n02. Sorrow\n03. AnyoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Ghost\n04. Little Faith\n05. Afraid of Everyone\n06. Bloodbuzz Ohio\n07. Lemonworld\n08. Runaway\n09. Conversation 16\n10. England\n11. Vanderlyle Crybaby Geeks\n\nThe bulk of the arrangements will be familiar.  Songs like the triumphant &quot;England&quot; are lush and very deliberately structured.  The Dessner brothers guitars are supplemented by a wide array of supporting instruments, including piano and the now requisite strings. \n\nThere are a handful of instances, such as on the smoldering opener &quot;Terrible Love&quot;, when the band does venture into a more dissonant sound.  At times they even seem to flirt with chaos, always halting just before the song completely collapses in on itself.\n\nThe trademark National intensity is on full display on &quot;Ohio Bloodbuzz&quot;.  It's there on &quot;Afraid of Everyone&quot; too, a track that's vintage National with a twist.  The slow build is layered with fetching backing vocals by Marla Hansen, that carry you to the brink of the abyss before abandoning you there, seeking closure.  Elsewhere on the record, backing vocals are provide by The Arcade Fire's Richard Reed Perry, Justin Vernon of Bon Iver, and Sufjan Stevens.\n\nMuch like its predecessor it takes a while to immerse yourself in High Violet.  It's worth the effort though, as the payoff is tremendous when you finally come to fully appreciate the album.\n\nThe National play Massey Hall in Toronto on June 8th &amp; 9th.\n\nBest tracks: &quot;Lemonworld&quot;, &quot;England&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62957fef2cf1e8865c99a0b1df5f9303cccb8eeb","amp;dn":"The+National+-+High+Violet+%5B2010%5D+%5B320kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62957fef2cf1e8865c99a0b1df5f9303cccb8eeb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,149,127,239,44,241,232,134,92,153,160,177,223,95,147,3,204,203,142,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
