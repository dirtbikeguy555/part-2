Determined to remain in charge, Kane conceals the disease from everyone around him except his own physician, Dr. Ella Harris. Kane's marriage to Meredith is one of convenience. His closest advisors, Kitty O'Neill and Ezra Stone, begin to suspect something is wrong with the Mayor but respect the boundary he has erected that precludes asking such questions, though lapses on Kane's part begin to become apparent to others around him, such as the current Illinois governor McCall &quot;Mac&quot; Cullen and The Sentinel's political journalist Sam Miller. Meanwhile, Kane and his team work behind the scenes to groom State Treasurer Ben Zajac to become the next Governor of Illinois.\r\n\r\n\r\n_____________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nName (Title): BOSS - Complete TV Series (Season 01 &amp; 02) - 720p HDTV x264\r\n\r\nCategory Type: TV Series (Shows)\r\n\r\nLength (Duration): 60-minutes\r\n\r\nYear(s): 2011-2012\r\n\r\nStarring: Kelsey Grammar, Connie Nielsen, Jeff Hephner, Hannah Ware, Kathleen Robertson, Rotimi\r\n\r\nGenre(s): Political Drama, Crime, Thriller\r\n\r\nResolution: 720p\r\n\r\nRip Type (Source): HDTV\r\n\r\nCodec Type: x264\r\n\r\nFormat of File(s): MP4\r\n\r\nAudio Format &amp; Language(s): AC3 5.1 6-Channel (English)\r\n\r\nSubtitles: No.\r\n\r\nChapters: No.\r\n\r\nIMDB Link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1833285/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1baeca547e1ee16aa065df11da45861f271e1212","amp;dn":"BOSS+-+Complete+TV+Series+%28Season+01+%26amp%3B+02%29+-+720p+HDTV+x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1baeca547e1ee16aa065df11da45861f271e1212","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,174,202,84,126,30,225,106,160,101,223,17,218,69,134,31,39,30,18,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
