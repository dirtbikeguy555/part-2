Cyber attacks are increasingly targeting the core functions of the economies in nations throughout the world. The threat to attack critical infrastructures, disrupt critical services, and induce a wide range of damage is becoming more difficult to defend against. Cybersecurity: Protecting Critical Infrastructures from Cyber Attack and Cyber Warfare examines the current cyber threat landscape and discusses the strategies being used by governments and corporations to protect against these threats.\r\n\r\nThe book first provides a historical reference, detailing the emergence of viruses, worms, malware, and other cyber threats that created the need for the cybersecurity field. It then discusses the vulnerabilities of our critical infrastructures, the broad arsenal of cyber attack tools, and the various engineering design issues involved in protecting our infrastructures. It goes on to cover cyber intelligence tactics, recent examples of cyber conflict and warfare, and the key issues in formulating a national strategy to defend against cyber warfare.\r\n\r\nThe book also discusses how to assess and measure the cost of cybersecurity. It examines the many associated cost factors and presents the results of several important industry-based economic studies of security breaches that have occurred within many nations. The book concludes with a look at future trends in cybersecurity. It discusses the potential impact of industry-wide transformational changes, such as virtualization, social media, cloud computing, structured and unstructured data, big data, and data analytics","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11d41b43cc67bc35ad9328bbe66de62d3301e76c","amp;dn":"Cybersecurity+%282015%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11d41b43cc67bc35ad9328bbe66de62d3301e76c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,212,27,67,204,103,188,53,173,147,40,187,230,109,230,45,51,1,231,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
