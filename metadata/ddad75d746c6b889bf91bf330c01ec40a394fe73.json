Harkness\nViking | 2014 | ISBN: 0670025593 | 576 pages | EPUB | 3 MB\n\nThe highly anticipated finale to the #1 New York Times bestselling trilogy that began with A Discovery of Witches\n\nAfter traveling through time in Shadow of Night, the second book in Deborah HarknessÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enchanting series, historian and witch Diana Bishop and vampire scientist Matthew Clairmont return to the present to face new crises and old enemies. At MatthewÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ancestral home at Sept-Tours, they reunite with the cast of characters from A Discovery of WitchesÃ¢â‚¬â€with one significant exception. But the real threat to their future has yet to be revealed, and when it is, the search for Ashmole 782 and its missing pages takes on even more urgency. In the trilogyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s final volume, Harkness deepens her themes of power and passion, family and caring, past deeds and their present consequences. In ancestral homes and university laboratories, using ancient knowledge and modern science, from the hills of the Auvergne to the palaces of Venice and beyond, the couple at last learn what the witches discovered so many centuries ago.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddad75d746c6b889bf91bf330c01ec40a394fe73","amp;dn":"The+Book+of+Life+by+Deborah+E.+Harkness","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddad75d746c6b889bf91bf330c01ec40a394fe73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,173,117,215,70,198,184,137,191,145,191,51,12,1,236,64,163,148,254,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
