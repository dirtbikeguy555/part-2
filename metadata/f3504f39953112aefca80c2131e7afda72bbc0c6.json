module.\n\nAuthored by: Paul O'Fallon \nDuration: 2h 48m\nLevel: Intermediate\nReleased: 12/20/2012\n\nVideo Details:\nGetting Started with Node.js\t\t\t0:36:14\nIntroduction\t\t\t\t\t0:38\nNode.js Background\t\t\t\t1:51\nGetting Node.js\t\t\t\t\t1:31\nDemo Installing Node on Linux with NVM\t\t6:55\nDemo Developing for Node with Cloud9 IDE\t7:41\nNodes Event Loop\t\t\t\t2:51\nNode Conventions for Writing Asychronous Code\t4:45\nDemo Writing Asychronous Code in Node.js\t8:18\nThe Christmas Tree Problem Conclusion\t\t1:44\n\nModules, require() and NPM\t\t\t0:17:43\nIntroduction Accessing Built-in Modules\t\t2:42\nDemo Accessing Built-in Modules\t\t\t1:42\nUsing require to Modularize Your Application\t2:22\nDemo Accessing Application Files with require\t3:00\nFinding 3rd Party Modules via NPM\t\t2:17\nDemo Installing and Using 3rd Party Modules\t3:07\nPublishing Your Own Module Conclusion\t\t2:33\n\nEvents and Streams\t\t\t\t0:26:35\nIntroduction\t\t\t\t\t0:34\nEvents and the EventEmitter class\t\t4:41\nDemo Returning an EventEmitter from a function\t3:39\nDemo Inheriting from EventEmitter\t\t3:23\nReadable and Writable Streams the Pipe function\t3:30\nDemo Readable and Writable Streams\t\t3:21\nDemo Piping Between Streams\t\t\t6:54\nConclusion\t\t\t\t\t0:33\n\nAccessing the Local System\t\t\t0:17:20\nIntroduction The Process Object\t\t\t2:17\nDemo The Process object\t\t\t\t5:21\nInteracting with the File System\t\t1:07\nDemo Interacting with the File System\t\t3:59\nWhat is a Buffer\t\t\t\t1:04\nDemo Buffers\t\t\t\t\t2:17\nThe OS Module Conclusion\t\t\t1:15\n\nInteracting with the Web\t\t\t0:21:40\nIntroduction Making Web Requests in Node\t2:36\nDemo Making Web Requests in Node\t\t4:01\nBuilding a Web Server in Node\t\t\t1:58\nDemo Building a Web Server in Node\t\t3:00\nRealtime Interaction with Socket.IO\t\t2:38\nDemo Socket.IO\t\t\t\t\t6:38\nConclusion\t\t\t\t\t0:49\n\nTesting and Debugging\t\t\t\t0:27:38\nIntroduction The Assert Module\t\t\t2:33\nDemo The Assert Module\t\t\t\t4:18\nTesting with Mocha and Should.js\t\t3:36\nDemo Mocha and Should.js\t\t\t9:14\nDebugging with the Cloud9 IDE\t\t\t1:17\nDemo Debugging with the Cloud9 IDE and Chrome\t5:40\nConclusion\t\t\t\t\t1:00\n\nScaling Your Node Application\t\t\t0:20:57\nIntroduction The Child Process Module\t\t4:11\nDemo The exec function\t\t\t\t2:26\nDemo The spawn function\t\t\t\t2:01\nDemo The fork function\t\t\t\t2:51\nScaling with Nodes Cluster Module\t\t2:35\nDemo Building a Clustered Web Server\t\t6:25\nConclusion\t\t\t\t\t0:28\n\nIf you enjoy the video tutorial please support the author(s) by subscribing to pluralsight. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pluralsight.com/&quot;
