The band formed originally under the name &quot;Paris&quot; but later changed it to &quot;PVRIS&quot; in the summer of 2013 citing legal reasons. However it is still pronounced &quot;Paris&quot;, and the &quot;V&quot; acts as an upside down &quot;A&quot;. They have released a self-titled EP and an acoustic EP. - Wikipedia\n\n\n\nT R A C K   L I S T I N G :\n\n01. Waking Up (Acoustic)\n02. Demon Limbs (Acoustic)\n03. Mind Over Matter (Acoustic)\n04.
