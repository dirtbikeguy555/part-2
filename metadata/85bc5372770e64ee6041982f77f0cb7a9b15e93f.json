The recordings consist of both live concert performances and outtakes from studio sessions conducted by the band. Many hundreds of Led Zeppelin bootlegs exist, and are widely collected by fans.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlant sings &quot;gimme some more monitors, if you will, yeah&quot; during the initial verses of Since I've Been Loving You. He unleashes a spine-chilling squeal at the end of Page's uneven guitar solo. No Quarter is hauntingly epic. An excellent performance. \r\n\r\nPlant mentions &quot;a funny feelin' in me pipe&quot; while introducing The Song Remains the Same. Page's fingers fly across the fretboard during the guitar solos. The Rain Song is fantastic. Bonzo pounds on his drums with incredible intensity during the heavy section. Unfortunately, there is a slight cut in the tape near the end of the song\r\n\r\nDate : 19/05/1973\r\n\r\nWhere : Tarrant County Convention Center, Fort Worth, Texas\r\n\r\nSupport : 2 cd\r\n\r\nTime : 102:37 mn\r\n\r\nSource : Soundboard (cassette)\r\n\r\n1-1\tRock And Roll \t\r\n1-2 \tCelebration Day \t\r\n1-3 \tBring It On Home / Black Dog \t\r\n1-4 \tOver The Hills And Far Away \t\r\n1-5 \tMisty Mountain Hop \t\r\n1-6 \tSince I've Been Loving You \t\r\n1-7 \tNo Quarter \t\r\n1-8 \tThe Song Remains The Same \t\r\n1-9 \tThe Rain Song \t\r\n2-1 \tDazed And Confused \t\r\n2-2 \tStairway To Heaven\r\n\r\n\r\nPlayers:\r\n\r\nRobert Plant \r\nJimmy Page\r\nJohn Bonham\r\nJohn Paul Jones\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a problem wth the 320ak share and it will return, but here's the FLAC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85bc5372770e64ee6041982f77f0cb7a9b15e93f","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+Fort+Worth%2C+Texas+2016+flac+ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85bc5372770e64ee6041982f77f0cb7a9b15e93f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,188,83,114,119,14,100,238,96,65,152,47,119,240,203,122,155,21,233,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
