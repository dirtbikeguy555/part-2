The park manager is the hired gun of a financial syndicate that wants to develop the property, and he's prepared to do whatever it takes - but he can't figure out what to do about the teenage girl, the one the laborers believe has some sort of gift.\r\n\r\nWhen she witnesses him killing a man, though, and runs, there's nothing left to figure: He's got to find her fast and shut her up good. Her only hope for survival: a marine biologist (and sometimes more) named Doc Ford, who along with his friend Tomlinson, must undertake a search through an underground, invisible nation... and just hope he reaches her first","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5231a8bf894b358125f5754c53dc795532295a1b","amp;dn":"NIGHT+VISION+-+Randy+Wayne+White.+George+Guidall+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5231a8bf894b358125f5754c53dc795532295a1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,49,168,191,137,75,53,129,37,245,117,76,83,220,121,85,50,41,90,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
