You navigate a procedural landscape that changes every day. You find and collect speed boosts to go even faster and momentarily reverse time. The goal is to increase your score and survive as long as you can without running out of daylight or smashing into pieces. For a change of pace, team-up with other players in an asynchronous relay race.\n\nThe Simplex World Creator is included right in the game and allows anyone to make unique new game modes (or modify existing ones) and share them in a special user worlds screen for all to see. The game also includes an extremely difficult world called Apocalypse and a deep player leveling system - with tons of objectives and 25 player levels to unlock. As you unlock items, you can customize your ship with attachments like faster turning, protective shield, and decals.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/3f99e248549f08786754b5fae0ff849a12f22ced.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://image.bayimg.com/3f99e248549f08786754b5fae0ff849a12f22ced.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nInstall and Play.\n\nOther:\nGenre:........................................racing / arcade / sci-fi\nDownload size:...........................24 MB\nRelease date:.............................August 18, 2013\nCompatible with:........................Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8)\nLanguages:................................English\nDeveloper / Publisher:................Flippfly\nGame modes:.............................single-player, multi-player, co-op\nMultiplayer notice: In order to access the multiplayer you must first enter your unique cd-key that can be found under My Account.
