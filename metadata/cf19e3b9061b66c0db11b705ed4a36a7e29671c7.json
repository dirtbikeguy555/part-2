Influenced by Eastern philosophy, he maintained that the &quot;truth was recognized by the sages of India&quot;; consequently, his solutions to suffering were similar to those of Vedantic and Buddhist thinkers (i.e., asceticism).  His faith in &quot;transcendental ideality&quot; led him to accept atheism.\n\nHis work influenced many thinkers, including Friedrich Nietzsche, Richard Wagner, Otto Weininger, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Erwin SchrÃƒÂ¶dinger, Albert Einstein, Sigmund Freud, Otto Rank, Carl Gustav Jung, Joseph Campbell, Leo Tolstoy, Thomas Mann, Jorge Luis Borges, and Mustafa Mahmud, among others.\n\n\nThis collection includes two translations of THE WORLD AS WILL AND REPRESENTATION and several editions of his philosophical essays, in a mix of ePUB and/or PDF formats as indicated:\n\n* THE COLLECTED ESSAYS OF ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER (Halcyon Press, 2010). -- ePUB\n\n* THE ESSAYS OF ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER, 8 vols.
