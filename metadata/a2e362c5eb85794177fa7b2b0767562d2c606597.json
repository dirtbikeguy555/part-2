He is convinced he is the epitome of urban cool, and therefore secretly terrified he might not be, which is why he reads Sugar Ape magazine, his bible of cool. Sugar Ape has been described as a spoof of Dazed &amp; Confused and Vice, although Brooker has stated that &quot;the SugarApe Vice issue from Ep5 wasn't an assault on Vice magazine - I think it just understandably ended up looking that way.\n\nThe website consists of stupid pranks caught on camera, photos of him with attractive women and famous figures (some of them digitally edited to insert himself), and photos of him standing on street corners in major cities around the world.\n\nThe humour derives from the rapid rise of both the Internet and digital television, and the assumption by publishers and broadcasters that almost any such work is worthy of attention. Barley and his peers are often hired ahead of actual journalists and talented writers trying to make intelligent points, such as the earnest documentary film maker Claire Ashcroft, and her brother Dan Ashcroft, a jaded, opinionated and apathetic hack who, having written an article for Sugar Ape entitled - The Rise of the Idiots, is appalled to find that the idiots in question Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Nathan and his contemporaries - have adopted him as their spiritual leader, failing to see that they are the very people he was criticising.\n\nNicholas Burns Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Nathan Barley\nJulian Barratt Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Dan Ashcroft\nClaire Keelan Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Claire Ashcroft\nBen Whishaw Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Pingu\nNoel Fielding Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jones\nRichard Ayoade Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ned Smanks\nSpencer Brown Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Rufus Onslatt\nCharlie Condou Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jonatton Yeah?\nDavid Hoyle Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Doug Rocket\nNina Sosanya Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sasha\nRhys Thomas Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Toby\nKevin Eldon - Nikolai the Barber\nJulia Davis - Honda Poppet\n\nComplete 6 episode season\n640x352 &amp; 704x400\n\nExtras \n720x416\n...
