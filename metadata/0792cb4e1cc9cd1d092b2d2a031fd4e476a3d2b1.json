A remarkable writing debut, filled with indelible moments, The Buy Side shows as no book ever has the rewards Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and dizzying temptations Ã¢â‚¬â€œ of making a living on the Street.\n\nGrowing up in the 1980Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Turney Duff was your average kid from Kennebunk, Maine, eager to expand his horizons. After trying Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and failing Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to land a job as a journalist, he secured a trainee position at Morgan Stanley and got his first feel for the pecking order that exists in the trading pits. Those on the Ã¢â‚¬Å“buy side,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the traders who make large bets on whether a stock will rise or fall, are the Ã¢â‚¬Å“alphasÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and those on the Ã¢â‚¬Å“sell side,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the brokers who handle their business, are eager to please.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0792cb4e1cc9cd1d092b2d2a031fd4e476a3d2b1","amp;dn":"+The+Buy+Side%3A+A+Wall+Street+Trader%27s+Tale+of+Spectacular+Excess","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0792cb4e1cc9cd1d092b2d2a031fd4e476a3d2b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,146,203,78,28,201,205,29,9,43,45,42,3,31,212,228,118,163,210,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
