Season 5 was never dubbed in English so it's the original Japanese version with English subs. This season also has translation facts inserted in a few spots in some of the episodes.\n\nThere are 191 episodes in all and are numbered sequentially from 1 to 191, so the episodes won't match lists showing the missing Japanese episodes. I started episodes 1-9 with a 00 in front and episodes 10-99 with a 0 in front so they'll line up with all the episodes 100 and over.\n\nAll three movies are included as well with English dubs, put in their respective season folders.\n\nEvery video is in MKV format.\n\n1x001 -
