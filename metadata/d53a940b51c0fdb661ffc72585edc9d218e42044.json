Christian takes a unique synoptic approach that will both engage and visually captivate you as the book focuses on the big picture and the interdisciplinary origins of philosophical thinking. This edition's fascinating presentation is interwoven with cartoons, quotations, and related findings from the social and physical sciences that ensure central philosophical concepts are accessible. An eclectic range of topics reinforces the author's presentation of philosophy as the individual's attempt to unify disparate world views. Interspersed biographies provide glimpses into the lives of great thinkers who have molded the Western philosophical tradition and largely influenced how society thinks today.
