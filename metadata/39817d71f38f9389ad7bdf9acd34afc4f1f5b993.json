After graduating in electronic engineering in his native Ireland he spent six months in Spain struggling to learn Spanish. This frustrating experience fuelled his determination to take a different approach to learning foreign languages.\n\nToday he speaks over ten languages including Mandarin Chinese, Arabic, French, German, Portuguese, and Hungarian. At present, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s learning Japanese in Spain. This typifies one of his Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ3-month challengesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ where he targets a new language and proceeds to become fluent in it within just three months. He charts his progress on his blog, proving that his techniques allow anyone to learn a language from anywhere.\n\nBennyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blog, also called Fluent in 3 Months, is the largest language learning blog in the world.\n\nThe key principles of BennyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s method:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Speak from day one: find mother-tongue speaking partners online. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be self-conscious Ã¢â‚¬â€œ keep the flow going!\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Change your mindset: ditch the excuses, you can do it!\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Stay focused and determined: even if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have much time, never forget the goal youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve set yourself and work at it.\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Learning a language doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t need to be expensive: there is a wealth of free resources out there, if you know where to find them\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Reap the rewards! Learning a new language is not an end in itself, but a means to meeting new people and discovering new cultures. Curiosity will fuel your determination.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39817d71f38f9389ad7bdf9acd34afc4f1f5b993","amp;dn":"Fluent+in+3+Months+-+Benny+Lewis+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39817d71f38f9389ad7bdf9acd34afc4f1f5b993","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,129,125,113,243,143,147,137,173,123,223,154,205,52,175,196,241,245,185,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
