Mescaline is the principal agent of the psychedelic cactus peyote, which has been used in American religious ceremonies for thousands of years.[1]\n\nThe title comes from William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell:\n\n    &quot;If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things through narrow chinks of his cavern.&quot;\n\nThe book takes the form of HuxleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s recollection of a mescaline trip which took place over the course of an afternoon. Huxley recalls the insights he experienced, which range from the &quot;purely aesthetic&quot; to &quot;sacramental vision&quot;, he also incorporates later reflections on the experience and its meaning for art and religion. \n\nSynopsis\n\nAfter a brief overview of research into mescaline, Huxley recounts that he was given 4/10 of a gram at 11.00 am one day in May 1953. Huxley writes that he hoped to gain insight into extraordinary states of mind and expected to see brightly-colored visionary landscapes. When he only sees lights and shapes, he puts this down to being a bad visualiser, however, he experiences a great change in the external world.\n\nBy 12.30, a vase of flowers becomes the &quot;miracle, moment by moment, of naked existence&quot;. The experience, he asserts, is neither agreeable nor disagreeable, but simply &quot;is&quot;. He likens it to Meister EckhartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“istigheitÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“is-nessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, and PlatoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“BeingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ but not separated from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“BecomingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. He feels he understands the Hindu concept of Satchitananda, as well as the Zen koan that ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“the dharma body of the Buddha is in the hedgeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and Buddhist suchness. In this state, Huxley explains he didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have an ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, but instead a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“not-IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. Meaning and existence, pattern and colour become more significant than spatial relationships and time. Duration is replaced by a perpetual present.\n\nReflecting on the experience afterwards, Huxley finds himself in agreement with philosopher C.D. Broad that to enable us to live, the brain and nervous system eliminates unessential information from the totality of the Mind at Large.\n\nIn summary, Huxley writes that the ability to think straight is not reduced on mescaline, visual impressions are intensified, and the human will see no reason for action because the experience is so fascinating.\n\nTemporarily leaving the chronological flow, he mentions that four or five hours into the experience he was taken to the WorldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Biggest Drug Store (WBDS) where he was presented with books on art. In one book, the dress in BotticelliÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Judith provokes a reflection on drapery as a major artistic theme as it allows painters to include the abstract in representational art, to create mood, and also to represent the mystery of pure being. Huxley feels that human affairs are somewhat irrelevant whilst on mescaline and attempts to shed light on this by reflecting on paintings featuring people. CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©zanneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Self portrait with a straw hat seems to him as incredibly pretentious, while VermeerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s human still lives (also, the Le Nain Brothers and Vuillard) are the nearest to reflecting this not-self state.\n\nFor Huxley, the reconciliation of these cleansed perceptions with humanity reflects the age old debate between active and contemplative life, known as the way of Martha and the way of Mary. As Huxley believes that contemplation should also include action and charity, he concludes that the experience represents contemplation at its height, but not its fullness. Correct behaviour and alertness are needed. Nonetheless, Huxley maintains that even quietistic contemplation has an ethical value, because it is concerned with negative virtues and acts to channel the transcendent into the world.\n\nAfter listening to MozartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s C- Minor Piano Concerto, GesualdoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s madrigals and Alban BergÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Lyric Suite, Huxley heads into the garden. Outside, the garden chairs take on such an immense intensity that he fears being overwhelmed; this gives him an insight into madness. He reflects that spiritual literature, including the works of Jacob Boehme, William Law and the Tibetan Book of the Dead, talk of these pains and terrors. Huxley speculates that schizophrenia is the inability to escape from this reality into the world of common sense and thus help would be essential.\n\nAfter lunch and the drive to the WBDS he returns home and to his ordinary state of mind. His final insight is taken from Buddhist scripture: that within sameness there is difference, although that difference is not different from sameness.\n\nThe book finishes with HuxleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s final reflections on the meaning of his experience. Firstly, the urge to transcend oneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s self is universal through times and cultures (and was characterized by H.G. Wells as The Door in the Wall). He reasons that better, healthier ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“doorsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ are needed than alcohol and tobacco. Mescaline has the advantage of not provoking violence in takers, but its effects last an inconveniently long time and some users can have negative reactions. Ideally, self-transcendence would be found in religion, but Huxley feels that it is unlikely that this will ever happen. Christianity and mescaline seem well-suited; the Native American Church for instance uses the drug, where its use combines religious feeling with decorum.\n\nHuxley concludes that mescaline is not enlightenment or the Beatific Vision, but a 'gratuitous grace' (a term taken from St Thomas AquinasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Summa Theologica). It is not necessary but helpful, especially so for the intellectual, who can become the victim of words and symbols. Although systematic reasoning is important, direct perception has intrinsic value too. Finally, Huxley maintains that the person who has this experience will be transformed for the better.\n\n-Wikipedia","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e76a7cc948d312aae4d35d1e84f8e71d2029c397","amp;dn":"The+Doors+Of+Perception+-+Aldous+Huxley+%5BPDF%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e76a7cc948d312aae4d35d1e84f8e71d2029c397","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,106,124,201,72,211,18,170,228,211,93,30,132,248,231,29,32,41,195,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
