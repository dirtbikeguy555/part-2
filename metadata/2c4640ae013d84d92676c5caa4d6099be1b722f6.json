All the newest stuff can't really sound \nimproved because it's pretty much already got a perfect sound.\nIn my opinion this album has a great sound to it and\nbeing the great band that Aerosmith are, it makes ir perfect.  10\n\n\n\nLyrics and Singing:\n\nObdviously being Steve Tyler, the lyrics are always incredible. \nAnd being an album which has all their best hits, \nall the songs have great lyrics. There is not much more I can say \nabout the lyrics because there are no songs which aren't featured\non other albums. But yeah the lyrics on this album are great. 10\n\n\nImpression:\n\nThis album is great! It has all the best Aerosmith songs on one album, \nfrom their very first songs e.g. Dream On, Mama Kin and Same \nOld Song And Dance, To there new stuff e.g. Just Push Play and Jaded.\nThe good thing about this album is the fact that it has all the famous Aerosmith\ntracks plus a few more that weren't as famous but are still great songs. \nUsually I tend to find with 'greatest hits' albums is that they sometimes \nhave songs from random albums just picked out to fill the CD, this CD \nhowever doesn't do that and I think Aerosmith probably have no problems \nbecause all of their tracks are great and most of them famous, so they don't have to \nfill the gaps with random songs. As you can see I have rated this album\n10 for my overall impression and this is because if your a true \nAerosmith fan, you can never have enough of their hits and this album \nhas pretty much all of them! A must have for Aerosmith fans.  10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c4640ae013d84d92676c5caa4d6099be1b722f6","amp;dn":"Aerosmith+O%2C+Yeah%21+Ultimate+Aerosmith+Hits+%26+Art+320+Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c4640ae013d84d92676c5caa4d6099be1b722f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,70,64,174,1,61,132,217,38,118,197,202,164,214,9,155,225,183,34,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
