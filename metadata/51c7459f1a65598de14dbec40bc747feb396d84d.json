The single releases (and subsequent compilation releases) use a remix which was created for the single using modern production, which sounds very different.\n\n&quot;Why Should I&quot; was remixed for this compilation and released as a single. The original wasn't released until the JAD/Universal box set Man To Man in 2004. The original was recorded in 1971 and features Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer's backing vocals, which were replaced by The I-Threes on the remix.\n\nIt is said to be complimentary to the greatest hits compilation Legend, in the sense that any of the tracks with the same names are presented in different versions from the normal single mixes on Legend - as an example see the number of 12&quot; mixes in the track listing below. The exception is the original version of Get Up Stand Up.\n\nTRACK LISTING [320k MP3] \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_of_Freedom#Track_listing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_of_Freedom#Track_listing&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51c7459f1a65598de14dbec40bc747feb396d84d","amp;dn":"Bob+Marley+-+Songs+Of+Freedom+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51c7459f1a65598de14dbec40bc747feb396d84d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,199,69,159,26,101,89,141,225,77,190,196,11,199,71,254,179,150,216,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
