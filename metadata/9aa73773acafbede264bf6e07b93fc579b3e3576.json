This book focuses on networks and real attacks, offers extensive coverage of offensive and defensive techniques, and is supported by a rich collection of exercises and resources.\r\n\r\nYou'll learn how to configure your network from the ground up, starting by setting up your virtual test environment with basics like DNS and active directory, through common network services, and ending with complex web applications involving web servers and backend databases.\r\n\r\nKey defensive techniques are integrated throughout the exposition. You will develop situational awareness of your network and will build a complete defensive infrastructureâ€”including log servers, network firewalls, web application firewalls, and intrusion detection systems.\r\n\r\nOf course, you cannot truly understand how to defend a network if you do not know how to attack it, so you will attack your test systems in a variety of ways beginning with elementary attacks against browsers through privilege escalation to a domain administrator, or attacks against simple network servers through the compromise of a defended e-commerce site.\r\n\r\nThe author, who has coached his universityâ€™s cyber defense team three times to the finals of the National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition, provides a practical, hands-on approach to cyber security.\r\n\r\nWhat youâ€™ll learn:\r\n\r\nHow to securely set up a complete network, from its infrastructure through web applications\r\nHow to integrate defensive technologies such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems into your network\r\nHow to attack your network with tools like Kali Linux, Metasploit, and Burp Suite\r\nHow to gain situational awareness on your network to detect and prevent such attacks\r\n\r\nWho this book is for:\r\n\r\nThis book is for beginning and intermediate professionals in cyber security who want to learn more about building, defending, and attacking computer networks. It is also suitable for use as a textbook and supplementary text for hands-on courses in cyber operations at the undergraduate and graduate level.\r\n\r\nTable of Contents:\r\n\r\nChapter 1.
