JobeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s breathy, vulnerable vocals often recall the waif-like tones of Leigh Nash, though she's also capable of dramatic flourishes at key moments. Under the sure guidance of veteran Christian music producers Ed Cash and Matt Bronleewe, Where I Find You mixes simmering electronica settings (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Stars in the Sky,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Run to YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) with piano-centered pop balladry (Ã¢â‚¬Å“What Love Is This,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Love Came DownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and rousing upbeat anthems (Ã¢â‚¬Å“We AreÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). Jobe is at her best when she rises from fragile verses into stirring choruses, as on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Find You on My Knees.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Throughout, she displays an ability to deliver messages of praise in personal terms without losing their universality. The closing track, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Here&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€œa heartfelt invitation to accept ChristÃ¢â‚¬â€œsums up the album's sweet yet strong essence.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01.
