Most Stones fans consider this to be a vastly inferior album due to meddling by the record execs. At this time it was common for the execs to make decisions on what they thought would sell to the &quot;American&quot; market, which usually translated into holding back releases in order to create new packages to increase sales before the band faded into obscurity.\nThis American version replaced Mothers Little Helper with what was at that time a recent hit - Paint It, Black, while cutting Out Of Time, Take It Or Leave It, and What To Do.\n\nNearly everyone knows this music and now you can enjoy it the way it was meant to be heard. For the music itself, it's hard to improve on the review done of the UK Aftermath release by Brian Christie on Aug 29, 2002.\n\nABCKO acquired the Stones' catalog when Allen Klein became their manager in the 70s. The resulting legal battles produced releases that the Stones opposed (they took out full page adds asking fans not to buy them), including the controversial Metamorphosis releases (which are now available on CD for the 1st time ever). But the sad fact is that the Stones lost control of their great early material. With the recently remastered SACD releases, we at last have some idea of what they really sounded like in the studio. I guess if we had them 40 years ago they would have ended up Greatest Rock And Roll Band in the Universe instead of just our tiny little World.\n\nAll the tracks for Aftermath were recorded during 2 sessions at RCA Studios in Hollywood.\n\nDec 3-8, 1965 at RCA Studios in Hollywood\n.....Doncha Bother Me (originally titled Don't You Follow Me for the unreleased album Could You Walk On The Water)\n.....Goin' Home\n.....Think\nMar 6-9, 1966 at RCA Studios in Hollywood\n.....Paint It, Black\n.....Stupid Girl\n.....Lady Jane\n.....Under My Thumb\n.....Flight 505\n.....High And Dry\n.....It's Not Easy\n.....I Am Waiting\n\nThe tracks recorded during these sessions that were not released on the UK version were Mother's Little Helper, Sittin' On A Fence, Sad Day, 19th Nervous Breakdown, Ride On Baby, Long Long While, Take It Or Leave It, What To Do, and both version 1 - the long version - and version 2 - the short version - of Out Of Time. In addition there were 3 tracks that have still never been released: Looking Tired, Aftermath, and Tracks Of My Tears.\n\nThis information comes from &quot;It's Only Rock And Roll: The Ultimate Guide To The Rolling Stones&quot; by Karnbach and Bernson and from my own collection. \n\nby Richard R.
