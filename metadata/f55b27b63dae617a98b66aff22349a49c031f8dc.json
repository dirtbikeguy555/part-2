The incredible, illustrated volume reveals why longitude mattered to seafaring nations, illuminates the various solutions that were proposed and tested, and explores the invention that revolutionized human history and the man behind it, John Harrison. Here, too, are the voyages of Captain Cook that put these revolutionary navigational methods to the test.\r\n\r\nFilled with astronomers, inventors, politicians, seamen, and satirists, Ships, Clocks, and Stars explores the scientific, political, and commercial battles of the age, as well as the sailors, ships, and voyages that made it legendâ€”from Matthew Flinders and George Vancouver to the voyages of the Bounty and the Beagle.\r\n\r\nFeaturing more than 150 photographs specially commissioned from Britainâ€™s National Maritime Museum, this evocative, detailed, and thoroughly fascinating history brings this age of exploration and enlightenment vividly to life","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f55b27b63dae617a98b66aff22349a49c031f8dc","amp;dn":"Ships%2C+Clocks+and+Stars%3A+The+Quest+for+Longitude","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f55b27b63dae617a98b66aff22349a49c031f8dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,91,39,182,61,174,97,122,152,182,106,255,34,52,154,73,192,49,248,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
