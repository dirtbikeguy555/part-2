Ellis and Neil Soderstrom\nThe University of North Carolina Press | March 2015 | ISBN-10: 1469620979 | ePUB | 16.9 mb\n\nWhat if, one step at a time, we could make our gardens and landscapes more eco-friendly? Barbara W. Ellis's colorful, comprehensive guide shows homeowners, gardeners, garden designers, and landscapers how to do just that for the large and beautiful Chesapeake Bay watershed region. This area includes Maryland, Virginia, Delaware, Washington, D.C., and part of West Virginia (translating to portions of USDA Zones 6, 7, and 8). Here, mid-Atlantic gardeners, from beginners to advanced, will find the essential tools for taking steps to make their gardens part of the solution through long-term planning and planting. The guide is built from the ground up around six simple but powerful principles that anyone can use:\n* Reduce lawn\n* Build plant diversity\n* Grow native plants\n* Manage water runoff\n* Welcome wildlife\n* Garden wisely\nIncluded are detailed instructions for assessing and designing your particular garden or landscape site; choosing and caring for trees, shrubs, vines, ground covers, and flowers; and succeeding with such conditions as shade or poor soil. From rain gardens to woodland gardens, meadow gardens to wildlife gardens, and much more, this indispensable guide features more than 300 color photographs.\n\nAbout the Author\nFormer managing editor of gardening books at Rodale Press and publications director at the American Horticultural Society, Barbara W. Ellis is the author of Covering Ground: Unexpected Ideas for Landscaping with Colorful, Low-Maintenance Ground Covers, among other books.\n\nCONTENTS\nForeword by Eleanor Altman\nAcknowledgments\nIntroduction: Bay-Friendly Gardens and Landscapes\nWhere Do We Go from Here?\nBay-Friendly Basics\nDividends, Large and Small\nHow to Use This Book\nProgress, Not Perfection\nPART ONE: Creating Your Chesapeake Bay Landscape\nONE: Gardens and Landscapes That Benefit the Environment\nTWO: Creating an Ecological Landscape\nTHREE: Building Your Chesapeake Landscape\nPART TWO: Recommended Plants and Gardens\nFOUR: Shrubs, Trees, and Vines for Landscaping\nFIVE: Ground Covers for Chesapeake Landscapes\nSIX: Flowers for Chesapeake Gardens\nSEVEN: Plants and Gardens for Shade\nEIGHT: Water, Rain Gardens, and Wet Soil\nNINE: Gardens for Wildlife\nSuggested Resources\nIndex","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f5affb41337eb131ca0c16c482a3cd406fb5a13","amp;dn":"Chesapeake+Gardening+and+Landscaping+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f5affb41337eb131ca0c16c482a3cd406fb5a13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,90,255,180,19,55,235,19,28,160,193,108,72,42,60,212,6,251,90,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
