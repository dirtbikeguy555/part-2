(see 1994 in music and 1994 in film). This album peaked at #1 on &quot;Billboard's &quot;Top New Age Albums&quot; chart and at #5 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; chart in the same year. The film spent 229 weeks on Billboard's &quot;Top Music Video&quot; charts and &quot;Top VHS sales&quot; charts, and received an Emmy nomination in 1994 for &quot;Outstanding Individual Achievement in Lighting Direction (Electronic) for a Drama Series, Variety Series, Miniseries or a Special&quot;.\n\nIn a three-year television deal with PBS, the live television special was one of the top fundraising subjects for PBS, raising $13 million, with more than 750,000 home videos and more than 7 million albums sold worldwide. It has been seen in 65 countries by half a billion people, has almost continuously remained on the charts since its release, and is the second best-selling music video of all time, (behind Michael Jackson's video for Thriller with nine million units).\n\nThe composition, Acroyali/Standing in Motion, from this album, was determined to have the &quot;Mozart Effect&quot;, by the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine because it was similar to Mozart's K 448 in tempo, structure, melodic and harmonic consonance and predictability.\n\nThe corresponding concert tour of the year was &quot;Yanni Live, The Symphony Concerts 1994&quot;.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.iouppo.com/life/pic1/a53bf727955d369dbb322806711bb440.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.iouppo.com/life/pic1/a53bf727955d369dbb322806711bb440.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n1.
