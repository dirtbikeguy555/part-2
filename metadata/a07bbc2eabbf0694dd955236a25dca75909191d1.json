A searing novel of the Mafia underworld, The Godfather introduced readers to the first family of American crime fiction, the Corleones, and the powerful legacy of tradition, blood, and honor that was passed on from father to son. With its themes of the seduction of power, the pitfalls of greed, and family allegiance, it resonated with millions of readers across the world and became the definitive novel of the virile, violent subculture that remains steeped in intrigue, in controversy, and in our collective consciousness.\n\nMario Gianluigi Puzo (October 15, 1920 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ July 2, 1999) was an Italian American author and screenwriter, known for his novels about the Mafia, including The Godfather (1969), which was later co-adapted into a film by Francis Ford Coppola. He won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay in both 1972 and 1974.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a07bbc2eabbf0694dd955236a25dca75909191d1","amp;dn":"The+Godfather+Series+-+Mario+Puzo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a07bbc2eabbf0694dd955236a25dca75909191d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,123,188,46,171,191,6,148,221,149,82,54,162,93,202,117,144,145,145,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
