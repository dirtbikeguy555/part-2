Accordingly, the book discusses symmetries, conservation laws, relativity, and cosmological parameters and measurements, as well as the astrophysical behaviors of galaxies and galaxy clusters that indicate the presence of dark matter and the possible nature of dark matter distribution. This succinct yet comprehensive volume:\n\nAddresses all aspects essential to the study of dark matter\nExplores particle candidates for cold dark matter beyond the theory of the standard model, providing examples of basic extensions and introducing theories such as supersymmetry and extra dimensions\nExplainsÃ¢â‚¬â€in simple text and mathematical formulationsÃ¢â‚¬â€calculation of the freeze-out temperature of a dark matter species and its relic density\nProvides theoretical background for dark matter scattering off a target, event rate calculation, and dark matter annihilation essential to study direct and indirect detection of dark matter\nComplete with a detailed review of the latest dark matter experiments and techniques, Dark Matter: An Introduction is an ideal text for beginning researchers in the field as well as for general readers with an inquisitive mind, as the important topic of astroparticle physics is treated both pedagogically and with deeper insight.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad6d105beab9daabad762a1d1caefe1128f4eeaa","amp;dn":"Dark+Matter%2C+An+Introduction+%28Physics%29+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad6d105beab9daabad762a1d1caefe1128f4eeaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,109,16,91,234,185,218,171,173,118,42,29,28,174,254,17,40,244,238,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
