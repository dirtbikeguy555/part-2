It is staged not in a theatre but in a deconsecrated Victorian church, St PeterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, in the MurraysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Mills district, a 15-minute walk from the city centre. The audience, just 260 people, sits on hard wooden pews either side of a long, narrow corridor, a bit like a racing paddock, where most of the action unfolds.&quot;\n\n\nMy notes.\n\n   This is another in the plays I have brought to torrent files for all to share.  It is performance done live and in an unique location with technical skill.  The production avoids needless camera movement during the speeches and so avoids the pitfalls of looking like something made for television (quick cuts to retain audience 'attention' or to create 'excitement.')  \n\n  The skill of the screen director is best shown in the latter portion of the play and that same portion of the play contains my favorite performance:  that of MacDuff.  Stay with this play.  It is worth it for those moments.  The New Statesman piece describes  the setting and I had looked forward to it knowing it would come to media.  My hope is that others will take inspiration from it in the world community to which these torrents are given. \n\n  Thanks to the original uploader who was and is Anonymous.  The original torreant was 6 times the size of this mkv.  Assistance from video help sites gave me the tools to make this smaller version with audio that highlights all voice portions over sound effects. \n\nPlease help to share in the work.\n\nNotes written July 19th 2014\n\n  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:726395f0dbe720f3d6367c1d16ec4b6ebe2d21a8","amp;dn":"National+Theatre+Live+Macbeth+by+William+Shakespeare%282013%29++star","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"726395f0dbe720f3d6367c1d16ec4b6ebe2d21a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,99,149,240,219,231,32,243,214,54,124,29,22,236,75,110,190,45,33,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
