The album was released on July 18, 2001. The album was the third Jimmy Eat World album produced by former Drive Like Jehu drummer Mark Trombino. The album artwork is taken from William Eggleston's photograph &quot;Memphis&quot;.  Out of concern that its title could be misinterpreted following the September 11 attacks, the album was re-released with an eponymous title (Jimmy Eat World). In addition, the title track was renamed &quot;Salt Sweat Sugar.&quot;  On April 28, 2008, a deluxe edition of the album was released with a bonus disc containing several b-sides, acoustic versions, live versions, demo versions and previously unreleased tracks. The original album and track title Bleed American were restored.  The album was a critical and commercial success, helping the band gain mainstream popularity. Bleed American was well received by music critics and was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA), and silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI)..\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Bleed American\n[02] A Praise Chorus\n[03] The Middle\n[04] Your House\n[05] Sweetness\n[06] Hear You Me\n[07] If You Don't, Don't\n[08] Get It Faster\n[09] Cautioners\n[10] The Authority Song\n[11] My Sundown\n\nCD Play Time - 00h:46m:33s\n\n\nEn-Hanced CD Listing\n\nCD Rom: Interview and live footage\n\n\nTotal File Size....................... 225mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
