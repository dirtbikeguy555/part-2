It was released by the duo's imprint Daft Life, under exclusive license to Columbia Records, on May 17, 2013. The album pays tribute to the late 1970s and early 1980s era of music in the United States, particularly the sounds that emerged from Los Angeles. This sentiment is reflected in the gradual promotional rollout for the album that included billboards, television advertisements, and a web series.\nUnlike their previous studio albums, Daft Punk recruited session musicians to record live instrumentation in professional studio locations. The duo limited the use of electronic instruments to drum machines, a modular synthesizer, and vintage vocoders. The album features collaborations with Panda Bear, Julian Casablancas, Todd Edwards, DJ Falcon, Chilly Gonzales, Giorgio Moroder, Nile Rodgers, Paul Williams, and Pharrell Williams. Random Access Memories is the duo's most critically and commercially successful album to date, scoring 87/100 on Metacritic, and debuting at number one in twenty countries.\n\nTracklist:\n1 Give Life Back To Music\n2 The Game Of Love\n3 Giorgio By Moroder\n4 Within\n5 Instant Crush (feat.
