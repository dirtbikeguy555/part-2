During flow, people typically experience deep enjoyment, creativity, and a total involvement with life. In this new edition of his groundbreaking classic work, Csikszentmihalyi demonstrates the ways this positive state can be controlled, not just left to chance. Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience teaches how, by ordering the information that enters our consciousness, we can discover true happiness and greatly improve the quality of our lives.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d7df04da1edef7dc965c438ab07d20b6ce85449","amp;dn":"Mihaly+Csikszentmihalyi+-+Flow%3A+The+Psychology+of+Optimal+Experi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d7df04da1edef7dc965c438ab07d20b6ce85449","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,125,240,77,161,237,239,125,201,101,196,56,171,7,210,11,108,232,84,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
