The Indian edition upholds these international values while showcasing the best gadgets and technology available in India. \r\nWe went beyond the norm by exploring virtual reality big time, all courtesy of the biggest baddest champions of VR headsets in the game right now - Oculus and HTC Vive. Hell, even Audi has given a serious nod to virtual reality and we bring you all the down-low on it from our wondrous drive in one. Stay updated on all the news regarding Appleâ€™s jack-less iPhone7 launch plus a run down on the Samsung Galaxy Note 7. A war of smartphones is definitely in the offing. This month also sees us going gaga over Asusâ€™s liquid-cooled gaming laptop (a first of sorts) and HPâ€™s MacBook Air-challenger. All this and the usual convoy of tests follow.\r\n\r\nHOT STUFF\r\n10 The Hot Four\r\n? Apple iPhone 7\r\n? Acer Swift 7\r\n? Lenovo Yoga Book\r\n?
