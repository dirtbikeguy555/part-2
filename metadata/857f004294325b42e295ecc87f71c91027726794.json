Nomi is remembered for bizarrely theatrical live performances, heavy make-up, unusual costumes, and a highly stylized signature hairdo which flaunted a receding hairline. His songs were equally unusual, ranging from synthesizer-laden interpretations of classic opera to covers of 1960s pop standards like Chubby Checker&amp;#039;s &quot;The Twist&quot; and Lou Christie&amp;#039;s &quot;Lightnin&amp;#039; Strikes&quot;.\n\nHe was born Klaus Sperber in Immenstadt, Bavaria, Germany on January 24, 1944. In his youth in the 1960s, he worked as an usher at the Deutsche Oper in West Berlin where he would sing on stage in front of the fire curtain after the shows for the other ushers and maintenance crew. Around that time he also sang operatic arias at a Berlin gay club called Kleist Casino. Nomi moved from Germany to New York City in the mid-1970s. He began his involvement with the art scene based in the East Village. According to a documentary film made by Andrew Horn, Nomi took singing lessons and supported himself working as a pastry chef. Nomi was somehow notoriously known throughout all the cities he performed at for his favorite color, blue. Besides blue, Nomi did not use colors for any live performances or videos.\n\nNomi died on August 6, 1983 in New York City, one of the first celebrities to die of an illness complicated by AIDS. His ashes were scattered over New York City.&quot;(Wikipedia)\n\n01 Keys Of Life (2:26)\n02 Lightning Strikes (2:59)\n03 The Twist (3:10)\n04 Nomi Song (2:47)\n05 You Don&amp;#039;t Own Me (3:39)\n06 The Cold Song (4:03)\n07 Wasting My Time (4:16)\n08 Total Eclipse (3:29)\n09 Nomi Chant (1:53)\n10 Samson And Delilah (Aria) (3:43)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:857f004294325b42e295ecc87f71c91027726794","amp;dn":"Klaus+Nomi+-+1981+-+Klaus+Nomi+%28mp3%2F320%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"857f004294325b42e295ecc87f71c91027726794","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,127,0,66,148,50,91,66,226,149,236,200,127,113,201,16,39,114,103,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
