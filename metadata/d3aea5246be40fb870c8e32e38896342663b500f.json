Hawkins\nPublished: 2008\nPublisher: Veritas Publishing\nISBN: 9781933391885\nFormat: Retail Epub and PDF\nReader Required:\nEpub- Adobe Digital Editions, Calibre, MoonReader for Android\nPDF-Adobe Reader, Foxit, Nitro, Adobe Digital Editions\n\n\nThis is the seventh book in a progressive series based on the revelations of consciousness research. It describes in detail how to discern not only truth from falsehood but also the illusion of appearance from the actual core of inner reality. \n\nThe text explains how to differentiate perception from essence and thereby enables the reader to resolve the ambiguities and classical riddles that have challenged mankind for centuries and baffled the best minds in history. \n\nWhile modern technologies have provided a plethora of new toys and conveniences, the basic problems of daily existence remain. The human dilemma is in fact more confused than ever before, and the foundations of Western civilization have weakened under the onslaughts of rival factions and media barrage. Even the government is paralyzed by the gridlock of vociferous contentiousness. \n\nThe public has become like a focus group that is manipulated by media merchants. Thus, the populace is like a ship at sea with no compass, much less a GPS system. This book provides the tools to survive and regain autonomy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3aea5246be40fb870c8e32e38896342663b500f","amp;dn":"Reality%2C+Spirituality+and+Modern+Man-+David+R+Hawkins+%5BEpub+%26amp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3aea5246be40fb870c8e32e38896342663b500f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,174,165,36,107,228,15,184,112,200,227,46,56,137,99,66,102,59,80,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
