In KING CORN , recent college graduates Ian Cheney and Curt Ellis leave the east coast for rural Iowa, where they decide to grow an acre of the nationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most powerful crop.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlarmed by signs of AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bulging waistlines, the filmmakers arrive in the Midwest enthusiastic about their new endeavor. For their farm-to-be, they choose a tiny town in Floyd, County, IowaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a place that, coincidentally, both Ian and CurtÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s great-grandfathers called home three generations ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey lease an acre of land from a skeptical landlord, fill out a pile of paperwork to sign up for subsidies and discover the U.S. government will pay them 28 dollars for their acre. Ian and Curt start the spring by injecting ammonia fertilizer, which promises to increase crop production four-fold. Then itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s planting time. With a rented high-tech tractor, they set 31,000 seeds in the ground in just 18 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir corn has also been genetically modified for another yield-increasing characteristic: herbicide resistance. When the seedlings sprout from IowaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s black dirt, Ian and Curt apply a powerful herbicide to ensure that only their corn will thrive on their acre.\n\n\n\n&quot;The apple juices and the grape juices that are canned and they say 'sweetened,' thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s going to be a high-fructose corn syrup. And then you look down the meatsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½beefs, porks, chickens. You feed them corn and that gets turned into their biomass that we consume.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\nBy summer, their modern farm is thriving, and the Corn Belt is moving toward a record harvest of 11 billion bushels of corn. But where will all that corn go? With their crop growing head-high, Ian and Curt leave the farm to see where AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s abundance of corn ends up.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs they enter AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s industrial kitchen, they are forced to confront the realities of their cropÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s future. In Brooklyn, it sweetens the sodas of a diabetes-plagued neighborhood.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Colorado, it fattens the feed trough of a 100,000-head cattle feedlot. Ian and Curt are increasingly troubled by how the abundance of corn is helping to make fast food cheap and consumers sick, driving animals into confinement and farmers off the land.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimal nutritionists confirm that corn feeding can make cows sick and beef fatty, but it also lets consumers have fast food at low prices. As feedlot operator Bob Bledsoe says in KING CORN, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAmerica wants and demands cheap food.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ But that ignores the billions in subsidies that agri-corporations receive.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Ian and Curt discover, almost everything Americans eat contains corn. High-fructose corn syrup, corn-fed meat, and corn-based processed foods are the staples of the modern diet. AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s record harvests of corn are supported by a government subsidy system that promotes corn production beyond all market demand.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Ian and Curt return to Iowa to watch their 10,000-pound harvest fill the combineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hopper and make its way into AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s food, they realize their acre of land shouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be planted in corn againÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½if they can help it. .edit\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/independentlens/kingcorn/film.ht&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pbs.org/independentlens/kingcorn/film.ht&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch preview:http://www.pbs.org/independentlens/kingcorn/film.html\n\n\n\n\n\n:\n\n\n\nOther shunster posts\n\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2348fd16439cdf20deef18b1f607942b4be6f2d","amp;dn":"King+Corn+2007+PBS+Independent+Lens","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2348fd16439cdf20deef18b1f607942b4be6f2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,52,143,209,100,57,205,242,13,238,241,139,31,96,121,66,180,190,111,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
