What sets this book apart from many others in the space is the emphasis on real examples as opposed to just theory. Concepts are not only described, they are brought to life with actual trading strategies, which give the reader insight into how and why each strategy was developed, how it was implemented, and even how it was coded. This book is a valuable resource for anyone looking to create their own systematic trading strategies and those involved in manager selection, where the knowledge contained in this book will lead to a more informed and nuanced conversation with managers.&quot;\n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€DAREN SMITH, CFA, CAIA, FSA, Managing Director, Manager Selection &amp; Portfolio Construction, University of Toronto Asset Management\n\n&quot;Using an excellent selection of mean reversion and momentum strategies, Ernie explains the rationale behind each one, shows how to test it, how to improve it, and discusses implementation issues. His book is a careful, detailed exposition of the scientific method applied to strategy development. For serious retail traders, I know of no other book that provides this range of examples and level of detail. His discussions of how regime changes affect strategies, and of risk management, are invaluable bonuses.&quot;\n\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Roger Hunter, Mathematician and Algorithmic Trader\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPreface ix\n\nCHAPTER 1 Backtesting and Automated Execution 1\n\nCHAPTER 2 The Basics of Mean Reversion 39\n\nCHAPTER 3 Implementing Mean Reversion Strategies 63\n\nCHAPTER 4 Mean Reversion of Stocks and ETFs 87\n\nCHAPTER 5 Mean Reversion of Currencies and Futures 107\n\nCHAPTER 6 Interday Momentum Strategies 133\n\nCHAPTER 7 Intraday Momentum Strategies 155\n\nCHAPTER 8 Risk Management 169\n\nConclusion 187\n\nBibliography 191\n\nAbout the Author 197\n\nAbout the Website 199\n\nIndex 201\n\n\nAuthor Information\nERNEST P.
