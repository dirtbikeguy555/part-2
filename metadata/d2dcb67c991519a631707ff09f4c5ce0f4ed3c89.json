And this, his first cookbook, is every bit as sotisfying as a French Laundry meal itself: a series of small, Impeccable, highly refined, intensely focused courses.\nMost dazzling is how simple Keller's methods are: squeegeeing the moisture from the skin on fish so it sautes beautjfully; poochlng eggs In a deep pot of water for perfect shope; the initial steeping in the shell that makes cooking raw lobster out of the shell a cinch; using vinegar as a flavor enhancer; the repeated washing of bones for stock for the cleanest, clearest tastes.\nFrom innovative soup techniques, to the proper way to cook green vegetables, to secrets of great fish cookery, to the creation of breathtaking desserts; from beurre monte to foie gras au torchon, to a wild and thoroughly unexpected take on coffee and doughnuts, The French Laundry Cookbook captures, through recipes, essays, profiles, and extraordinary photography, one of America's great restaurants, its great chef, and the food that makes both unique. One hundred and fifty superlative recipes are exact recipes from the French Laundry kitchenno shortcuts have been taken, no critical steps ignored, all have been thoroughly tested in home kitchens. If you can't get to the French Laundry, you can now re-create at home the very experience the Wine Spectator described as &quot;as close to dining perfection as it gets.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2dcb67c991519a631707ff09f4c5ce0f4ed3c89","amp;dn":"The+French+Laundry+Cookbook+%282nd+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2dcb67c991519a631707ff09f4c5ce0f4ed3c89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,220,182,124,153,21,25,166,49,112,127,240,159,76,92,224,244,237,60,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
