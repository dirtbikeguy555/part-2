It combines underlying theory with dozens of exercises designed to reveal the actor's craft. There is material on constructing the throughline, analyzing the script, character needs; the casting and rehearsal processes, film vs. theater procedures as well as the actor and the camera. \n\nDistilling difficult concepts and a complex task to their simplest form, the author explains how to accurately capture and portray human behavior. The author's discussion of creative problems she has encountered or anticipated after years of experience, and her suggested solutions and exercises, are immediately useful. Additionally, hear what the actors have to say in excerpts from interviews with acclaimed actors such as Meryl Streep, Denzel Washington, Glenn Close, Robert Redford, Christopher Walken, Julianne Moore, and Michael Douglas (to name a few) who discuss their work with directors, what inspires them, and what they really want from the director.\n\n&quot;It is a difficult book to describe, but a fascinating one to read - essentially the author manages to explain how a director must capture and portray human behaviour.&quot; - Image Technology\n\n&quot;The essence of Lenore's distinctive methods, developed over many years, can be found in the pages of this excellent, clearly written book.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n-Ang Lee, Director, Brokeback Mountain, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\n\n&quot;Lenore DeKoven says in her introduction to her book, Changing Direction, that 'everyone wants to be in show business'. Well I am, but I've never wanted to direct. After reading Lenore's book, I may reconsider my career choice.&quot; \n-Edward Asner, Actor/Producer\n\n&quot;I was one of the many people who over the years, asked Lenore to write her book, and finally she has. It's a thrill to read, as well as a reminder of her great gift -- her deep understanding of drama, directing, actors, everyday life, and most importantly her wealth of experience and huge heart. I will draw from this every time I work.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n--Kimberly Peirce, writer/director of Boys Don't Cry, Stop-Loss, student of Lenore's\n\n&quot;Lenore DeKoven has written a great book for the director searching for practical advice on the techniques of directing actors. Her work as a teacher has already affected a generation of young filmmakers, including Kim Peirce (Boys Don't Cry). One would be hard-pressed to find a more comprehensive and clear approach to working with actors.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n--Bette Gordon, Director and Acting Chair of Film Division, School of the Arts, Columbia University\n\n&quot;This book is much needed on the shelves for students and individuals interested in directing actors for film and theatre. Very few books offer this approach with such specific and practical steps laid out in detail, step by step.&quot; \n-Sheldon Schiffer, Georgia State University","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53f8290a633dfe0ec0efb250ad59bcae72946c5c","amp;dn":"Changing+Direction+%3A+A+Practical+Approach+to+Directing+Actors+in","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53f8290a633dfe0ec0efb250ad59bcae72946c5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,248,41,10,99,61,254,14,192,239,178,80,173,89,188,174,114,148,108,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
