An almost silent figure \namong Ibizian romanticists, Green began in Brighton, debuting in 1999 with a \ntrack on Tru Thoughts Recordings&amp;#039; When Shapes Join Together compilation. Though \ntempted by offers from Mute and XL after the official issue of &quot;The Scuba EP&quot; \nand the &quot;Terrapin&quot; single, Green stuck with Tru Thoughts for the acclaimed debut \nLP Animal Magic. Highlighted by downtempo dub, funk, and an equally likable use \nof sitars, Animal Magic was an obvious success and plans were quickly made for \ncareful European support appearances, as well as a follow-up album, Dial &quot;M&quot; for \n Monkey, for Coldcut&amp;#039;s Ninja Tune label. A tour to support the record followed \nand was documented on the 2005 EP Live Sessions. \n                                   (by Dean Carlson - http://www.allmusic.com )\n\nListeners Review: http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A15728655\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKiba Informs:\nThis is the latest album from Bonobo. If you want the other albums you may \ndownload them here: http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3528562/Bonobo_-_Discography\nI have tried to get this album for months, and I finnally found it on eMule. There are two versions of this album; one with 18 tracks, and one with 11 (this one). I actually bought this CD, but CDON needed more than a month to get it. It supposed to be in my mailbox soon. So if its the 18 track version i bought, I will put it out on the Pirat Bay.\nMore of my torrents:                          &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/Kiba&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/Kiba&lt;/a&gt;\n\n                   \n                  Give some feedback!\n               ***************************\n               *Please Seed at least 150%*\n               ***************************\n                      Enjoy! -Kiba\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1c18791fa91b274a9c92fba55390543d1bbc4fa","amp;dn":"Bonobo+-+Days+To+Come+%5B2006%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1c18791fa91b274a9c92fba55390543d1bbc4fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,193,135,145,250,145,178,116,169,201,47,186,85,57,5,67,209,187,196,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
