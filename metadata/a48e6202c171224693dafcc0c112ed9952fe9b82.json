Tolkien\n\nJohn Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born on January 3, 1892 at Bloemfontien,\ncapital of the Orange Free State in South Africa. His English father,\nArthur Tolkien, was employed as manager of the local branch of the Bank\nof Africa. When he was three years old, Ronald (as he was known to his\nfamily) and his younger brother, Hilary, were brought back to England by\ntheir mother, Mabel Tolkien. Before they could return to South Africa,\ntheir father died of rheumatic fever. Mrs. Tolkien and the boys remained\nin England, living for a while in a cottage at Sarehole Mill, near\nBirmingham, then moving to suburban Moseley in 1890. The same year,\nMabel Tolkien experienced a conversion to the Catholic faith; this event\n\nhad a lasting effect on Ronald, and Catholicism became a motivating\nforce in his life and writings. As a child, Ronald Tolkien spent\nconsiderable time inventing imaginary languages, a hobby which lead\neventually to the creation of an imaginary world where such tongues\nmight be spoken.\n\nHe was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham, and from 1911-1915\nat Exeter College, Oxford, where he read English Language and Literature\nand acquired an extensive knowledge of Anglo-Saxon and Middle English.\nThese subjects were to become important not only to his later academic\nwritings and translations, but also to the shaping of his own fictional\nmythologies.\n\nIn 1916, he married Edith Bratt, and went to serve in the Great War as a\nSecond Lieutenant with the 11th Lancashire Fusiliers. Towards the end of\nthe year he was sent home from the Somme suffering from trench fever,\nand during his convalescence began writing his Book of Lost Tales, a\ncollection of stories about his imaginary world that was eventually to\nbe known as The Silmarillion.\n\nAfter the war, he worked briefly on the Oxford English Dictionary. Then,\nhaving spent a year as Professor of English Language at Leeds\nUniversity, he returned to Oxford in 1925 as Professor of Anglo-Saxon.\n\nThe Tolkiens had three sons and a daughter, and it was to his children\nthat Ronald first told the story of Mr. Bilbo Baggins, an unadventurous\nhobbit who finds himself having the most surprising adventures. Because\nthe story was a favorite, he began to write it down around 1930. The\npublishing house of George Allen and Unwin heard about the story and\nencouraged Tolkien to complete the book. He did so, and it was published\nin 1937 as The Hobbit or There and Back Again. It was a huge success and\nthe publishers requested a sequel. Tolkien had already offered them The\nSilmarillion (though it was far from completed), but they were looking\nfor another book &quot;about the hobbit.&quot; Then, in December 1937, Tolkien\nwrote to them: &quot;I have written the first chapter of a new story about\nHobbitsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½'A long expected party.' A merry Christmas.&quot;\n\nThus began the long, erratic process of creating The Lord of the Rings.\nFor the next twelve years, the work moved slowly towards completion;\nfrequently put aside, once or twice almost abandoned. But encourage by\nhis publishers, his family and his close friend C.S. Lewis, Tolkien\nworked away, writing, re-writing, extending and embellishing the story.\nAs the work developed, it took surprising turns, threw up new and\nunprecedented conflicts and introduced the simple, vulnerable hobbits\ninto a world of great heroes and mighty powers. It was the very world\nwhose early history Tolkien had been recording in The Silmarillion. Few\nwriters have undertaken the task of creating a new world with such\nthoroughness: Middle-earthÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½the world of The Lord of the RingsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½has a\ngeography, language, literature, history, mythology, flora and fauna\nthat is unique and unparalleled. The Lord of the Rings was completed in\n1949, but publication was further delayed while Tolkien tried to find a\npublisher who would agree to publish both The Lord of the Rings and The\nSilmarillion. When this proved impossible, Tolkien allowed Allen and\nUnwin to publish The Lord of the Rings on its own.\n\nThe book received a mixed critical reception: C.S. Lewis described it as\nbeing &quot;like lightning from a clear sky.&quot; while American critic Edmund\nWilson called it &quot;long-winded balderdash,&quot; but they soon found an\nadmiring readership. With the publication in America, in 1965, of an\nunauthorized paperback edition, the Tolkien cult began in earnest,\nproclaiming its admiration by every means from theses to graffiti. In\n1971, Tolkien's wife died, and the following year he received the CBE\nand honorary Doctorate of letters from Oxford University.\n\nTolkien died on September 2, 1973 at age 81.\n\nPerhaps the best insight into his personal philosophy is to be found in\nhis short story Leaf by Niggle in which an artist spends his life\nengaged on a painting of a tree which he constantly reworks and\nretouches. When summoned to take a final journey, he leaves the picture\nincomplete, and with the passing years the work of a lifetime is\nneglected and destroyedÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½save for a small scrap of canvas bearing a\nsingle leaf. At the end of his journey, however, the artist comes to a\nland where his tree, now complete, forms part of a creation more perfect\nthan the artist had ever envisaged.\n\nThe Silmarillion, edited by Christopher Tolkien, was finally and\nposthumously published in 1977.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Map courtesy of http://users.telenet.be/endorion/eng/Maps/maps_beleriand.htm\n\nThis is the original map, drawn by Tolkien, included with the boxed set.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a48e6202c171224693dafcc0c112ed9952fe9b82","amp;dn":"J.R.R.+Tolkien+-+The+Silmarillion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a48e6202c171224693dafcc0c112ed9952fe9b82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,142,98,2,193,113,34,70,147,218,252,192,193,18,237,153,82,254,155,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
