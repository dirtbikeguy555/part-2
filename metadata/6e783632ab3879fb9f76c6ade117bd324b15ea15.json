The game is currently in alpha and contains a wide range of single player content including:\n\n    A creative mode allowing you to push your designs to the limit and ensure the total annihilation of your opponents.\n    A campaign waged over hundreds of islands against eight unique factions.\n    A Story Mode where you can (eventually!) play 15 missions as each of the eight factions - a fantastic mixture of strategy, design and wild battles! Defend your fleet against waves of enemy forces in a series of extremely tough challenges that unlock new components. \n\nAn expansive multiplayer and co-op element is planned for the coming months!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e783632ab3879fb9f76c6ade117bd324b15ea15","amp;dn":"From+the+Depths+v1.773","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e783632ab3879fb9f76c6ade117bd324b15ea15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,120,54,50,171,56,121,251,159,118,198,173,225,23,189,50,75,21,234,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
