VSYNC enabled causes some frame drops when turning fast.\n- Please read the known issues, there are some important notes.\n\nMy System Specs:\n- OS: OSX Mountain Lion 10.8.4Ã¢â‚¬Â¨\n- CPU: Intel Core i7 3770k @ 3.5GHz\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¨- RAM: 32 GB 1333 MHz DDR3\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¨- Video: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 2047 MB\n\n\n\nNotes about wrapper:\n\nIF YOU ARE AN AMD USER THAT USES OSX Lion 10.7.5:\nYou will probably (most likely) experience severe lag. Please try and upgrade to 10.8.3 since wine does not function well with AMD GPUs and 10.7.5.\n\n\nKnown Issues (***IMPORTANT***):\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¨- Issue 1: If you attempt to run the game but you get a very brief black screen and the wrapper then shuts down, chances are that the game is trying to start on an unsupported resolution (e.g. 1920 x 1058).\n\n- Solution: TO FIX THIS, Simply right click the wrapper, show package contents, open Wineskin, click Set Screen Options and UNCHECK &quot;Use Mac Driver instead of X11&quot;. Then simply run the wrapper again, set your game resolution to your NATIVE resolution (e.g. 1920 x 1080), exit and save your graphics settings.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¨IF THE WRAPPER DOES NOT RUN:\nRight click the wrapper, show package contents, go into the folders: drive_c. &gt; user &gt; wineskin &gt; local settings &gt; application data &gt; payday 2\nDELETE The PAYDAY 2 folder and it will hopefully work !\n\nLastly, go back into wineskin and CHECK &quot;Use Mac Driver instead of X11&quot;. Please note that if you are on 10.6, you may wish to play with X11 instead of Mac Driver.\n\n\n\n- Issue 2: If the game seems to crash at the loading screen when trying to load either a mission or go to the safe house, there is a simple fix.\n\n- Solution: TO FIX THIS, Simply right click the wrapper, show package contents, open Wineskin, click Set Screen Options and MAKE SURE &quot;Auto detect GPU Info for Direct3D&quot; is UNCHECKED! (it may all ready be unchecked).\n\nAlso, try lowering/disabling some Advanced graphics settings such as Lowering Anisotropic Filtering from 16X down to 8X or 4X. Also try disabling 'Depth of Field' in advanced graphics settings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9320de5cbf6ba7708660587ed63f1ecc9fbe138","amp;dn":"Payday+2+%5BMac%5D+%5BWineskin%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9320de5cbf6ba7708660587ed63f1ecc9fbe138","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,50,13,229,203,246,186,119,8,102,5,135,237,99,241,236,201,251,225,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
