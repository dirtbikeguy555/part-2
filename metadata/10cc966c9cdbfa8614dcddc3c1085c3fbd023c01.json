A Beautiful Bastard. \n\nBennett has returned to Chicago from France to take a vital role in his family's massive media business. He never expected that the assistant who'd been helping him from abroad was the gorgeous, innocently provocativeÃ¢â‚¬â€completely infuriatingÃ¢â‚¬â€creature he now has to see every day. Despite the rumors, he's never been one for a workplace hookup. But Chloe's so tempting he's willing to bend the rulesÃ¢â‚¬â€or outright smash themÃ¢â‚¬â€if it means he can have her.

A girl determined to finally live. And a secret liaison revealed in all too vivid color. Book two in the NYT Bestselling series. \n\nEscaping a cheating ex, finance whiz Sara Dillon's moved to New York City and is looking for excitement without a lot of strings attached. So meeting the irresistible, sexy Brit at a dance club should have meant nothing more than a night's fun. But the manner--and speed--with which he melts her inhibitions turns him from a one-time hookup and into her Beautiful Stranger.\n\nThe whole city knows Max Stella loves women, not that he's ever found one he particularly wants to keep around. Despite pulling in plenty with his Wall Street bad boy charm, it's not until Sara--and the wild photos she lets him take of her--that he starts wondering if there's someone for him outside of the bedroom.\n\nHooking up in places where anybody could catch them, the only thing scarier for Sara than getting caught in public is having Max get too close in private.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10cc966c9cdbfa8614dcddc3c1085c3fbd023c01","amp;dn":"Beautiful+Bastard+Series+%281-2%29+by+Christina+Lauren+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10cc966c9cdbfa8614dcddc3c1085c3fbd023c01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,204,150,108,156,219,250,134,20,220,221,195,193,8,92,63,189,2,60,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
