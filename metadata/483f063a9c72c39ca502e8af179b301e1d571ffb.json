As the sun sets over Atlantic Island Park, you must explore its dilapidated rides in search of your son, Callum. As darkness falls, you will experience panic and paranoia through a narrative written by a team of award winning storytellers.\r\nAmusement parks are happy places, filled with the joys of childhood and the exhilarating rush of fantastic rides to be dared. That was the vision of eccentric business man Nathaniel Winter when he opened the doors to Atlantic Island Park in 1977.\r\nUnfortunately, the park's history turned out to be one plagued by tragedy and drama. Its freak accidents, grotesque killings and ghostly hauntings have inspired many a sensational headline, and locals worry the park is far from done claiming innocent lives.\r\nFor Lorraine, it's where her worst nightmare began.\r\nWARNING: This experience deals with subject matter that might prove emotionally distressing to some. Player discretion is advised.\r\nExplore Atlantic Island Park and step onto rides such as the Ferris Wheel, the Bumper Cars and the Rollercoaster; just beware, some of them have a life of their own.\r\nEnter the mind of Lorraine, a woman facing every parent's worst nightmare, and unravel her story as well as the dark and tragic history of the park.\r\nCall out for Callum to respond, and interact with the environment around you while examining clues and listening to Lorraine's own inner voice as the game progresses.\r\nCompelling graphics and audio deliver a uniquely atmospheric setting rich in mood and mystery, developed by a team of award-winning AAA developers.\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: 7 64 Bit / 8 64 Bit / 10 64 Bit\r\nProcessor: Core i5 processor or equivalent \r\nMemory: 4 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: Intel HD4400 / AMD Radeon 5750 1Gb VRAM / NVidia Geforce 640 1Gb VRAM \r\nDirectX: Version 11 \r\nStorage: 4 GB available space\r\nMouse &amp; Keyboard\r\n\r\nRecommended system requirements - Windows: 7 64 Bit / 8 64 Bit / 10 64 Bit \r\nProcessor: Core i5 processor or equivalent \r\nMemory: 8 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: NVIDIA 760 series 2Gb VRAM or better / AMD Radeon R9 270X 2Gb VRAM or better \r\nDirectX: Version 11 \r\nStorage: 4 GB available space\r\nMouse &amp; Keyboard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:483f063a9c72c39ca502e8af179b301e1d571ffb","amp;dn":"The+Park+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"483f063a9c72c39ca502e8af179b301e1d571ffb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,63,6,58,156,114,195,156,165,2,232,175,23,155,48,30,29,87,31,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
