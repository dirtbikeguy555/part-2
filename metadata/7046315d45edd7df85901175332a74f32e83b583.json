Where the exact same studio recording was used, I have left these tracks out. For example, &amp;#039;Bigger Stronger&amp;#039; appears first on the &amp;#039;Safety&amp;#039; EP, then later on &amp;#039;The Blue Room&amp;#039; EP. In these instances I have opted to include the song on the earliest release only. Where different studio recordings were used I have included them all. For instance, &amp;#039;Brothers &amp; Sisters&amp;#039; appears three times, but each from an entirely different studio recording.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7046315d45edd7df85901175332a74f32e83b583","amp;dn":"Coldplay+-+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7046315d45edd7df85901175332a74f32e83b583","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,70,49,93,69,237,215,223,133,144,17,117,51,42,116,243,46,131,181,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
