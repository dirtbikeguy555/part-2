Bringing her show straight from the stage and into your lounge room is the DVD of her latest tour which was filmed in Sydney on the 17th and 18th of July 2009.\n\nFrom the opening where you see Pink waking up on the couch after a big night, you know that you are going to be in for a visual feast and a truly theatrical performance. A pantomime starts the show by running around the stage exciting the crowd and turning a gear to lift our favorite performer out of a trap door.\n\nThe costume changes show more and more of Pink's athletically toned body and enough sequins that any drag queen would be jealous. From the flowing skirts through to the red leather pants, she looks quite at home in each outfit.\n\nThe best thing about the entire DVD is that she looks like she is having fun on stage. Some live shows, even some DVD releases of live shows, the artists look bored or like they're just going through the motions of their performance. Pink is vibrant in her performance and captures the viewers attention with effortless ease. \n\n\n\n# Actors: Pink\n# Directors: Larn Poland;Baz Halpern;Paul Mirkovich\n# Format: Color, Explicit Lyrics, Live, NTSC\n# Language: English (Dolby Digital 5.1), English (PCM Stereo)\n# Region: Region 1 (U.S. and Canada only.
