Recognising the public's increasing need for access to the same medical information doctors have, Merck responded with the HOME EDITION. This contained virtually all the information in the physician's version, but in easy-to-understand, everyday language, with a reader-friendly format. Since its publication three years ago the HOME EDITION has gone on to sell more than 2 million copies worldwide. Now Merck have updated the edition to cater for the changing medical environment. The new edition contains new chapters on subjects ranging from Gene Therapy Heart disease Cancer Nutrition problems Hormonal problems Men's, women's and children's health issues\r\n\r\nThe Merck Manual â€” Home Health Handbook is a clear, comprehensive reference that covers the whole family - - newborns, older adults, and everyone in between.\r\n\r\nThis new book features an in-depth pediatrics section and a broad discussion on coping with the changes of aging and caregiving.\r\n\r\nCovers a Wide Array of Medical Topics:\r\n\r\nSwine Flu\r\nAging\r\nHeart disorders\r\nCancer\r\nAnd many more!\r\n\r\nWritten by more than 300 medical experts, The Merck Manual Home Health Handbook brings the latest medical insights to the everyday reader and continues the best-selling tradition from Merck, which is know as MSD outside of U.S.A and Canada.\r\n\r\n=======================================\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.org/user/shtihl22\r\n\r\n=======================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e36145c0ba43343a2f047d33d6dc15d74d303b19","amp;dn":"The+Merck+Manual+Home+Health+Handbook%2C+3rd+edition+-+epub%2C+mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e36145c0ba43343a2f047d33d6dc15d74d303b19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,97,69,192,186,67,52,58,47,4,125,51,214,220,21,215,77,48,59,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
