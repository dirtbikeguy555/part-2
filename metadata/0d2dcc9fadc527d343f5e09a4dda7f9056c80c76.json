After recovering from a shooting in late 2001, The Game pursued a rap career and was discovered by Dr. Dre who signed him to his Aftermath Entertainment label. The album features production provided by but not limited to Dr. Dre, Kanye West, and Timbaland, and guest vocals from 50 Cent, Eminem, Nate Dogg, and Faith Evans, among others.\n\nThe Documentary debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 586,000 units in the first week. The Recording Industry Association of America certified the album two times platinum in March 2005 and it sold over five million copies worldwide. The album received generally favorable reviews, with music critics praising the album's production. Since the album's release, The Game has been credited as a driving force in reviving the West Coast hip hop scene, which had been overshadowed by artists from the East, Midwest and South.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d2dcc9fadc527d343f5e09a4dda7f9056c80c76","amp;dn":"The+Game+-+The+Documentary+%282005%29+320kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d2dcc9fadc527d343f5e09a4dda7f9056c80c76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,45,204,159,173,197,39,211,67,245,224,154,77,218,127,144,86,200,12,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
