Players will have to keep in line and juggle their time sensibly as they form their personal plan of escape; working out potential routes to use as well as being incredibly smart and clever in using what seem like harmless items to craft and create various weaponry and escape tools which help aid the player in their ultimate goal of escaping. Players are tasked with advancing their character's statistics through various means such as exercising regularly and ensuring to boost their intellect as well... Whilst remembering to attend roll call, hold down their job and keep the inmates on side if you're to be successful in trading with them and ultimately... Don't forget to escape!&quot;\n\nChangelog:\nv0.795 (Update #3: The Shankton Redemption):\n- NEW: Shankton State Pen map\n- NEW: Option to rename all inmates and guards\n- NEW: List of items added, mostly map specific\n- NEW: Prisoner stash crates (loot)\n- NEW: New animations - chipping, cutting, digging, cleaning, weeding\n- NEW: Infirmary Staff NPC\n- CHANGE: Crafting notes are now saved universal, not limited to a specific run\n- CHANGE: Crafting note is added to journal when crafting an item not already in\n- CHANGE: Custom maps section on prison select ready for future map editor levels\n- CHANGE: Updated items that can be eaten/taken for HP/fatigue\n- CHANGE: Capped the amount of times you can spam giving inmates items to prevent OPN abuse\n- BUG: Fixed rotated vent slats\n- BUG: Giving NPCs cash now works\n- BUG: Inmates not fighting amongst themselves\n- BUG: Steam offline mode bug fixed\n- BUG: Making overalls from POW Outfit\n- BUG: Filling in holes and re-digging it bug sorted\n- BUG: Typo in Stalag Flucht warden welcome\n- BUG: Loud page sound when scrolling journal crafting notes\n- BUG: Attempted fix for not listing save files on title\nv0.792:\n- Some minor fixes.\nv0.791:\nAdditions\n- Stalag Flucht map\n- Workout routines\n- Four new jobs- tailor, deliveries, library, gardening\n- Multiple save slots\n- Free period musical themes for Center Perks and Stalag Flucht\nChanges\n- Lowered fatigue drain on workouts a little\n- Message now tells you when an item breaks\n- Nerfed digging value of trowel\n- Dirt generally now only appears inside, weeds outside\n- Wall block item is treated same as dirt when found by guards\n- Items can be taken from work containers if in range, regardless of job\n- On busted, illegal items in vents, underground, and roof are also removed\n- Updated job board descriptions\n- Chance of better finds while desk raiding\nBug Fixes\n- Fixed some bugs relating to removing fake walls/vents\n- Work key now opens all work doors as intended\n- Can no longer target while in beds/on equipment/in cupboards\n- CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t walk off roof pipes onto obstacles below\n- Fixed solitary letter for getting KOd at lockdown\n- You get heat for being attacked near guards\n\nIf you like the game, support the developer, buy it!  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/298630/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/298630/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e7abc7e1de66ffc9242e0a520c144d26003e6da","amp;dn":"The+Escapists+v0.795","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e7abc7e1de66ffc9242e0a520c144d26003e6da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,122,188,126,29,230,111,252,146,66,224,165,32,193,68,210,96,3,230,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
