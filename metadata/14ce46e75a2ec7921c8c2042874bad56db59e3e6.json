What are these drugs? What do they do to the body? And is it worth it?\r\nXand's investigation reveals the extraordinary gamble dopers take with their health. Long-term effects include kidney failure, cognitive impairment and testicular shrinkage, and Xand witnesses how users are self-experimenting with drugs that have not yet been approved for human use.\r\nHorizon uncovers the new frontier of doping, from new molecules to gene therapy - where the genes that control muscle growth are altered. These new methods could be completely undetectable by the doping authorities. Finally, with the help of his twin brother Chris, Xand discovers the legal ways some athletes try to gain the edge.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8e/Sports-Doping-Winning-at-Any-Cost-Screen0.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/ff/Sports-Doping-Winning-at-Any-Cost-Screen1.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/54/Sports-Doping-Winning-at-Any-Cost-Screen2.jpg \r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b2/Sports-Doping-Winning-at-Any-Cost-Screen3.jpg\r\n \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/11/Sports-Doping-Winning-at-Any-Cost-Screen4.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/e/ec/Sports-Doping-Winning-at-Any-Cost-Screen5.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/e/ea/Sports-Doping-Winning-at-Any-Cost-Screen6.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/d/d2/Sports-Doping-Winning-at-Any-Cost-Screen7.jpg\r\n\r  http://docuwiki.net/images/f/f6/Sports-Doping-Winning-at-Any-Cost-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CALVC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: 1212 Kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 832 x 468\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\r\nAudio: English\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 59 mins\r\nNumber Of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 567 MB\r\n\r\nContainer: MP4\r\nSource: PDTV\r\nEncoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English subtitles\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \r\n * http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07ll97c","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14ce46e75a2ec7921c8c2042874bad56db59e3e6","amp;dn":"BBC.Horizon.2016.Sports.Doping.Winning.At.Any.Cost.PDTV.x264.AAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14ce46e75a2ec7921c8c2042874bad56db59e3e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,206,70,231,90,46,199,146,28,140,32,66,135,75,173,86,219,89,227,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
