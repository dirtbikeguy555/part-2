In this very special Christmas album, Frank Sinatra transforms these timeless impressions into a tapestry of Christmas music both new and old. The first part of the album is devoted to popular Yuletide favorites of recent origin; the second is a collection of the more traditional carols. Lending a richly-woven instrumental and choral backdrop to each of Frank&amp;#039;s selections are the orchestra and the Ralph Brewster Singers both directed by Gordon Jenkins. Presented with all the warmth, good cheer and best wishes at his command, here are the songs of Christmas as only Frank Sinatra sings them.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6e2baad3cc3dc406471078aeb3db45a41241281","amp;dn":"Frank+Sinatra+-+The+Christmas+Album+%5B192kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6e2baad3cc3dc406471078aeb3db45a41241281","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,226,186,173,60,195,220,64,100,113,7,138,235,61,180,90,65,36,18,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
