Eessentially an ensemble recorded live in the studio, Callahan's Apocalypse is the corpus delecti. Something happened here! If tape is like meat, this record is the whole hog! Callahan, riding on the back of his band, corrals them all &amp; guides them single-handedly through the valley with love &amp; ferocity. This record makes us wonder what has really happened in the last 100 years, &amp; what will happen in the next 10. The soul of your country called and left you a message. 7 messages. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c295e6b5d4c3fa2fe3214ef388293749f292b82","amp;dn":"Bill+Callahan+-+Apocalypse+%5Bmp3-320-2011%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c295e6b5d4c3fa2fe3214ef388293749f292b82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,41,94,107,93,76,63,162,254,50,20,239,56,130,147,116,159,41,43,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
