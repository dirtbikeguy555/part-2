When Ford began writing tunes for his follow-up he decided to lay them down in a way seldom employed these days: by recording the entire album in a single day.\nFord convened a choice band Ã¢â‚¬â€œ guitarist Audley Freed, keyboardist Ricky Peterson, bassist Brian Allen, drummer Wes Little, and trombonist Barry Green Ã¢â‚¬â€œ at the storied Sound Kitchen Studio in Nashville, and set about recording a live record in a controlled environment. He wrote seven of the nine tunes here, and they walk the lineÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nbetween wonderfully contoured numbers that showcase his singing skills and contemporary and soul-inflected blues.\nThe contribution from Green adds another dimension to the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound. Yes, it is polished, but both production and mix are empathic; despite the overdubs, the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s live energy comes through. Opener Ã¢â‚¬Å“Green Grass RainwaterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is shuffling, Southern R&amp;B with excellent guitar fills and vamps, spare, layered, punchy trombone, and swirling B-3. It also features one of FordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best vocals here. Ã¢â‚¬Å“AinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Drinking Beer No More,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with its swinging combination of B-3 and Ã¢â‚¬Ëœbone, is a high point. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Midnight Comes Too SoonÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a more conventional, contemporary blues, with FordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guitar in trademark minor-key sting. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Top Down BluesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a funky instrumental, with AllenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bass leading the charge. The twinned guitars and trombone add strut and swagger before Ford solos. There are two choice covers here: the burning Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cut You LooseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (first recorded by James Cotton) provides canny interplay between the guitarists and Peterson, LittleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s driving drum in the back, and AllenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rolling bassline. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Poor Kelly Blues,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ written by Maceo Merriweather, is done Chicago style. Slippery chord voicings by Freed support FordÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s taut fills as the rest of the band rave up in the turnarounds. At first, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Thump and Bump,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ an instrumental jazz tune, seems an odd choice; it isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a solid band showcase that reveals what they are capable of. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Just Another Country RoadÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a jazzy R&amp;B number that perfectly bookends the opener, featuring the entire band swinging hard. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got an excellent chart and fills by Green, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the only place on the set that Ford really cuts loose. A Day in Nashville isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t raw, but it is immediate and soulful. It is the sound class musicians make when they simply get down to doing what they do best: playing together.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e1a86b1de630650d0c83b3f54f1d563a21cb294","amp;dn":"Robben+Ford+-+A+Day+In+Nashville+%282014%29+MP3%40320kbps+Beolab1700","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e1a86b1de630650d0c83b3f54f1d563a21cb294","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,26,134,177,222,99,6,80,208,200,59,63,84,241,213,99,162,28,178,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
