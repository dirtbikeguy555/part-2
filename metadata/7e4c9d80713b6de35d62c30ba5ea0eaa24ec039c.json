It is a rich and brilliant chronicle of life and death, and the tragicomedy of humankind. In the noble, ridiculous, beautiful, and tawdry story of the BuendÃƒÂ­a family, one sees all of humanity, just as in the history, myths, growth, and decay of Macondo, one sees all of Latin America.\n\nLove and lust, war and revolution, riches and poverty, youth and senility -- the variety of life, the endlessness of death, the search for peace and truth -- these universal themes dominate the novel. Whether he is describing an affair of passion or the voracity of capitalism and the corruption of government, Gabriel GarcÃƒÂ­a MÃƒÂ¡rquez always writes with the simplicity, ease, and purity that are the mark of a master.\n\nAlternately reverential and comical, One Hundred Years of Solitude weaves the political, personal, and spiritual to bring a new consciousness to storytelling. Translated into dozens of languages, this stunning work is no less than an accounting of the history of the human race.\n\nISBN-13: 9780060883287\n______\n\n\nThe Author:\n__\n\nGabriel JosÃƒÂ© de la Concordia GarcÃƒÂ­a MÃƒÂ¡rquez (6 March 1927 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 17 April 2014) was a Colombian novelist, short-story writer, screenwriter and journalist, known affectionately as Gabo throughout Latin America. Considered one of the most significant authors of the 20th century, he was awarded the 1972 Neustadt International Prize for Literature and the 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature. He pursued a self-directed education that resulted in his leaving law school for a career in journalism. From early on, he showed no inhibitions in his criticism of Colombian and foreign politics. In 1958, he married Mercedes Barcha; they had two sons, Rodrigo and Gonzalo.\n\nGarcÃƒÂ­a MÃƒÂ¡rquez started as a journalist, and wrote many acclaimed non-fiction works and short stories, but is best known for his novels, such as One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967), The Autumn of the Patriarch (1975) and Love in the Time of Cholera (1985). His works have achieved significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success, most notably for popularizing a literary style labeled as magic realism, which uses magical elements and events in otherwise ordinary and realistic situations. Some of his works are set in a fictional village called Macondo (the town mainly inspired by his birthplace Aracataca), and most of them explore the theme of solitude.\n\nR.I.P Gabriel GarcÃƒÂ­a MÃƒÂ¡rquez (6 March 1927 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 17 April 2014)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://s18.postimg.org/hpuzsq9mx/RIP.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://s18.postimg.org/hpuzsq9mx/RIP.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n_____\n\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
