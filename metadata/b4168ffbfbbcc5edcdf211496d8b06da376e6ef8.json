You're not a warrior. You're not a soldier. You are, however, the last line of defense between the remaining living crew and deadly reanimated corpses. The undead have become Necromorphs; horrific zombie-alien hybrids that won't succumb to traditional means. Fortunately, your offense is equally unique, as the high-powered mining tools at your disposal provide the means to fight against the threat.\n\nMessy monster slaying.\nThe Necromorphs are unlike any enemies you've seen before. Headshots do about as much damage to them as flicking rubber bands. To survive, you'll need to dismember their insect-like limbs, one at a time.\n\nImprovised weapons.\nThere aren't many traditional firearms aboard the Ishimura, but there's plenty of stopping power in Isaac's toolkit. Send horizontal or vertical blasts of energy at enemies with the Plasma Cutter, remotely control a high-speed sawblade with the Disc Ripper, and fill hallways with wide swaths of destruction with the Line Gun. Switch things up with alternate fire modes, and purchase upgrades to increase ammo, power, and reload speed.\n\nReal-time attacks.\nWhatever you do, donâ€™t drop your guard. Everything takes place in real-time. That means any action you take, whether it be reloading or digging through your inventory, gives the Necromorphs a perfect opportunity to attack. This nightmare has just begun and itâ€™s up to you to get to the bottom of what happened here.\n\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: XP (SP2) /Vista /7 /8 /10\nProcessor: 2.8 GHz or faster\nMemory: 1 GB RAM or more for Windows XP (2 GB for Vista /7 /8 /10)\nGraphics: DirectX 9.0c compatible video card, Shader Model 3.0 required, 256 MB or better, NVIDIA GeForce 6800 or better (7300, 7600 GS, and 8500 are below minimum system requirements), ATI X1600 Pro or better (X1300, X1300 Pro and HD2400 are below minimum system requirements)\nHard Drive: 11 GB free space\nSound: DirectX 9.0c compatible sound card","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4168ffbfbbcc5edcdf211496d8b06da376e6ef8","amp;dn":"Dead+Space+%28v2.0.0.2%29+%5BGOG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4168ffbfbbcc5edcdf211496d8b06da376e6ef8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,22,143,251,251,188,197,237,205,242,17,73,109,139,6,218,55,110,110,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
