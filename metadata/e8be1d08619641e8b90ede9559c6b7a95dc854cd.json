Multitrack\nrecording. Comprehensive MIDI sequencing. Over 1,000 loops.\n\nWhat&amp;#039;s New in Version 6.0\n* Multitrack audio and MIDI recording\n* Input monitoring for audio recording\n* Multiple media clips per track (including copy-and-paste of events\nbetween tracks)\n* Automatic crossfades between overlapping events\n* MIDI editing on the timeline\n* MIDI track envelopes and keyframes for continuous controller,\nprogram change, and VSTi parameter automation\n* Processing and filtering for MIDI events\n* MIDI input filters for tracks\n* Drum grid timeline editing mode with drum map editor\n* Program map editor for external MIDI devices\n* MIDI export\n* Project sections for easy arranging\n* Envelope automation recording\n* Freehand envelope drawing on the timeline\n* Enhanced paint tool for MIDI, one-shot, and Beatmapped clips\n* Dynamic playback optimization maximizes audio performance\n* Support for control surfaces including the Mackie Control Universal\nand Frontier TranzPort\n* GracenoteÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ MusicIDÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ technology for extracting audio from CDs (not\navailable in trial mode)\n* Film-style panning mode for 5.1 surround projects\n\nv6.0c (2006.10.27)\n* Fixed a problem that could cause a hang when AASÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯s Lounge Lizard 3\nis opened and an ACID project is autosaved.\n* Default patch settings are not applied to VSTi soft synths when new\ntracks are added to a project.\n* Fixed a bug so MP3s with Unicode ID3 tag information no longer cause\nproblems with track names.\n* A drawing issue has been resolved involving drum maps with note data\noutside their drum map parameters.\n* Fixed a problem that could cause a crash when deleting a bus from a\n5.1 surround sound project.\n* Fixed a variety of issues with the Piano Roll Editor caused by\ndragging files from the Explorer to the ACID timeline.\n* Fixed a bug so that MIDI notes selected using the in inline editing\nmode will play as displayed while loops are being previewed.\n* Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when rendering to a new track\nusing M-Audio Ozone with a USB connection.\n* In 5.1 surround mode, when a track is routed to a bus, the Surround\nMaster now receives the input monitoring signal.\n* You can now pan tracks that are routed to a bus in stereo and 5.1\nsurround modes.\n* Fixed a bug so bus levels are preserved after selecting Undo after a\nbus has been deleted.\n* Fixed a bug that grayed out VSTi sub-busses when the main bus was\nmuted.\n* Fixed a bug that caused audio to stutter or drop out entirely during\nplayback after UAD-1 effects had been added to the project.\n* Fixed a bug so that busses are renamed to their default names when a\nnew project with busses is opened using ACIDÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯s default settings.\n* Various improvements have been made for using ACID as a ReWire\ndevice.\n* Fixed various VSTi window sizing issues.\n* Added program change maps for the Korg Karma, Korg Triton rack\n(system version 1.52), and E-mu Planet Earth.\n* Resolved an issue so audio and MIDI ports remain open when focus is\nlost and the Preferences pane is open.\n* You can now undo a key change to a MIDI clip.\n* Fixed a bug that could cause ACID to hang when adding keyframes to\n5.1 surround projects.\n* Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when you import MIDI files with\nno note data into your project.\n* Fixed a bug that prevented NI Akoustik Piano, E-mu Emulator X, and\nProteus X from loading properly.\n* Resolved two issues regarding undoing MIDI program changes:\n  -Undoing a MIDI program change now updates MIDI drum maps with the\nproper settings.\n  -Undoing a MIDI program change now updates MIDI devices or soft\nsynths with the proper settings.\n* Fixed a bug that caused audio glitches at the start of playback in a\nproject with two MIDI tracks routed to a DLS soft synth.\n* Fixed a problem with incorrect event clips caused by removing unused\nclips and then selecting Undo.\n* Resolved an issue so that you have the option of choosing any audio\neditor that is configured and not just the first one listed under the\nTools menu.\n* Implemented key support for MIDI clips. You can set a MIDI clip&amp;#039;s\nkey on the Clip Pool tab of the MIDI Track Properties window. A clip&amp;#039;s\nkey affects playback and now notes are drawn in events.\n  -When you create a new MIDI clip, the key is set to None.\n  -When you open a MIDI file, ACID will set the clip&amp;#039;s key based on\nthe MIDI file. If a clip contains key changes, only the first is used.\n  -When you open a MIDI file as a project, the ACID project key is\nupdated to match the MIDI file.\n  -When a clip&amp;#039;s key is set, the project key and key change markers\nare applied to MIDI clips. MIDI notes in events are drawn as WYSIWYH\n   (what you see is what you hear).\n* Implemented various optimizations for memory usage and performance.\n* Improved performance for ASIO drivers that do not notify host\napplications of buffer-size changes.\n* Improved handling for MIDI track, clip, and event pitch-shifting.\n* Clip names in the Clip Pool window are now updated when clips are\nsaved to new file names.\n* Fixed a bug that prevented arming multiple MIDI tracks for\nrecording.\n* Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when renaming an unnamed clip\nin the Clip Pool.\n* Fixed a problem that could cause MIDI clips to drop notes during\nlooped playback.\n* An issue has been resolved that prevented FXPansion BFD MIDI files\nfrom being added to the ACID timeline.\n* Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when changing the channel of a\ntrack routed to a ReWire device.\n* Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when closing Reason when in use\nby tracks in your ACID project.\n* Fixed a problem that could cause a crash when playing back with\ncertain audio plug-ins (including Antares Filter and Sony Pitch\nShift).\n* Fixed a problem that could cause a crash or hang when using the Undo\ncommand after MIDI step recording.\n* Fixed a problem that could cause a hang when arming an audio track\nfor recording while recording MIDI data.\n* Fixed a problem that could cause NRPN and RPN MIDI data sent to the\nDLS soft synth to respond incorrectly to pitch bend or controller\ndata.\n* Fixed a bug that could cause dropouts when routing a multichannel\nVSTi&amp;#039;s outputs to a bus other than the Master bus.\n* Fixed a bug that could cause dropouts or timing irregularities when\nrouting a multichannel VSTi to a non-in-place plug-in (such as Time\nStretch, Pitch-Shift without preserving duration, and some Vibrato\nsettings).\n* Fixed a problem that could cause the MIDI Step Record dialog to\nremain active after canceling step recording.\n\n[ Install Notes ]\n\n1. Double-click the file, and then follow the on-screen prompts to\n   install the appropriate version of ACID Pro for your computer.\n2. Register with serial/activation code generated by keygen (you need to\n   go through &quot;..From Another Computer&quot; activation method).\n   If you need to activate ac3/mp3/mpeg plug-ins, also use &quot;...From Another\n   Computer&quot; activation and register plug-ins with codes from keygen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8be1d08619641e8b90ede9559c6b7a95dc854cd","amp;dn":"Sony+Acid+Pro+6+Including+Keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8be1d08619641e8b90ede9559c6b7a95dc854cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,190,29,8,97,150,65,232,185,14,222,149,89,198,183,169,93,200,84,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
