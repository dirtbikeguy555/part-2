And itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all under surveillance by an alien presence that refuses to show itself.\n\nDaniel Bruks is a living fossil: a field biologist in a world where biology has turned computational, a cat's-paw used by terrorists to kill thousands. Taking refuge in the Oregon desert, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s turned his back on a humanity that shatters into strange new subspecies with every heartbeat. But he awakens one night to find himself at the center of a storm that will turn all of history inside-out.\n  \nNow heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trapped on a ship bound for the center of the solar system. To his left is a grief-stricken soldier, obsessed by whispered messages from a dead son. To his right is a pilot who hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t yet found the man she's sworn to kill on sight. A vampire and its entourage of zombie bodyguards lurk in the shadows behind. And dead ahead, a handful of rapture-stricken monks takes them all to a meeting with something they will only call Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Angels of the Asteroids.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nTheir pilgrimage brings Dan Bruks, the fossil man, face-to-face with the biggest evolutionary breakpoint since the origin of thought itself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e41a7886b63b88016963d2bfcc5c4f9ff43f933","amp;dn":"Peter+Watts+-+Echopraxia+%28epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e41a7886b63b88016963d2bfcc5c4f9ff43f933","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,65,167,136,107,99,184,128,22,150,61,43,252,197,196,249,255,67,249,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
