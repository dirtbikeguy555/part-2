Focused squarely on that prime era, 1970 through 1974, the collection begins with his only Top Ten hit, 1973&amp;#039;s irrepressibly fatalistic &quot;Right Place, Wrong Time.&quot; Two others come from his best album (1973&amp;#039;s In the Right Place), the jaunty &quot;Such a Night&quot; and &quot;Qualified.&quot; 1972&amp;#039;s Dr. John&amp;#039;s Gumbo also rates three tracks: the New Orleans classics &quot;Iko Iko&quot; and &quot;Tipitina,&quot; plus &quot;Junko Partner.&quot; The compilers were also wise to choose three songs from Gris-Gris, his unjustly neglected psychedelic debut, including &quot;Mama Roux&quot; and &quot;I Walk on Guilded Splinters&quot; (but unfortunately, not the glorious &quot;Gris-Gris Gumbo Ya Ya&quot;). A version of Jimmy Liggins&amp;#039; jump-blues classic &quot;Honeydripper,&quot; from 1981&amp;#039;s Dr. John Plays Mac Rebennack, spotlights his sparkling boogie-woogie piano, and the set closes with a pair of standards from his latter-day Warner Bros. years (one of which is the unofficial Mardi Gras theme &quot;Goin&amp;#039; Back to New Orleans&quot;). \nWhether it&amp;#039;s for a first listen or the perfect road-trip disc, The Very Best of Dr. John has all of the New Orleans master&amp;#039;s best recordings in one spot.\n\n\n\n01.
