A final section on issues and debates allows students to cast a critical eye on the research process, to explore the nature of Psychology as an evolving science, and understand some of the ethical issues faced by Psychologists.\n\n\n\nPaperback: 901 pages\nPublisher: Hodder Arnold Publishers; 6 edition (July 4, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 144410831X\nISBN-13: 978-1444108316                                              \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec524f4f20197ab297d0ad6a7c919bd0787fc95e","amp;dn":"Psychology%3A+The+Science+of+Mind+and+Behaviour%2C+6th+Ed%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec524f4f20197ab297d0ad6a7c919bd0787fc95e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,82,79,79,32,25,122,178,151,208,173,106,124,145,155,208,120,127,201,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
