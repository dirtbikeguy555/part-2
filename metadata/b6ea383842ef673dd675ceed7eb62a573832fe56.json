The book opens the black-box and reveals the architecture of risk-modeling and financial engineering based on industry-standard stochastic models by utilizing Excel and VBA functionality to create a robust and practical modeling tool-kit. Financial engineering professionals who purchase this book will have a jumpstart advantage for their customized financial engineering and modeling needs.&quot;\nDr. Cameron Wicentowich\nVice President, Treasury Analytics\nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC)\n&quot;Spreadsheet modeling for finance has become a standard course in the curriculum of many Quantitative Finance programs since the Excel-based Visual Basic programming is now widely used in constructing optimal portfolios, pricing structured products and managing risks. Professional Financial Computing Using Excel and VBA is written by a unique team of finance, physics and computer academics and practitioners. It is a good reference for those who are studying for a Masters degree in Financial Engineering and Risk Management. It can also be useful for financial engineers to jump-start a project on designing structured products, modeling interest term structure or credit risks.&quot;\nDr. Jin Zhang\nDirector of Master of Finance Program and Associate Professor\nThe University of Hong Kong\n\n&quot;Excel has been one of the most powerful tools for financial planning and computing over the last few years. Most users utilize a fraction of its capabilities. One of the reasons is the limited availability of books that cover the advanced features of Excel for Finance. Professional Financial Computing Using Excel and VBA goes the extra mile and deals with the Excel tools many professionals call for. This book is a must for professionals or students dealing with financial engineering, financial risk management, computational finance or mathematical finance. I loved the way the authors covered the material using real life, hands-on examples.&quot;\nDr. Isaac Gottlieb\nTemple University\nAuthor, Next Generation Excel: Modeling in Excel for Analysts and MBAs\n\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPreface ix\nCHAPTER 1 Financial Engineering and Computing 1\n\n1.1 Financial Engineering and Spreadsheet Modeling 1\n\n1.2 Lehman Brothers' Products for Retail Investors 3\n\n1.3 Risk Management and Basel II 4\n\n1.4 About the Book 4\n\n1.5.
