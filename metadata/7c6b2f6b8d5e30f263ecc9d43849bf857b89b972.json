Creep On Creepin Ons title is no mistake: Taylor Kirk and company take inspiration for the follow-up to their Polaris Prize long-listed self-titled album from seances, witchcraft, murder ballads, swampy rockabilly slow dances, and horror movies. Yet within this black-on-black palette, Kirk finds fine shadings of meaning and mood that keep these songs from being too monotonous, self-serious or campy. Bad Ritual opens the album with Kirk remembering a departed lover, though lyrics like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthere is proof in boxesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI felt your poltergeist presentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ suggest she may not have left of her own accord; Black Water swirls imagery of Viking funerals and polluted lakes into murk that belies ages upon ages of weirdness.
