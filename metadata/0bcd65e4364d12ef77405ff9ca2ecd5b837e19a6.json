There\\'s just something about the historical nature of the games that appeals to me. To be fair, I think elves and space marines are neat too, but I think it\\'s more exciting to explore the what ifs of real, historical situations. Though not quite as faithful to \\&quot;reality\\&quot; as some strategy games, the first two Age games offered us exciting sojourns into the worlds of \\&quot;capital A\\&quot; Ancient and Medieval strategy. The third title, Age of Mythology, proved that the mechanics were just as solid even if the historical inspiration was a little loose.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bcd65e4364d12ef77405ff9ca2ecd5b837e19a6","amp;dn":"Age+of+Empire+3+relaoded+full+pc+game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bcd65e4364d12ef77405ff9ca2ecd5b837e19a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,205,101,228,54,77,18,239,119,64,95,249,202,46,205,91,131,126,25,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
