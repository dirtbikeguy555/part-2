TriOptimum Corporation: we give you the stars!\n\nThe second--and best!--game in the series stands all on its own as a masterpiece of gaming history. The starship Von Braun took a giant leap for mankind as it made its first interstellar journey. The mission was going as planned until a lone distress call from the Tau Ceti V sector was picked up. An away team was sent on a rescue mission, but once it arrived at its destination, there was no sign of any humans and the source of the signal remained unclear. They didn't realize something crucial, though: they brought something back with them when they returned. Now, you--a member of the ship's security team--awake from cryostasis to the sounds of screams of pain and horror as everything falls apart. The state-of-the-art spaceship becomes a deathtrap, and the only hope you have is the contemptuous whisper of a voice guiding you through the dark corridors, leading you towards the ominous secrets that lurk in the shadows.\nA game like this is a masterpiece; you must experience it firsthand. System ShockÃ¢â€žÂ¢ 2 arguably offers the most intense storytelling in the history of computer games. It perfectly splices Sci-Fi with survival horror, FPS gameplay with character stats, upgrades, and inventory system of the role-playing genre, fast paced action with chilling terror. \n\n-&quot;10 out of 10&quot; - Computer Games Magazine\n-&quot;An advanced, progressive spin on first-person gaming&quot; - Edge Online\n-&quot;One of the 100 best games of all time&quot; - Empire Online\n-&quot;95%&quot; - PC Gamer\n-&quot;Greatest Games of all Times&quot; list - Gamespot\n-&quot;Top 50 Greatest Games of All Time&quot; list - Gamespy\n\n\nFeatures:\n===========\n\nÃ‚Â¤ Choose from 3 specialized branches of the military to utilize unique skills, weaponry, and paranormal psionic powers. \nÃ‚Â¤ Upgrade and enhance your skills to improve hacking, weapon proficiency, and psionic abilities. \nÃ‚Â¤ Discover cryptic audio logs, encounter ghostly apparitions and conduct research to give you the advantage in combat and unlock exotic weapons and items. \nÃ‚Â¤ Play with up to three friends in multiplayer co-op (co-op works in Windows only)\n\n\nVersion: \n==========\n\nv2.42 or GOG setup v2.1.1.20 - current official \nand patch 2.43 for GOG PC verison from August 21, 2014 - submitted to GOG team, but not yet officially released\n\n\nVersion changes:\n==================\n\nPatch 2.43 (for PC):\n- updated to NewDark 2.43 \n- included one folder to load mods, to mirror the steam version \n\nInstructions:1.
