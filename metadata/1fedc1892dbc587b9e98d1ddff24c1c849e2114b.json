The original trailer has a quick shot of Chekov who just died in the main episode they riffed so they express outrage but the 720p trailer doesn't show Chekov. Also, the credits were repeated so there's video while the riffers do the intro for the episode.\r\n\r\nThis is a remux with the Rifftrax commentary added as the default audio track. The Rifftrax audio track has been newly remastered to ensure the riff comments are just loud enough to be clear when the movie is loud and not too loud when the movie is quiet. Please leave any feedback regarding the Rifftrax audio remastering.\r\n\r\nIf this Rifftrax was enjoyable, you haven't paid for it and you have a few dollars to spare, please consider purchasing this riff (3.99USD) or make a general donation via CCard, PPal, Bitcoin/Dogecoin/Litecoin or wallet payment apps at\r\n\r\nPlease check out other releases of Rifftrax, MST3K, Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek, Gotham, DC Comics, documentaries, and more at:\r\n  https://thepiratebay.org/user/bsg4you/  \r\nand leave any corrections, criticism, comments and requests.\r\n\r\nThanks, bsg4you\r\n\r\nPS - here are the custom named chapters:\r\nCh01 Blue Text Of Warning\r\nCh02 NBC Peacock\r\nCh03 &quot;And We're Back&quot;\r\nCh04 Opening Credits Song\r\nCh05 &quot;Exploding Whales!&quot;\r\nCh06 More Opening Credits\r\nCh07 &quot;And Now Back To More Bonobo&quot;\r\nCh08 &quot;Man, They're Gonna Need A Lotta Bondo&quot;\r\nCh09 &quot;Are You Paying Too Much For Life Insurance?&quot;\r\nCh10 &quot;Uh!
