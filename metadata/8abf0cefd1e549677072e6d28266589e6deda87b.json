Starting with the VikingsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ kennings and Beowulf and ending with Stevenson and Oscar Wilde, the book traverses a landscape of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœprecursors,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢cross-cultural borrowings, and genres of expression, all connected by Borges into a vast interpretive web. This is the most surprising and useful of BorgesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s works to have appeared posthumously.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nBorges takes us on a startling, idiosyncratic, fresh, and highly opinionated tour of English literature, weaving together countless cultural traditions of the last three thousand years. BorgesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lectures Ã¢â‚¬â€ delivered extempore by a man of extraordinary erudition Ã¢â‚¬â€ bring the canon to remarkably vivid life. Now translated into English for the first time, these lectures are accompanied by extensive and informative notes by the Borges scholars MartÃƒÂ­n Arias and MartÃƒÂ­n Hadis.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8abf0cefd1e549677072e6d28266589e6deda87b","amp;dn":"A+Course+on+English+Literature+by+Jorge+Luis+Borges","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8abf0cefd1e549677072e6d28266589e6deda87b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,191,12,239,209,229,73,103,112,114,230,210,130,102,88,158,109,237,168,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
