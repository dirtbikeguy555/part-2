At its most basic, though, we can say that it's the creation of any inanimate object that motivates a fellow human being. That motivation could be anything from going out to buy a new car ?? the point of vehicle design and of those adverts that trumpet their benefits - to simply stopping for a moment and appreciating the art before them.\nDesign is a deeply ingrained part of the human psyche. Since the earliest days when we were painting on cave walls, we have been interested In creating objects that tell a story or simply brighten up our surroundings, proving that the need to design is an inherent urge in all of us. Over the years, of course, things have changed, tastes have evolved and technology arnved, but still that desire remains. The advent of the computer elevated design into a whole new level. No longer were we restricted to sculpting, painting or drawing with physical objects; now we could create in a virtual space on a screen, change our creations as often as we wanted and finally output a definitive copy to share with family, friends and the world at large.\nAnd that's where The Ultimate Guide to Graphic Design 2nd Edition can help. Over the course of almost 200 pages, we'll show you how you can harness the power of your computer to create more professional, appealing and engaging work that you'll be proud to show, and which will impress those who see it.\nWith full coverage of Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, QuarkXPress and more, our team of expert writers will guide you step by step through each task at hand.
