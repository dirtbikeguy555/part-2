I can't find it. The Epitaph from &quot;Plan Your Escape&quot; is not the right one.\n\n\nEnjoy, seed.\n\nIf you like the artist, I urge you to buy from them. I wouldn't put this urge on artists like U2 or 50 Cent or Lady Gaga; they don't need it. Hey Rosetta! is a small band and they are WORTH BUYING. This torrent is provided as for many non-Canadians it is almost impossible to buy Hey Rosetta! music as Sony's an idiot. If you're Canadian, spend the cash and think of it as buying these guys dinner and getting free music for it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d21228c12a583fdb092976caabcaf3750097c762","amp;dn":"Hey+Rosetta%21+-+Full+Discography+%282005+-+2010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d21228c12a583fdb092976caabcaf3750097c762","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,18,40,193,42,88,63,219,9,41,118,202,171,202,243,117,0,151,199,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
