You need aboot $100 in tools, then you can assemble new rounds of ammunition from commercially available components.\n\nThis collection of books is the result of more than a dozen years as a handloading instructor. I hope it helps many of you find the right load.\n\nThese are all new scans from February, 2011. None of these files have ever been on the torrents before.\n\nAll PDFs are made up of page images, so there are NO TYPE-OHS that could cause ka-booms! The files that end in \\\\\\&quot;- ocr.pdf\\\\\\&quot; have a layer of text under the page image to make them kinda-searchable. This layer of text has not been proofread, and should not be trusted.\n\nplease check my other torrents on ThePirateBay. I have many other gun related torrents. I\\\\\\'ll post at least a torrent a week as I am digitizing my entire library of paper books.\n\nIf you find errors, such as missing pages, please bring them to my attention. Post a comment, and I\\\\\\'ll try to correct it.\n\nRecycledElectrons\n\nHere\\\\\\'s the contents:\n\nBuckshot Loading III - Ballistic Products Inc - 2004.pdf\nCartridges of the World - 8th Edition - 1997.pdf\nCombat Loads for the Sniper Rifle - Desert Press - 2004.pdf\nEarly Loading Tools &amp; Bullet Molds - some pages are skewed.pdf\nGun Digest Book of Handgun Reloading, The - by Dean A Grennell - 1987.pdf\nHandloader\\\\\\'s Manual of Cartridge Conversions, The - ocr.pdf\nHodgon.pdf\nPrecision Handloading - 1985  ocr.pdf\nReloaders Digest --- 6th Edition --- 1972 - ocr.pdf\nHandbook of Commercial Bullet Casting, The - 2nd Edition.pdf\nLyman Cast Bullet Handbook - 3rd Edition - 1980 - ocr.pdf\nComplete Reloading Manual for the 357 Magnum.pdf\nComplete Reloading Manual for the 454 Casull.pdf\nComplete Reloading Manual for the 7.62x39.pdf\nMidwayUsa LoadMap 357Magnum.pdf\nMidwayUsa LoadMap 44RemingtonMagnum.pdf\nMidwayUsa LoadMap 45ACP.pdf\nMidwayUsa LoadMap 9mm.pdf\nABCs of Reloading - Lee Precision - 2004.pdf\nComplete Handloader, The -  by John Wooters.pdf\nHornady Handbook of Cartridge Reloading - 3rd Edition - 1980.pdf\nHornady Handbook of Cartridge Reloading - 4th Edition - Volume 1.pdf\nHornady Handbook of Cartridge Reloading - 4th Edition - Volume 2.pdf\nLyman Reloading Handbook - 48th Edition - 2002 - ocr.pdf\nLyman Reloading Handbook --- 44th Edition --- 1967.pdf\nModern Reloading 2nd Edition by Richard Lee - ocr.pdf\nSpeer Reloading Manual - 12th Edition - 1995 -.pdf\nLyman Shotshell Handbook - 3rd Edition - 1984.pdf\nRCBS Handbook of Shotshell Reloading, The - Kenneth W Couger - 2007 - ocr.pdf\nReloading for Shotgunners - 3rd Edition - 1993.pdf\nReloading for Shotgunners - 5th Edition - by Rick Sapp - MEC &amp; BPI - 2005.pdf\nShotshells &amp; Ballistics - by John Taylor - 2003.pdf\nSKR Handbook of Shotshell Reloading - 1984.pdf\nAlliant Powder Reloaders Guide - 2000.pdf\nAlliant Powder Reloaders Guide - 2002.pdf\nAlliant Powder Reloaders Guide - 2005.pdf\nIMR Handloaders Guide for Smokeless Powders.pdf\nIMR Smokeless Powder Reloading Guide --- April 2004.pdf\nSpeer Manual for Reloading Ammunition --- Number 6 --- 1964.pdf\nWinchester.pdf\n41 File(s)  6,949,868,041 bytes\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8583be17f2d1cc7a44ff719a73cfd022c45344a8","amp;dn":"Reloading","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8583be17f2d1cc7a44ff719a73cfd022c45344a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,131,190,23,242,209,204,122,68,255,113,154,115,207,208,34,196,83,68,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
