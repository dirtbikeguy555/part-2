If you have a basic knowledge of the language and want to further your expertise, Pro Objective-C is the book for you.\n\nPro Objective-C provides an in-depth, comprehensive guide to the language, its runtime, and key APIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s. It explains the key concepts of Objective-C in a clear, easy to understand manner, and also provides detailed coverage of its more complex features. In addition, the book includes numerous practical examples--code excerpts and complete applications--that demonstrate how to apply in code what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re learning.\n\nThe book begins with an exploration of Objective-C's basic features and key language elements. After reviewing the basics, it proceeds with an in-depth examination of the Objective-C dynamic programming features and runtime system. Next the book covers the Foundation Framework, the base layer of APIs that can be used for any Objective-C program. Finally, new and advanced features of Objective-C are introduced and shown how they make the Objective-C language even more powerful and expressive.\n\nEach topic is covered thoroughly and is packed with the details you need to develop Objective-C code effectively. The most important features are given in-depth treatment, and each chapter contains numerous examples that demonstrate both the power and the subtlety of Objective-C.\n\nStart reading Pro Objective-C and begin developing high-quality, professional apps on the OS X and iOS platforms using the Objective-C programming language!\n\nWhat youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn\n\n    Objective-C fundamentals and key language elements\n    Objective-C runtime system\n    Foundation Framework APIs\n    Objective-C advanced language features\n    Xcode Essentials\n    Debugging with LLDB \n\nWho this book is for\n\nThis book is geared towards intermediate to advanced developers who already have some Objective-C experience and want pro-level coverage of the language, including advanced Objective-C features, recent additions to the language, and practical usage of its core frameworks and APIs. It's also great for those developers not familiar with Objective-C that have done some C programming and also understand object-oriented programming concepts.\n\nTable of Contents\n\n    Getting Started\n    Using Classes\n    Objects and Messaging\n    Memory Management\n    The Preprocessor\n    Expert Section - Using ARC\n    Runtime System\n    Runtime Architecture\n    Expert Section - Using the Runtime APIs\n    Foundation Framework General Purpose Classes\n    Foundation Framework System Services\n    Foundation Framework Specialized Services\n    Foundation Functions and Data Types\n    Expert Section - Error Handling\n    Blocks\n    Objective-C Literals\n    Concurrent Programming\n    Key-Value Programming\n    Appendix A: Language Elements\n    Appendix B: Xcode Xposed!\n    Appendix C: Using LLDB \n\n\nPublisher: Apress; 1 edition (September 3, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 143025050X\nISBN-13: 978-1430250500","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a40e937ee513c6c448d17fa97b4393dfeabe9448","amp;dn":"%5BKeith+Lee%5DPro+Objective-C+%28pdf%29%7BZzzzz%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a40e937ee513c6c448d17fa97b4393dfeabe9448","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,14,147,126,229,19,198,196,72,209,127,169,123,67,147,223,234,190,148,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
