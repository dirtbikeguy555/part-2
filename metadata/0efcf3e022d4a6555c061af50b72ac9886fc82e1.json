It was released by Columbia Records on November 22, 2005. The album was nominated for Best Rock Album at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nThe trio features John Mayer (guitar/lead vocals), Pino Palladino (bass), and Steve Jordan (drums/backup vocals). Unlike previous efforts by John Mayer, Try! focuses on popular blues renditions rather than adult-contemporary pop songs. The CD includes two cover songs, &quot;Wait Until Tomorrow&quot; by Jimi Hendrix, and &quot;I Got a Woman&quot; by Ray Charles; two of Mayer's previous album, Heavier Things''s songs, &quot;Daughters&quot; and &quot;Something's Missing&quot;; and also showcased two songs from Mayer's then forthcoming album, Continuum, &quot;Vultures&quot; and &quot;Gravity&quot;.\n\nCritical response to the album was mixed, with most critics being impressed with Mayer's progression and Palladino and Jordan's musicianship, while still being underwhelmed. Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone said, &quot;over most of these sixty-three minutes [of the album], Mayer proves he can bowl you over, not just make your knees weak,&quot; ultimately giving the album three out of five stars. Katy Hastey of Billboard found that &quot;while &quot;Try!&quot; is brimming with talent, it's not consistently compelling.&quot; People magazine heartily praised the album, concluding, &quot;Here's hoping Mayer keeps this new groove going for his next solo disc.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0efcf3e022d4a6555c061af50b72ac9886fc82e1","amp;dn":"John+Mayer+Trio+-+Try+%5B+Flac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0efcf3e022d4a6555c061af50b72ac9886fc82e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,252,243,224,34,212,166,85,92,6,26,245,11,114,172,152,134,252,130,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
