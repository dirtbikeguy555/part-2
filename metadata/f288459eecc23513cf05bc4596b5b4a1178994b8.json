It is the official sequel to the wildly popular and immensely successful personal impact simulator - Stair Dismount.\r\n\r\nThe highlights of this experience are multiple vehicles, an awesome replay system, level editing features, high-speed physics and an indiscriminate sense of style.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the game is simple - damage awards points. It is up to you to try different combinations of obstacles, vehicles, poses and levels to make it to the top of the leaderboards. To support friendly rivalry, Turbo Dismount supports placing a photo of your friend on the face of Mr. Dismount - such a delightful way to express one's emotions!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f288459eecc23513cf05bc4596b5b4a1178994b8","amp;dn":"Turbo+Dismount+v1.16.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f288459eecc23513cf05bc4596b5b4a1178994b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,136,69,158,236,194,53,19,207,5,188,69,150,181,180,161,23,137,148,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
