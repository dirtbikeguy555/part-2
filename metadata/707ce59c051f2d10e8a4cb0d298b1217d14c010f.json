The game is split into day and night cycles. During the day, you spend time gathering resources, whether it be searching for ore, digging holes, fishing or planting crops. Night is spent either indoors, mining underground tunnels, building tools or running around outside being chased by monsters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:707ce59c051f2d10e8a4cb0d298b1217d14c010f","amp;dn":"Minecraft+1.4.7+%28TeamExtreme%29+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"707ce59c051f2d10e8a4cb0d298b1217d14c010f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,124,229,156,5,31,45,16,232,164,203,13,41,139,18,23,209,76,1,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
