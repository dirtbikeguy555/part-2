Innocence is where we all begin. Instinct can quickly take over. A lifetime is spent in this internal tug of war between who we really are and who we hope to be. Produced by the award-winning Rob Graves, mixed by Ben Grosse (Sevendust, Disturbed, Depeche Mode) and including a song co-written by Benjamin Burnley of Breaking Benjamin, Innocence &amp; Instinct is thoughtful and powerful rock music, with a challenging look at the personal struggle inside each of us.\n[Source: Amazon.com]\n\nRelease Year: 2009\nGenre: Alternative Metal, Christian Metal, Hard Rock, Nu Metal\n\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01.
