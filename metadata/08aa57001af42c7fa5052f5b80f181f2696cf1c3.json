Notwithstanding this curious beginning, the group went on to a series of hits in the mid-'80s, including the chart-toppers &quot;We Built This City,&quot; &quot;Sara,&quot; and &quot;Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now&quot; in a polished, mainstream pop/rock style before splitting up in the early '90s.Starship was the remaining sextet of musicians that, with Paul Kantner, had made up Jefferson Starship until the rhythm guitarist/singer's exit from that band in June 1984. Kantner, a founding member of Jefferson Airplane, the precursor to Jefferson Starship, had also helped found Jefferson Starship in 1974. Ten years later, Kantner decried the band's tilt toward commercial rock and decided that it was time for the group to dissolve. His bandmates disagreed, and Kantner sued over money and the ownership of the band's name in October 1984. The suit was settled in March 1985, resulting in a cash payment to Kantner and the agreement that the name &quot;Jefferson Starship&quot; would be retired, while the band would change its name to simply Starship (with that name owned by singer Grace Slick and manager Bill Thompson).\n\n\n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.
