Now you will be able to encode your details or any other information, including price lists, URLs, etc., into QR or Data Matrix barcodes and include this barcode on your business card. This barcode can later be read by many mobile devices. 2D barcodes will make your card look unique and let the world know that your business is progressively keeping up with today's technology.\n\nEditing Tools\n\nApart from that, various design and layout tools were added or improved, making the business card design process more extensive. This includes object grouping, linear and radial gradient, new guideline capabilities and more.\n\nWorking with Photos\n\nBusiness Card Composer 5 is now more robust when it comes to working with your photos. The program now supports iPhoto events. We also added the ability to access photos from your Apple Aperture library right inside of Business Card Composer.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nMac OS X.5 or later (Lion compatible)\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2619e8ab4e2959af21826bae81e32176b69c9e55","amp;dn":"Business+Card+Composer+v.5.1.4+with+%5BK%5Drack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2619e8ab4e2959af21826bae81e32176b69c9e55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,25,232,171,78,41,89,175,33,130,107,174,129,227,33,118,182,156,158,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
