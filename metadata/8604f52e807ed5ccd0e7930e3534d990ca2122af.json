It starts in your mother's womb, accelerates to high speed in infancy and childhood, and continues through every age, whether you're actively engaged in mastering a new skill, intuitively discovering an unfamiliar place, or just sleeping, which is fundamental to helping you consolidate and hold on to what you've learned. You are truly born to learn around the clock.\n\nBut few of us know how we learn, which is the key to learning and studying more effectively. For example, you may be surprised by the following:\n\nPeople tend to misjudge what they have learned well, what they don't yet know, and what they do and do not need to practice.\nMoments of confusion, frustration, uncertainty, and lack of confidence are part of the process of acquiring new skills and new knowledge.\nHumans and animals explore their worlds for the sake of learning, regardless of rewards and punishment connected with success.\nYou can teach an old dog new tricks. In fact, older learners have the benefit of prior knowledge and critical skillsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½two advantages in learning.\nShedding light on what's going on when we learn and dispelling common myths about the subject, How We Learn introduces you to this practical and accessible science in 24 half-hour lectures presented by Professor Monisha Pasupathi of the University of Utah, an award-winning psychology teacher and expert on how people of all ages learn.\n\nA Course about You\n\nCustomers of The Great Courses are already devoted to lifelong learning and may be surprised at how complicated the process of learning is. We have a single word for itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½learnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½but it occurs in a fascinating variety of ways, which Professor Pasupathi recounts in detail. She describes a wide range of experiments that may strike a familiar chord as you recognize something about yourself or others:\n\nScripts: We have trouble recalling specific events until we have first learned scripts for those events. Young children are prodigious learners of scripts, but so are first-time parents, college freshmen, foreign travelers, and new employees.\nVariable ratio reinforcement: Children whining for candy are usually refused, but the few occasions when parents give in encourage maximal display of the behavior. The same principle is behind the success of slot machines and other unpredictable rewards.\nStorytelling: Telling stories is fundamentally an act of learning about ourselves. The way we recount experiences, usually shortly after the event, has lasting effects on the way we remember those experiences and what we learn from them.\nSleeper effect: Have you ever heard something from an unreliable source and later found yourself believing it? Over time, we tend to remember information but forget the source. Paradoxically, this effect is stronger when the source is less credible.\nDr. Pasupathi's many examples cover the modern history of research on learningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from behaviorist theory in the early 20th century to the most recent debates about whether IQ can be separated from achievement, or whether a spectrum of different learning styles and multiple intelligences really exist.\n\nWhat You Will Learn\n\nYou start by examining 10 myths about learning. These can get in the way of making the fullest use of the extraordinary capacity for learning and include widespread beliefs, such as that college-educated people already know how to maximize learning or that a person must be interested in a subject in order to learn it.\n\nProfessor Pasupathi then covers mistaken theories of learning, such as that lab animals and humans learn in the same way or that the brain is a tabula rasa, a blank slate that can absorb information without preparation. Babies might seem to be a counterexample, showing that you can learn from scratch. However, you examine what newborns must know at birth in order for them to learn so much, so quickly.\n\nNext you explore in depth how humans master different tasks, from learning a native language or a second language, to becoming adept at a sport or a musical instrument, to learning a new city or a problem-solving strategy, to grasping the distinctive style of thinking required in mathematics and science. Then you look inside the learning process itself, where many factors come into play, including what is being learned and the context, along with the emotions, motivations, and goals of the learner. You close by considering individual differences. Some people seem to learn without effort. How do they do it?\n\nTips on Learning\n\nAlong the way, Professor Pasupathi offers frequent advice on how to excel in many different learning situations:\n\nMastering material: Testing yourself is a very effective strategy for mastering difficult material. Try taking a blank sheet of paper and writing down everything you can recall about the subject. Then go back and review the material. Next, try another blank sheet of paper.\nSecond-language learning: Becoming fluent in a second language in adulthood is difficult because your brain is tuned to your native language and misses important clues in the new language. To overcome this obstacle, immerse yourself among native speakers of the new language.\nMotivating a child: When trying to motivate a schoolchild to learn, avoid controlling language, create opportunities to give the child a sense of choice, and be careful about excessive praise and other forms of rewards, which can actually undermine learning.\nMaintaining a learning edge: Middle-aged and older adults can preserve their learning aptitude by exercising to maintain cardiovascular health, staying mentally active, and periodically trying a new challenge, such as learning to draw or studying new dance steps.\nAdventures in Learning\n\nWinner of prestigious teaching awards from her university's chapter of Psi Chi, the National Honor Society in Psychology, Dr. Pasupathi brings today's exciting field of learning research alive. Her descriptions of ongoing work in her field, in which she is a prominent participant, are vivid and insightful, allowing you to put yourself into a given experiment and ask, &quot;How would I react under these circumstances? What does this tell me about my own approach to learning?&quot;\n\nBy the time How We Learn ends, you will appreciate the incredible breadth of what we learn in our lifetimes, understand the commonality and diversity of human learning experiences, and come away with strategies for enhancing your own adventures in learning.\n\n&quot;Learning is a human birthright,&quot; says Professor Pasupathi. &quot;Everything about us is built for lifelong learningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from our unusually long childhood and our large prefrontal cortex to our interest in novelty and challenge.&quot; And she finds reason for optimism about the future of humanity due to our almost miraculous capacity to learn.\n\nAbout Your Professor\n\nDr. Monisha Pasupathi is Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Utah. She holds a Ph.D. in Psychology from Stanford University. She joined the faculty at Utah in 1999 after completing a postdoctoral fellowship at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Germany.\n\nProfessor Pasupathi has been honored multiple times for her teaching. She was named Best Psychology Professor by her university's chapter of Psi Chi, the National Honor Society in Psychology. Psi Chi also awarded her the Outstanding Educator Award and Favorite Professor Award.\n\nProfessor Pasupathi's research focuses on how people of all ages learn from their experiences, particularly through storytelling. She is coeditor of Narrative Development in Adolescence: Creating the Storied Self, and her work has been published widely in scholarly journals.\n\nDirectory of \\TTC Teaching Company - How We Learn 2012\n\n\n01 Myths about Learning.mp3\n02 Why No Single Learning Theory Works.mp3\n03 Learning as Information Processing.mp3\n04 Creating Representations.mp3\n05 Categories, Rules, and Scripts.mp3\n06 What Babies Know.mp3\n07 Learning Your Native Tongue.mp3\n08 Learning a Second Language.mp3\n09 Learning How to Move.mp3\n10 Learning Our Way Around.mp3\n11 Learning to Tell Stories.mp3\n12 Learning Approaches in Math and Science.mp3\n13 Learning as Theory Testing.mp3\n14 Integrating Different Domains of Learning.mp3\n15 Cognitive Constraints on Learning.mp3\n16 Choosing Learning Strategies.mp3\n17 Source Knowledge and Learning.mp3\n18 The Role of Emotion in Learning.mp3\n19 Cultivating a Desire to Learn.mp3\n20 Intelligence and Learning.mp3\n21 Are Learning Styles Real.mp3\n22 Different People, Different Interests.mp3\n23 Learning across the Lifespan.mp3\n24 Making the Most of How We Learn.mp3\nHow We Learn.txt\n\n              25 File(s)   360 MB  (378,290,220 bytes)\n\nTTC Teaching Company - How We Learn 2012","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8604f52e807ed5ccd0e7930e3534d990ca2122af","amp;dn":"TTC+Teaching+Company+-+How+We+Learn+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8604f52e807ed5ccd0e7930e3534d990ca2122af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,4,245,46,128,126,213,204,208,231,147,14,53,52,217,144,202,33,34,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
